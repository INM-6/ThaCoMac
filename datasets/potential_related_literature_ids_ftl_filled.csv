Crossed fronto-thalamic axons reach more lateral regions than those containing contralateral thalamo-frontal neurons.

Therefore, we studied the electrophysiological responses of neurons in the basal ganglia and cerebellar receiving-territories of the motor thalamus (BGMT and CbMT, respectively) using optogenetic activation of corticothalamic projections in awake rhesus macaques. After injections of viral vectors carrying the excitatory opsins ChR2 or C1V1 into the primary motor and premotor cortices of two monkeys, we used optrodes to light activate opsin-expressing neurons in cortex or their terminals in the thalamus while simultaneously recording the extracellular activity of neurons in the vicinity of the stimulation sites. As expected, light activation of opsins in the cerebral cortex evoked robust, short-latency increases in firing of cortical neurons. In contrast, light stimulation of corticothalamic terminals induced small-amplitude, long-latency increases and/or decreases of activity in thalamic neurons. In postmortem material, opsins were found to be expressed in cell bodies and dendrites of cortical neurons and along their corticothalamic projections. At the electron microscopic level, opsin labeling was confined to unmyelinated preterminal axons and small terminals that formed asymmetric synapses with dendrites of projection neurons or GABAergic interneurons in BGMT and CbMT and with neurons in the reticular thalamic nucleus. The morphological features of the transfected terminals, along with the long latency and complex physiological responses of thalamic neurons to their activation, suggest a modulatory role of corticothalamic afferents upon the primate ventral motor thalamus.",C1V1; ChR2; motor cortex; motor thalamus; optogenetics; single unit recording; MACACA-MULATTA THALAMUS; BASAL GANGLIA; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR; RETICULAR NUCLEUS; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; CORTICAL AREAS; FINE-STRUCTURE; RELAY NUCLEI

The Papez circuit, which is composed of the hippocampus, mammillary body and anterior thalamic nuclei, was first proposed to be critical for memory. However, subsequently, the roles of the neural circuit consisting of the rhinal/parahippocampal cortices and the mediodorsal thalamic nuclei became evident. The ventral lateral nuclei or its adjacent structures have been found to be involved in semantic processing, but the specific neural circuits dedicated to language functions have not been identified. Anterior thalamic infarcts, which affect very circumscribed regions of the ventral anterior portion of the thalamus, often cause paradoxically prominent memory and language deficits. We conducted tractography analyses in 6 patients with left anterior thalamic infarcts to identify neural connections or circuits in which disruptions are associated with memory and language deficits in this condition. The current study demonstrated that the mammillothalamic tract, which connects the mammillary body with the anterior thalamic nuclei, and the anterior and inferior thalamic peduncles, which contain neural fibers that extend from several thalamic nuclei to the anterior temporal, medial temporal and frontal cortices, are disrupted in anterior thalamic infarction. These extensive thalamo-cortical disconnections appear to be due to the dissection of the neural fibers that penetrate the ventral anterior nucleus of the thalamus. Our results suggest the following: (1) amnesia that is associated with anterior thalamic infarction is best interpreted in the context of dual/multiple-system theories of memory/amnesia that posit that multiple neural circuits connecting the anterior and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei with the hippocampus and rhinal/parahippocampal cortices work in concert to support memory function; and (2) the semantic deficits observed in this syndrome may be associated with thalamo-anterior temporal and thalamo-lateral frontal disconnections.

Anterograde and retrograde labeling patterns in the thalamus were charted and individual labeled axons traced in continuous serial sections. Both anterograde and retrograde labeling in the thalamus was extensive, spanning several millimeters mediolaterally and including ventral lateral, ventral anterior, centromedian, and centrolateral nuclei. Paracentral, mediodorsal, lateral posterior, and medial pulvinar nuclei were also labeled. Two basic types of corticothalamic axons were identified: small to medium-width, type 1 axons that formed large terminal fields with small boutons, and thick, type 2 axons that formed small terminal fields with large boutons. Within each group, subtypes were identified based on specific features of the axons and terminals: two subtypes of type 1 axons and four subtypes of type 2 axons. The results revealed multiple modes of corticothalamic connectivity: sparsely distributed type I axons, dense plexuses of type 1 axons, type 2 axon terminal fields either singly or in clusters, and mixed plexuses of type 1 and type 2 axons. Only some cells in the plexuses were retrogradely labeled; some plexuses did not contain any labeled neurons, and many retrogradely labeled neurons were in the regions devoid of anterograde labeling. These connectivity patterns differed between thalamic nuclei. The results revealed much more complex relationships between M1 and thalamus than were previously thought to exist. It is suggested that this connectivity is neither of exclusively a feedback nature nor perfectly reciprocal but is subserved by a multitude of channels, most likely originating from different populations of cortical neurons, and feeding into a variety of functionally different neuronal networks, with each processing specific information.

(1990). HRP was injected into various regions of the cortex in different animals and hemispheres (see Fig. 1), and plots were made of the retrogradely stained thalamic projection neurons. The thalamocortical projection is virtually identical in both rodent species. It is topological throughout in that nearby cortical injections label nearby, though overlapping cell groups in the thalamus. Cortical injections in a rostro-caudal progression labelled thalamic projection zones on top of each other, layered like tiles on a roof or fish scales, beginning in the rostromedial and ending in the caudo-dorsal thalamus. The progression vector of thalamic zones projecting successively from more rostral to more caudal cortical zones is twisted and turns from a predominantly mediolateral direction in the anterior thalamus to an essentially ventro-dorsal direction in the posterior thalamus (Figs. 8 and 9). In the marmoset, the thalamo-cortical topography follows the same topological rule, with the exception of the lateral geniculate body which is translocated latero-ventrally and separated from the rest of the thalamus as in all primates. This suggests a general thalamo-cortical mapping rule common to all mammals which can be related to gradients and timing of cell birth in the thalamus. It is proposed that this mapping rule is the consequence of successive appositions of neurons in the medio-ventral thalamus during ontogenetic development.",THALAMOCORTICAL TOPOGRAPHY; TOPOLOGICAL ORGANIZATION; MARMOSET; COMPARATIVE ANATOMY; RODENTS; RETROGRADE AXONAL-TRANSPORT; THALAMO-CORTICAL PROJECTION; POSTERIOR-PULVINAR COMPLEX; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; VISUAL-CORTEX; LATERAL GENICULATE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; FRONTAL-LOBE; MOTOR CORTEX

Interactions between the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) and different parts of the prefrontal cortex are essential in cognitive processes, such as learning and adaptive decision-making. Cortico-thalamocortical interactions involving other dorsal thalamic nuclei, including the anterior thalamus and pulvinar, also influence these cognitive processes. Our work, and that of others, indicates a crucial influence of these interdependent cortico-thalamocortical neural networks that contributes actively to the processing of information within the cortex. Each of these thalamic nuclei also receives potent subcortical inputs that are likely to provide additional influences on their regulation of cortical activity. Here, we highlight our current neuroscientific research aimed at establishing when cortico-MD thalamocortical neural network communication is vital within the context of a rapid learning and memory discrimination task. We are collecting evidence of MD-prefrontal cortex neural network communication in awake, behaving male rhesus macaques. Given the prevailing evidence, further studies are needed to identify both broad and specific mechanisms that govern how the MD, anterior thalamus and pulvinar cortico-thalamocortical interactions support learning, memory and decision-making. Current evidence shows that the MD (and the anterior thalamus) are crucial for frontotemporal communication, and the pulvinar is crucial for frontoparietal communication. Such work is crucial to advance our understanding of the neuroanatomical and physiological bases of these brain functions in humans. In turn, this might offer avenues to develop effective treatment strategies to improve the cognitive deficits often observed in many debilitating neurological disorders and diseases and in neurodegeneration.",anterior thalamus; behaviour; decision making; mediodorsal thalamus; neuroimaging; neurophysiology; prefrontal cortex; pulvinar; MEDIODORSAL THALAMIC NUCLEUS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PULVINAR INACTIVATION; MACAQUE MONKEYS; MEDIAL THALAMUS; LESIONS; AMYGDALA; PROJECTIONS; SELECTION; DISCONNECTION

The posterolateral thalamus is the relay station for ipsi- and contralateral ascending vestibular input to the multiple multisensory vestibular cortex areas. The aim of this study was to evaluate the differential effects of unilateral vestibular thalamic lesions on thalamo-cortical projections, right hemispheric dominance and reciprocal inhibitory visual-vestibular interaction, as well as perceptual and ocular motor consequences during caloric irrigation. The major findings of the group analyses of the patients with right-sided and those with left-sided lesions were as follows: (i) activation of the multisensory vestibular temporo-parietal cortex was significantly reduced in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the thalamic lesion when the ipsilesional or contralesional ear was stimulated; (ii) activation of multisensory vestibular cortex areas of the hemisphere contralateral to the irrigated ipsilesional ear was also diminished; and (iii) the right hemispheric dominance in right-handers described above was preserved in those with right and left thalamic lesions. Simultaneous deactivations were often restricted to only one hemisphere-the one contralateral to the stimulation and contralateral to the vestibular cortex areas activated. There was, however, one area in the inferior insula which was also activated by either right or left ear stimulation in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the lesion. This supports the assumption that there is a bilateral direct ascending vestibular projection from the vestibular nuclei to the inferior part of the insula, which bypasses the posterolateral thalamus and is stronger in the right hemisphere. The cortical asymmetry of the pattern of activation during horizontal semicircular canal stimulation by calorics was not associated with a significant direction-specific asymmetry of caloric nystagmus or perceived body motion. Thus, the data demonstrate the functional importance of the posterolateral thalamus as a unique relay station for vestibular input to the cortex, of the dominance of the right hemisphere in right-handedness, and of ipsilateral ascending pathways. Furthermore, the normal interaction between the two sensory systems-the vestibular and the visual-appears to be impaired.",vestibular system; thalamic lesion; PET; imaging; thalamo-cortical system; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; MONKEYS MACACA-FASCICULARIS; FUNCTIONAL BRAIN IMAGES; RHESUS-MONKEY; MACAQUE MONKEY; OPTOKINETIC STIMULATION; CALORIC STIMULATION; HEMISPHERIC DOMINANCE; GALVANIC STIMULATION; CORTICAL PROJECTION

Glutamatergic inputs to these cells arise predominantly from corticothalamic (in both basal ganglia- and cerebellar-receiving ventral motor thalamic territories; BGMT and CBMT, respectively) and cerebellothalamic terminals (in CBMT). In Parkinson's disease patients and animal models, neuronal activity is abnormal within both BGMT and CBMT. Historically, such motor thalamic dysregulation has been largely attributed to changes in inhibitory tone from the basal ganglia output nuclei, ignoring the potential role of other thalamic inputs in such processes, particularly within the CBMT, which is largely devoid of direct basal ganglia afferents. We have recently reported changes in the abundance and structural morphology of corticothalamic terminals in BGMT of parkinsonian monkeys. In this study, we assessed potential changes in the prevalence of cortical (vesicular glutamate transporter 1-positive, vGluT1-positive) and subcortical (vGluT2-positive) glutamatergic inputs in contact with GABAergic interneurons in BGMT and CBMT of MPTP-treated parkinsonian monkeys. Our findings revealed that interneurons represent a major target of both sets of glutamatergic terminals. In both BGMT and CBMT of control and parkinsonian monkeys, 29%-38% of total asymmetric axodendritic synapses (putative glutamatergic) were formed by vGluT1-positive terminals and 11%-17% of total vGluT1-positive terminals targeted dendrites of GABAergic interneurons. In CBMT, 16%-18% of asymmetric synaptic inputs on interneurons involved vGluT2-containing terminals. No major differences in the extent of glutamatergic innervation of thalamic GABAergic interneurons were found between control and parkinsonian monkeys.",cerebellothalamic; corticothalamic; Parkinson's disease; primate; thalamic interneurons; ventral motor thalamus; DORSAL LATERAL GENICULATE; MACACA-MULATTA THALAMUS; FINE-STRUCTURE; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; IMMUNOREACTIVE INTERNEURONS; MAGNOCELLULAR SUBDIVISION; RETINAL TERMINALS; NUCLEUS VAMC; CELL-TYPES; INNERVATION

We explored the neuroanatomic distribution of ERK immunoreactivity in the rhesus monkey brain. The hippocampal formation, especially the messy fiber zone and the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus are the most heavily immunostained areas. Cerebral cortex is, in general, more intensely stained in the supragranular layers.

Retrograde tracing studies revealed that whisker-related VL neurons were found relatively anterior and medial to those labeled following injection of retrograde tracer into hindpaw motor areas. Simultaneous injections of fluorescent microspheres in both cortical regions did not result in double-labeled neurons in VL. Quantitative analysis of dendritic and somatic morphologies did not reveal any differences between hindpaw and whisker thalamocortical neurons within VL. The morphology of the thalamocortical neurons within mouse VL is similar to those in other mammals and suggests that mouse can be used as a model system for studying thalamocortical transformations within the motor system as well as plasticity following sensory deprivation or enrichment.</.",thalamus; ventral lateral thalamus; whiskers; somatotopy; PRIMATE MOTOR THALAMUS; PROJECTION NEURONS; MACAQUE MONKEY; CORTEX; RAT; INPUT; NUCLEUS; CAT; CONNECTIONS; PREMOTOR

We investigated the connections of the PM with the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in macaque monkeys, with tracers placed into the PM and the PFC, respectively. Injections of wheat germ agglutinin horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) placed into the PM resulted in widespread anterograde terminal labeling in layers III and IV and retrograde cellular labeling in layer VI of the PFC. Injections of tracers centered on the central/lateral PM resulted in labeling of dorsolateral and orbital regions, whereas injections centered on caudal, medial PM resulted in labeling of dorsomedial and medial PFC. Since injections of the PM included neighboring thalamic nuclei, retrograde tracers were placed into distinct cytoarchitectonic regions of the PFC and retrogradely labeled cells in the posterior thalamus were charted. The results of this series of tracer injections confirmed the results of the thalamic injections. Injections placed into areas 8a, 12 (lateral and orbital), 45, 46 and 11, retrogradely labeled neurons in the central/lateral PM, while tracer injections placed into areas 9, 12 (lateral), 10 and 24, labeled medial PM. The connections of the PM with temporal, parietal, insular, and cingulate cortices were also examined. The central/lateral PM has reciprocal connections with posterior parietal areas 7a, 7ip, and 7b, insular cortex, caudal superior temporal sulcus (STS), caudal superior temporal gyrus (STG), and posterior cingulate, whereas medial PM is connected mainly with the anterior STS and STG, as well as the cingulate cortex and the amygdala. These connectional studies suggest that the central/lateral and medial PM have divergent connections which may be the substrate for distinct functional circuits.

These cortical subpopulations display different axonal outgrowth kinetics and innervate distinct thalamic nuclei in a temporal pattern determined by cortical layer identity and subclass specificity. Guidance by molecular cues, structural cues, and activity-dependent mechanisms contribute to this development. There is a substantial rearrangement of the corticofugal connectivity outside the thalamus at the border of and within the reticular thalamic nucleus, a region that shares some of the characteristics of the cortical subplate during development. The early transient circuits are not well understood, nor the extent to which this developmental pattern may be driven by peripheral sensory activity.

Detailed anatomy and functional connectivity patterns of the thalamocortical system are essential to understanding the cortical organization and pathophysiology of a wide range of thalamus-related neurological and neuropsychiatric diseases. The current study used resting-state fMRI to investigate the topography of the human thalamocortical system from a functional perspective. The thalamus-related cortical networks were identified by performing independent component analysis on voxel-based thalamic functional connectivity maps across a large group of subjects. The resulting functional brain networks were very similar to well-established resting-state network maps. Using these brain network components in a spatial regression model with each thalamic voxel's functional connectivity map, we localized the thalamic subdivisions related to each brain network. For instance, the medial dorsal nucleus was shown to be associated with the default mode, the bilateral executive, the medial visual networks; and the pulvinar nucleus was involved in both the dorsal attention and the visual networks. These results revealed that a single nucleus may have functional connections with multiple cortical regions or even multiple functional networks, and may be potentially related to the function of mediation or modulation of multiple cortical networks. This observed organization of thalamocortical system provided a reference for studying the functions of thalamic sub-regions.

Thalamocortical neurons in most of these nuclei are modulated by the affective and cognitive signals which funnel through the basal ganglia. We review how PFC-connected thalamic nuclei likely contribute to all aspects of cognitive control: from the processing of information on internal states and goals, facilitating its interactions with mnemonic information and learned values of stimuli and actions, to their influence on high-level cognitive processes, attentional allocation and goaldirected behavior. This includes contributions to transformations such as rule-to-choice (parvocellular mediodorsal nucleus), value-to-choice (magnocellular mediodorsal nucleus), mnemonic-to-choice (anteromedial nucleus) and sensory-to-choice (medial pulvinar). Common mechanisms appear to be thalamic modulation of cortical gain and cortico-cortical functional connectivity. The anatomy also implies a unique role for medial PFC in modulating processing in thalamocortical circuits involving other orbital and lateral PFC regions.

However, there is yet little understanding of changes in thalamic connectivity during exposure to aversive sensory inputs in individuals with ASD. In particular, the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus is implicated in atypical sensory processing given its role in selective attention, regulation, and sensory integration. This study aimed to examine the role of pulvinar connectivity in ASD during mildly aversive sensory input. Functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to examine connectivity with the pulvinar during exposure to mildly aversive auditory and tactile stimuli in 38 youth (age 9-17; 19 ASD, 19 IQ-matched typically developing (TD)). Parents rated children's SOR severity on two standard scales. Compared to TD, ASD participants displayed aberrant modulation of connectivity between pulvinar and cortex (including sensory-motor and prefrontal regions) during sensory stimulation. In ASD participants, pulvinar-amygdala connectivity was correlated with severity of SOR symptoms. Deficits in modulation of thalamocortical connectivity in youth with ASD may reflect reduced thalamo-cortical inhibition in response to sensory stimulation, which could lead to difficulty filtering out and/or integrating sensory information. An increase in amygdala connectivity with the pulvinar might be partially responsible for deficits in selective attention as the amygdala signals the brain to attend to distracting sensory stimuli.

MMN is thought to represent a comparison of the features of the present stimulus versus a mnemonic template formed by the prior stimuli. METHODS: We used concurrent thalamic and primary auditory cortical (A1) laminar recordings in 7 macaques to evaluate the relative contributions of core (lemniscal) and matrix (nonlemniscal) thalamic afferents to MMN generation. RESULTS: We demonstrated that deviance-related activity is observed mainly in matrix regions of auditory thalamus, MMN generators are most prominent in layer 1 of cortex as opposed to sensory responses that activate layer 4 first and sequentially all cortical layers, and MMN is elicited independent of the frequency tuning of A1 neuronal ensembles. Consistent with prior reports, MMN-related thalamocortical activity was strongly inhibited by ketamine.

However, injections in the motor area resulted in retrograde and anterograde labelling of nuclei in both the ipsilateral and contralateral thalamus. These nuclei included the ventral lateral nucleus (VL), the intralaminar nuclei (ILN), the mediodorsal nucleus (MD) and midline nuclei. Large unilateral injections located mainly laterally in the thalamus labelled cells, contralaterally, in the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus, the intergeniculate leaflet and the reticular nucleus of the thalamus but never in VL, ILN and MD.

Methods: Thirty minutes before intraperitoneal induction of SE by Coriaria lactone (CL), rhesus monkeys were treated with LEV (15 or 150 mg/kg) delivered intravenously as a single bolus. CL dose and epileptic behavior were recorded. Electroencephalography (EEG) was performed before and during the experiment. All rhesus monkeys were killed after 1-month video monitoring and processed for pathological investigation of neuronal injury, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling (TUNEL) staining, and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) staining. Results: No animal exhibited spontaneous seizures during 1-month video monitoring. Development of acute SE was significantly inhibited in the group given 150 mg/kg LEV, compared with controls and the 15 mg/kg LEV group. Delayed latency, reduction of SE duration, decreased cumulative time of tonic convulsions, slight severity of SE, and a high CL induction dose were observed in the high LEV dose group (p < 0.05). The EEG showed less frequent epileptic discharges in the group administered with 150 mg/kg LEV. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining, ultrastructural examination, TUNEL and GFAP staining revealed serious damage, including neuron loss, swollen mitochondrion, and strong positivity for TUNEL in the hippocampus and thalamus of controls, whereas moderate damage in the group administered with 15 mg/kg LEV, and very mild damage in the 150 mg/kg LEV group. Gliosis was found in the hippocampus of controls, not in the LEV groups and normal rhesus monkey.

In three macaque monkeys (Macaca fascicularis), we observed up to five finger-like protrusions that emanated from the posterior pole of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and extended posteriorly between the lateral pulvinar and reticular nucleus of the thalamus. These anomalous fingers measured up to 1.7 mm in length and contained dense accumulations of neurons and glia. The fingers received a direct retinal input from the contralateral eye indicating that they were part of the LGN rather than of other adjacent thalamic nuclei. In order to determine with which subcompartment(s) of the LGN the fingers were associated (parvocellular, magnocellular, or intercalated layers), we examined the immunochemical properties and size of neurons in the fingers and LGN subcompartments. We concluded that the fingers were not associated with the intercalated layers, since neurons in the fingers did not stain with an antibody to calbindin-D28k, whereas intercalated neurons stained intensely with this antibody. In addition, neurons located in the fingers were significantly smaller than those found in the magnocellular layers but were not significantly different in size from neurons in the parvocellular layers. We therefore consider that the fingers are an anomaly of the parvocellular subcompartment of the LGN. Interestingly, in two of the three cases with anomalous fingers, we also observed subsidiary parvocellular laminae, suggesting that these two anomalies were related. In five additional animals, however, we observed subsidiary parvocellular laminae without anomalous fingers. Thus, if there are common mechanisms underlying the development of both anomalous fingers and subsidiary layers, our data indicate that they do not always result in the concomitant expression of both anomalies.","thalamus; lamination; retinal projections; (primates) monkey, Macaca fascicularis; CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEINS; MONOCULAR ENUCLEATION; RETINAL PROJECTIONS; PULVINAR NUCLEUS; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; MACAQUE MONKEYS; RHESUS-MONKEY; VISUAL-SYSTEM; PATTERNS; IMMUNOREACTIVITY"

Here we demonstrate temporally induced elevation of visual responsiveness in cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of cat and monkey following a period of high intensity (elevated contrast) stimulation. This augmentation is seen in 40-70% (monkey-cat) of cells tested and of all subtypes. Peaking at similar to 3 min following the period of intense stimulation, it can last for 10-12 min and can be repeated and summed in time. Furthermore, it is dependent on corticofugal input, is seen even when high contrast stimuli of orthogonal orientation are used and therefore results from a/any prior increase in activity in the retino-geniculo-striate pathway. We suggest that this reflects a general mechanism for control of visual responsiveness; both a flexible and dynamic means of changing effectiveness of thalamic activity as visual input changes, but also a mechanism which is an emergent property of the thalamo-cortico-thalamic loop.",context dependent; contrast mediated; cortico-geniculate; response enhancement; thalamo-cortico-thalamic loop; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; METABOTROPIC GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; RABBIT FOLLOWING STIMULATION; SYNAPTIC TRANSMISSION; AUGMENTING RESPONSES; LASTING POTENTIATION; PERFORANT PATH; DENTATE AREA; CORTEX

Area 46 has complex connections with somatosensory, visual, visuomotor, motor, and limbic systems and a key role in cognition, which frequently declines with age. An important question is what alterations might account for this decline. We are nowhere near having a complete answer, but as will be shown in this review, it is now evident that there is no single underlying cause. There is no significant loss of cortical neurons and although there are a few senile plaques in rhesus monkey cortex, their frequency does not correlate with cognitive decline. However, as discussed in this review, the following do correlate with cognitive decline. Loss of white matter has been proposed to result in some disconnections between parts of the central nervous system and changes in the structure of myelin sheaths reduce conduction velocity and the timing in neuronal circuits. In addition, there are reductions in the inputs to cortical neurons, as shown by regression of dendritic trees, loss of dendritic spines and synapses, and alterations in transmitters and receptors. These factors contribute to alterations in the intrinsic and network physiological properties of cortical neurons. As more details emerge, it is to be hoped that effective interventions to retard cognitive decline can be proposed. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

This is a problem when thalamic stereotaxy is again being use clinically. The cause usually imputed is the historical conflict between two main schools, the Vogt and the 'Anglo-American' (Michigan), which used different nomenclatures. In fact, the reasons are more profound and serious. A combination of them led to: an archaic, rigid conception of the 'thalamic nucleus'; overexploitation of cytoarchitectonic technique, comparative anatomy and cortical connections; under exploitation of subcortical afferent territories; recent misuse of these territories, hesitations in the use of the VA-VL system; and opposition between ventral ('relay') and dorsal ('associative') 'nuclei'. Previous and current parcellations and nomenclatures for the lateral region finally appeared inappropriate. Before presenting a new parcellation and nomenclature for the lateral region, we explain why we did not adopt one of most common or of recently proposed nomenclatures, and were led to make our own. This is established according to rational and historically grounded rules. Precise definition of thalamic elements is provided. A thalamic 'region' is a gross topographic division corresponding to the former nuclei. A 'territory' is defined as the cerebral space filled by afferent endings from one source. When having a distinct topography in a region, a given territory makes a 'subregion'. For each of the studied 'motor' territories a review was made of its known cortical projections. The thalamic space where neurons project to a given cortical target constitutes a 'source space'. Topographical comparison of the sources spaces with territories reveals that there is often no coincidence between different (afferent or efferent) neuronal set spaces. It appears that source spaces are coincident in the pallidal and nigral territories but not in the cerebellar territory where two topographically distinct source spaces could be distinguished. A 'thalamic nucleus' is defined as the intersection of a thalamocortical source space with one territory. A rapid review of the general anatomy of the diencephalon is made. The ('dorsal') thalamus is divided into 'allo-' and 'isothalamus', the latter with 'bushy' and 'microneurons'. The lateral region is isothalamic. The 'motor thalamus' makes the anterior part of the lateral region. The present work aims to analyse the functional anatomy of the 'motor thalamus' by using precise topography and three-dimensional analysis of the subcortical territories receiving from the cerebellar nuclei (part II), the medial nucleus of the pallidum (part III) and the pars reticulata and mixta of the substantia nigra (part IV). Large injections were used to obtain the maximal extent of each territory. A major deficiency of previous studies was inadequate cartography. Reliance on ventricular (CA-CP) landmarks observed by use of orthogonal teleradiography is mandatory. A study was made of intra- and interspecific variations and their effect on stereotactic and cartographic precision in macaques. All three subcortical motor afferent territories to the motor thalamus of macaques are examined in precise cartography with three dimensional reconstructions, rotations and 'reslicing'. The motor thalamus is made up of three topographically distinct and separate territories: cerebellar, pallidal territory and nigral. They cover the entire anterior part of the lateral region. There is no polar subdivision without lower afferents in front of the pallidal and nigral territories and thus no reason for isolating a nucleus lateralis polaris or a polar VA. The cerebellar territory is continuous and dense, in front of the somesthetic nucleus and everywhere separate from it. It has a complex three-dimensional shape, strongly convex anteriorly. Its caudal portion is dorsal to the somesthetic nucleus. In the lateral dimension it extends from the lateral region to the paralaminar region of the medial complex. The cerebellar territory, primarily dentate, also contains islands of axons from the interposed and fastigial nuclei, the vestibular nuclei and the spinothalamic tract. It corresponds to at least five previously isolated 'cytoarchitectonic nuclei'. It cannot be seen as a single entity but contains distinct ventrolateral and a mediodorsal source spaces. Its complex three-dimensional shape, its particular intersection with different cytoarchitectonic nuclei and source spaces, can be simplified into two nuclei: nucleus lateralis intermedius lateralis (LIL) and nucleus intermedius mediodorsalis (LIM). The stereotacticians' ventralis intermedius (Vim) is discussed at length. Tremorosynchronous and kinesthetic neurons are essentially located ventrally and laterally. The intrathalamic topography observed in human patients indicates that the stereotacticians's target (where tremorosynchronous neurons are found) is within lateral cerebellar territory receiving cerebellar afferents and projecting to the motor cortex. The hypothesis that the nucleus interpositus could be particularly involved is presented. The nucleus lateralis intermedius lateralis (LIL) of the present study is equivalent in macaques to the stereotacticians' 'V.im.e', object to interspecific differences. The pallidal territory is anterior to and separate from the cerebellar territory, in the oral part of the lateral region. It covers the whole ventrodorsal extent of the thalamus. It is crescent shaped, strongly curved in the anteroposterior dimension, and ends dorsally over the cerebellar territory. It is also curved in the mediolateral dimension following the lateral border of the thalamus. The territorial border does not coincide with cytoarchitectonic borders. The pallidal territory includes various cytoarchitectonic nuclei. Only the cloud-like ventral oral part is easily recognizable on purely cytoarchitectonic criteria. The others are cytoarchitectonically ill defined. The pallidal territory may be delineated using calbindin immunostaining. Other targets of the medial pallidum are the central (centre-median-parafascicular) complex, the pedunculo-pontine complex and the lateral habenula. In relation to its afferent and efferent connections, the pallidal thalamus seems to be made up of a single piece and could be considered as the lateral oral subregion or nucleus (LO). The nigrothalamic connection has been ignored for a long time and remains undervalued. Precise topographic description shows that the nigral territory is much more extensive than usually thought. It is located medial to the pallidal territory, and as the most rostral of all three subcortical afferent territories, is named nucleus lateralis rostralis (LR). Orally the nigral territory covers the whole ventrodorsal extent of the lateral region of the thalamus. A posterior part ends ventrally and medially just in front of the central complex. A topographically distinct amygdalar forms a subdivision named nucleus Lateralis Rostralis pars medialis (LRM). A posterodorsal part ends in the anterior paralaminar part of the medial complex, in front of the cerebellar territory. Islands of nigral terminations are observed within the medial nucleus. Three dimensional studies and artificial reslicing shows a posteroanterior sequence of the lemniscal, cerebellar, pallidal and nigral territories. The three motor territories extend over the whole ventrodorsal extent of the dorsal region. There appears to be no opposition of ventral to dorsal nuclei. Nuclei of the lateral region are thus given the first adjective Lateralis. The second adjective is from the initial sequence devisted by C. Vogt, caudalis-intermedia-oralis, to which we add rostralis. The lemniscal territory is named subregio Lateralis Caudalis with two parts: nucleus Laeralis Caudalis Lateralis (LCL) and nucleus Laeralis Caudalis Medialis (LCM). The cerebellar territory is named subregio Lateralis Intermedia with two nuclei: nucleus Laterlis Intermedius Lateralis (LIL), which is the main source to the motor cortex, and nucleus Lateralis Intremedius Medialis (LIM). The pallidal territory is subregio or nucleus Lateralis Oralis (LO). The nigral territory is subregio or nucleus Lateralis Rostralis (LR) with a paricular pars made by the amygdalar coterritory (LRM). An atlas of the macaque motor thalamus, comprising twelve levels, is presented, with mean dimensions for Macaca mulatta. Boundaries are not primarily cytoarchitectonic but topographic territories and sources spaces. This produces a modified parcellation of the macaque thalamus. Each level is described and compared to Olszewski's equivalent level. The new atlas can be used confidently for stereotactic purpose in macaques of various species.",primate; motor system; cerebellum; basal ganglia; thalamus; SINGLE-UNIT ANALYSIS; POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; THALAMOCORTICAL PROJECTION NEURONS; VENTRAL SPINOTHALAMIC PATHWAYS; MEDIAN-PARAFASCICULAR COMPLEX; MONKEY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; SUPPLEMENTARY EYE FIELD; SOMATIC SENSORY CORTEX; DORSAL COLUMN NUCLEI

This study attempts to identify the correlation between thalamic relay cells and functional activity evoked in the ventroposterior nucleus (VP) of cynomolgus and squirrel monkeys. Wheatgerm agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA:HRP) was iontophoretically injected into physiologically determined sites in the somatosensory cortex, resulting in retrogradely labeled cells and anterogradely labeled terminals in corresponding somatosensory thalamic regions. In the same animals, 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) experiments were carried out 2 days later, using the somatic stimuli identified as best exciting the cortical neurons. Stimulation to the limbs produced crescent-shaped clusters of metabolic label arranged in a somatotopically organized fashion in the ventral posterior lateral nucleus (VPL). Following WGA:HRP injections into area 3b, the stimulus-evoked 2DG label was colocalized with the retrograde and anterograde tracer. This finding suggests that the location of stimulus-evoked metabolic activity can be predicted by the presence of transported WGA:HRP clusters.",SOMATOSENSORY THALAMUS; WGA-HRP; 2-DEOXYGLUCOSE; CYTOCHROME OXIDASE; THALAMIC ROD; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; VENTROBASAL COMPLEX; SAIMIRI-SCIUREUS; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; THALAMUS; HISTOCHEMISTRY; ORGANIZATION; PROJECTION; MACAQUE

In this paper this issue is addressed by investigating the connectivity pattern of a brain structure with many, well characterized structural connections, namely the thalamus. Diffusion-weighted and resting state (RS) functional MRI (fMRI) data were collected in a group of 38 healthy participants. Probabilistic tractography was performed to parcellate the thalamus into regions structurally connected to different cortical areas. The resulting regions were used as seeds for seed-based analysis of RS fMRI data. The tractographic parcellation was thus cross-validated against functional connectivity data by evaluating the overlap between the functional and structural thalamo-cortical connections originating from the parcellated regions. Our data show only a partial overall correspondence between structural and functional connections, in the same group of healthy individuals, thus suggesting that the two approaches provide complementary and not overlapping information. Future studies are warranted to extend the results we obtained in the thalamus to other structures, and to confirm that the mechanisms behind functional connectivity are more complex than just expressing structural connectivity.",Resting-state fMRI; Tractography; Diffusion; Thalamo-cortical connections; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL SULCUS; CORTICOTHALAMIC CONNECTIONS; RHESUS-MONKEY; BASAL GANGLIA; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; NETWORKS; MRI; SEGMENTATION; ORGANIZATION; PARALLEL

Neurosurgeons mostly use the stereotactic atlas of Schaltenbrand with Hassler's nomenclature of the thalamus. Neuroanatomists use different nomenclatures for the primate thalamus. The cytoarchitectonic definition of nuclei is difficult in the motor thalamus. and it would be best to define the nuclei based on their subcortical afferents. However, tracing studies are not available in humans. Thus, human thalamic nomenclature is based entirely on cytoarchitectonic subdivisions and transfer of knowledge by analogy from monkey to man. Problems arise when trying to transfer the detailed knowledge from monkey to the human brain. By doing so, different authors have come to different conclusions concerning the subcortical afferents of Hassler's motor nuclei, which inevitably leads to confusion when attempting neurophysiological interpretations of the surgical data. The present review draws attention to the discrepancies and open questions in the literature. There is a need to better define the limits of the sensory and cerebellar afferent receiving thalamic nuclei as well as those of the cerebellar and pallidal afferent receiving territories in humans.

After tracer injections in the mediodorsal nuclei on either side, neurons were retrogradely labeled in all the areas of the contralateral prefrontal cortex in which ipsilateral labeling was also observed. Contralateral corticothalamic cells accounted for 15% of the labeled neurons in the orbital and agranular insular areas, while their proportion was lower (3%) in the anterior cingulate cortex. Up to 70% of the contralateral cortical neurons were double labeled by bilateral injections in the mediodorsal nuclei. At the electron microscopic level, unilateral injections of biotinylated dextran-amine in the orbitofrontal cortex resulted in anterograde labeling of small terminals and a few large boutons in the ipsilateral mediodorsal nucleus, while only small boutons were identified contralaterally. The diameter of postsynaptic dendritic profiles contacted by labeled small cortical endings was significantly larger in the ipsilateral mediodorsal nucleus than contralaterally. These findings demonstrate that dense contralateral cortical projections to the mediodorsal nucleus derive from the orbital and agranular insular areas, and that crossed corticothalamic afferents are mostly formed by collaterals of the ipsilateral connections. Our observations also point out the heterogeneity of corticothalamic boutons in the rat mediodorsal nucleus and morphological differences in the synaptic organization of prefrontal fibers innervating the two sides, indicating that ipsilateral cortical afferents may be more proximally distributed than crossed cortical fibers on dendrites of mediodorsal neurons.

The results indicate that corticothalamic connections of the STS in general reciprocate thalamocortical connections. The cortex of the upper bank of the STS-multimodal areas TPO and PGa-projects to four major thalamic targets: the pulvinar complex, the mediodorsal nucleus, the limitans-suprageniculate nucleus, as well as intralaminar nuclei. Within the pulvinar complex, the main projections of the upper bank of the STS are directed to the medial pulvinar (PM) nucleus. Rostral upper bank regions tend to project caudally and medially within the PM nucleus, caudal upper bank regions, more laterally and ventrally. The mid-portion of the upper bank tends to occupy the central sector of the PM nucleus. There are also relatively minor projections from upper bank regions to the lateral pulvinar (PL) and oral pulvinar (PO) nuclei. In contrast to the upper bank, the projections from the lower bank are directed primarily to the pulvinar complex, with only minor projections to intralaminar nuclei. The rostral portion of the lower bank projects mainly to caudal and medial regions of the PM nucleus, whereas the caudal lower bank projects predominantly to the lateral PM nucleus, and also to the PL, PO, and inferior pulvinar (PI) nuclei. The mid-portion of the lower bank projects mainly to central and lateral portions of the PM nucleus, and also to the PI and PL nuclei. The rostral depth of the STS projects mainly to the PM nucleus, with only minor connections to the PO, PI, and PL nuclei. The mid-portion of multimodal area TPO of the upper bank, areas TPO2 and TPO3, projects preferentially to the central sector of the PM nucleus.

We used the Collation of Connectivity Data on the Macaque Brain (CoCoMac) and calculated the degree distributions, transmission coefficients, connection density, clustering coefficients, path lengths, and modularity. Our results showed that the TCL and cortex exhibit exponential degree distributions, and the ratio of efferent/afferent connections in the thalamus is smaller than 1.0 This may support the notion that the connections received by the thalamus from the cortex play a key role in improving information processing in the conscious states. The average values of transmission coefficients for the cortex and TCL were found to be equal to 1.49 and 1.28, respectively. This indicates that: (i) the cortex is a system that mainly transmits information outward rather than receives it; (ii) the TCL is a cooperative system that performs this in a give-and-take manner; (iii) connections of the cortex are denser than those in the TCL, showing that the cortex might be advantageous for processing of complicated information during consciousness; (iv) both the TCL and cortex are small-world systems; (v) the scaled value of the characteristic path length in the TCL is smaller than that in the cortex, which implies a higher speed potential for information processing in the TCL than in the cortex; (vi) the scaled value of the clustering coefficient is nearly the same in the cortex and TCL, and (vii) the number of modules is 5 in the cortex and 6 in the TCL.",clustering coefficient; characteristic path length; transmission coefficient; modularity; small-world; brain networks; SMALL-WORLD; ORGANIZATION; BRAIN

This study aimed to investigate the functional connectivity of the thalamus in youth with ADHD, using both anatomically and functionally defined thalamic seed regions. Methods:Resting-state functional MRIs obtained from the publicly available ADHD-200 database were analyzed. Thalamic seed regions were defined functionally and anatomically based on Yeo's 7 resting-state-network parcellation atlas and the AAL3 atlas, respectively. Functional connectivity maps of the thalamus were extracted, and thalamocortical functional connectivity was compared between youth with and without ADHD. Results:Using the functionally defined seeds, significant group differences in thalamocortical functional connectivity and significant negative correlations between thalamocortical connectivity and ADHD symptom severity were observed within the boundaries of corresponding large-scale networks. However, in the analysis using the anatomically defined thalamic seeds, significant group differences in connectivity and significant positive correlations were observed outside the expected boundaries of major anatomic projections. The thalamocortical connectivity originating from the lateral geniculate nuclei of the thalamus was significantly correlated with age in youth with ADHD. Limitations:The small sample size and smaller proportion of girls were limiting factors. Conclusion:Thalamocortical functional connectivity based on the intrinsic network architecture of the brain appears to be clinically relevant in ADHD. The positive association between thalamocortical functional connectivity and ADHD symptom severity may represent a compensatory process recruiting an alternative neural network.",nan; DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; BASAL GANGLIA; ORGANIZATION; THALAMUS; COMPENSATION; NETWORKS; NUCLEUS

According to Hassler, this area includes ventro-oralis posterior (Vop) and ventral intermedius (Vim) nuclei, although some investigators believe that Vop is associated with the pallidothalamic pathway. We sought to correlate our experimental data on distribution of nigral, pallidal, and cerebellar afferents to the monkey thalamus with Hassler's motor thalamic parcelations. We concluded that Hassler's parcelations retained their value, although some adjustments were needed to relate them to the current neuroanatomic data; particularly, the cerebellothalamic zone that represents the monkey ventral lateral nucleus (VL) corresponds topographically to Hassler's Vop, Vim, and most of Voi. Electron microscopic tracing studies have shown very complex circuitry in this region of the monkey thalamus, as the cerebellar and cortical afferents innervating it are engaged in complex synapses with thalamocortical projection neurons, and this interaction is strongly modulated by local circuit neurons and the input from the reticular thalamic nucleus, which are both inhibitory and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic. Spinothalamic afferents also reach the VL. but this input is less studied in the monkey. The circuitry subserving the activity of thalamocortical projection neurons in the VL should be considered while interpreting the functional data obtained in stereotactic surgery.

Recent work in macaques suggests that the thalamus conveys corollary discharge information of upcoming saccades passing from the superior colliculus to the frontal eye field. The present study aimed to investigate the involvement of the thalamus in humans by assessing the effect of thalamic lesions on the processing of corollary discharge information. Thirteen patients with selective thalamic lesions and 13 healthy age-matched control subjects performed a saccadic double-step task in which retino-spatial dissonance was induced, i.e. the retinal vector of the second target and the movement vector of the second saccade were different. Thus, the subjects could not rely on retinal information alone, but had to use corollary discharge information to correctly perform the second saccade. The amplitudes of first and second saccades were significantly smaller in patients than in controls. Five thalamic lesion patients showed unilateral deficits in using corollary discharge information, as revealed by asymmetries compared with the other patients and controls. Three patients with lateral thalamic lesions including the ventrolateral nucleus (VL) were impaired contralaterally to the side of damage and one patient with a lesion in the mediodorsal thalamus (MD) was impaired ipsilaterally to the lesion. The largest asymmetry was found in a patient with a bilateral thalamic lesion. The results provide evidence for a thalamic involvement in the processing of corollary discharge information in humans, with a potential role of both the VL and MD nuclei.",saccades; thalamus; FRONTAL EYE FIELD; MONKEY SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; DELAY-PERIOD ACTIVITY; DOUBLE-STEP SACCADES; PARIETAL CORTEX; EFFERENT CONNECTIONS; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; VISUAL SPACE; LESIONS; MOVEMENTS

TrkC-like immunoreactivity was widespread and consisted primarily of varicose fibers. The most dense populations of fibers were in the basal forebrain (in the cholinergic cell groups Ch1, Ch2 and Ch4), in the raphe complex throughout its rostrocaudal extent, and in the locus coeruleus. Other fibers were present in the thalamus, hypothalamus, central gray matter of the midbrain, dorsal midline of the brainstem and the cerebral cortex. The only neuronal cell bodies with consistent labeling were located in the lateral hypothalamus. Purkinje cells in the cerebellum showed variable labeling. Specific labeling of varicosities and cell bodies was abolished by omission of the primary antiserum or by preabsorption with the TrkC peptide antigen. We conclude that TrkC-like immunoreactivity can be detected in a wide variety of subcortical locations in the adult rhesus monkey. Labeling was particularly prominent in the vicinity of the major cholinergic, serotonergic and adrenergic nuclei, known from other studies to be vulnerable in the ageing brain.

Their subunits originate from different genes or gene families. The majority of GABA(A) receptors in the mammalian brain consist of two alpha-, two beta- and one gamma- or delta-subunit. This subunit organization crucially determines the physiological and pharmacological properties of the GABA(A) receptors. Using immunohistochemistry, we investigated the distribution of 10 GABA(A) receptor subunits (alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 4, alpha 5, beta 1, beta 2, beta 3, gamma 2, and delta) in the fore brain of three female rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta). Within the cerebral cortex, subunits alpha 1, alpha 5, beta 2, beta 3, and gamma 2 were found in all layers, alpha 2, alpha 3, and beta 1 were more concentrated in the inner and outer layers. The caudate/putamen was rich in alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 5, all three beta-subunits, gamma 2, and delta. Subunits alpha 3 and alpha 5 were more concentrated in the caudate than in the putamen. In contrast, alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 1, beta 2, gamma 2, and delta were highest in the pallidum. Most dorsal thalamic nuclei contained subunits alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 4, beta 2, beta 3, and gamma 2, whereas alpha 1, alpha 3, beta 1, and gamma 2 were most abundant in the reticular nucleus. Within the amygdala, subunits alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 5, beta 1, beta 3, gamma 2, and delta were concentrated in the cortical nucleus, whereas in the lateral and basolateral amygdala alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 5, beta 1, beta 3, and delta, and in the central amygdala alpha 1, alpha 2, beta 3, and gamma 2 were most abundant. Interestingly, subunit alpha 3-IR outlined the intercalated nuclei of the amygdala. In the hippocampus, subunits alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 5, beta 2, beta 3, gamma 2, and delta were highly expressed in the dentate molecular layer, whereas alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 5, beta 1, beta 2, beta 3, and gamma 2 were concentrated in sector CA1 and the subiculum. The distribution of GABA(A) receptor subunits in the rhesus monkey was highly heterogeneous indicating a high number of differently assembled receptors. In most areas investigated, notably in the striatum/pallidum, amygdaloid nuclei and in the hippocampus it was more diverse than in the rat and mouse indicating a more heterogeneous and less defined receptor assembly in the monkey than in rodent brain.","antibody alpha 1 (BD24); RRID:AB_2108828, ab alpha 2; RRID:AB_2827793, ab alpha 3; RRID:AB_2827797, ab alpha 4; RRID:AB_2827798, ab alpha 5; RRID:AB_2827799, ab beta 1; RRID:AB_2827800, ab beta 2; RRID:AB_2827801, ab beta 3; RRID:AB_2827802, ab gamma 2; RRID:AB_2827803, ab delta; RRID:AB_2827804, ab GAD67; RRID:AB_2278725, ab NeuN; RRID:AB_2278725; amygdala; basal ganglia; benzodiazepine; GABA(A) receptor subunits; goat biotinylated anti-rabbit ab; RRID:AB_2336810; horse anti-mouse ab; RRID:AB_2336811; immunohistochemistry; monkey; primate; thalamus; RAT HIPPOCAMPUS; MESSENGER-RNAS; IMMUNOCYTOCHEMICAL DISTRIBUTION; BASAL GANGLIA; HUMAN BRAIN; EXPRESSION; SUBTYPES; LOCALIZATION; INHIBITION; ACTIVATION"

Here, we demonstrate by combined retrograde tracing and immunocytochemistry that at least some of these are pulvinocortical relay neurons, and further report several distinctive features. First, in contrast with non-giant relay neurons, the giant neurons are often solitary and isolated from a main projection focus. The question thus arises of whether their cortical projections may be non-reciprocal or otherwise distinctive. Second, these neurons are positive for GluR4; but third, they are otherwise neurochemically heterogeneous, in that about one-third are positive for both parvalbumin (PV) and CB. Presumably, these subpopulations are also functionally heterogeneous. These results provide further evidence for the idea of multiple, interleaved organizations within the pulvinar; and they imply that thalamocortical projections are more disparate than has yet been appreciated. Finally, we found that giant CB+ neurons have a distinctive meshwork of large, PV+ terminations, prominent at the first dendritic branch point. In size and location, these resemble inhibitory terminations from the zona incerta or anterior pretectal nucleus (APT), as recently described in higher order thalamic nuclei in rats. One can speculate that giant neurons in the macaque pulvinar participate in a layer 5-APT-thalamus (giant neuron) extrareticular pathway, functionally distinct from the layer 6-reticular nucleus-thalamus network.",anterior pretectal nucleus; calbindin; extrareticular; GluR4; parvalbumin; pulvinocortical relay neurons; thalamocortical; INFERIOR PULVINAR; NEUROCHEMICAL SUBDIVISIONS; VISUAL AREAS; NUCLEUS; ORGANIZATION; PROJECTIONS; CONNECTIONS; THALAMUS; MONKEYS; COMPLEX

Here we report on the distribution of response modalities to 487 intraoperative thalamic stimulations performed in 24 neurogenic pain (NP), 17 parkinsonian (PD) and 10 neuropsychiatric (Npsy) patients. Threshold responses were subdivided into somatosensory, motor and affective, and compared between medial (central lateral nucleus) and lateral (ventral anterior, ventral lateral and ventral medial) thalamic nuclei and between patients groups. Major findings were as follows: in the medial thalamus, evoked responses were for a large majority (95%) somatosensory in NP patients, 47% were motor in PD patients, and 54% affective in Npsy patients. In the lateral thalamus, a much higher proportion of somatosensory (83%) than motor responses (5%) was evoked in NP patients, while the proportion was reversed in PD patients (69% motor vs. 21% somatosensory). These results provide the first evidence for functional cross-modal changes in lateral and medial thalamic nuclei in response to intraoperative stimulations in different functional disorders. This extensive functional reorganization sheds new light on wide-range plasticity in the adult human thalamocortical system. (C) 2009 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Each radiotracer is a propylsulfonamide-containing benzamide and was labeled with either carbon-11 or fluorine-18. [C-11]CMPyPB was synthesized by the alkylation of a 3-hydroxypyridine precursor using [C-11]MeI, and [F-18]MK-6577 was synthesized by a nucleophilic aromatic substitution reaction using a 2-chloropyridine precursor. Each tracer shows good uptake into rhesus monkey brain with the expected distribution of highest uptake in the pons, thalamus, and cerebellum and lower uptake in the striatum and gray matter of the frontal cortex. In vivo blockade and chase studies of [F-18]MK-6577 showed a large specific signal and reversible binding. In vitro autoradiographic studies with [F-18]MK-6577 showed a large specific signal in both rhesus monkey and human brain slices and a distribution consistent with the in vivo results and those reported in the literature. In vivo metabolism studies in rhesus monkeys demonstrated that only more-polar metabolites are formed for each tracer. Of these two tracers, [F-18]MK-6577 was more extensively characterized and is a promising clinical positron emission tomography tracer for imaging GlyT1 and for measuring GlyT1 occupancy of therapeutic compounds.

However, the mechanisms through which these therapeutic benefits are mediated remain poorly understood. Although the regulatory role of mGluR5 on glutamatergic transmission has been examined in various basal ganglia nuclei, very little is known about the localization and function of mGluR5 in the ventral motor and intralaminar thalamic nuclei, the main targets of basal ganglia output in mammals. Thus, we used immuno-electron microscopy to map the cellular and subcellular localization of group I mGluRs (mGluR1a and mGluR5) in the ventral motor and caudal intralaminar thalamic nuclei in rhesus monkeys. Furthermore, using double immuno-electron microscopy, we examined the subsynaptic localization of mGluR5 in relation to cortical and sub-cortical glutamatergic afferents. Four major conclusions can be drawn from these data. First, mGluR1a and mGluR5 are expressed postsynaptically on the plasma membrane of dendrites of projection neurons and GABAergic interneurons in the basal ganglia- and cerebellar-receiving regions of the ventral motor thalamus and in CM. Second, the plasma membrane-bound mGluR5 immunoreactivity is preferentially expressed perisynaptically at the edges of cortical and sub-cortical glutamatergic afferents. Third, the mGluR5 immunoreactivity is more strongly expressed in the lateral than the medial tiers of CM, suggesting a preferential association with thalamocortical over thalamostriatal neurons in the primate CM. Overall, mGluR5 is located to subserve powerful modulatory role of cortical and subcortical glutamatergic transmission in the primate ventral motor thalamus and CM.",Globus pallidus; Cerebellum; Rhesus monkey; mGluR; Parkinson's disease; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; LEVODOPA-INDUCED DYSKINESIA; NEGATIVE ALLOSTERIC MODULATOR; DOPA-INDUCED DYSKINESIA; BASAL-GANGLIA; SYNAPTIC-TRANSMISSION; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; SUBCELLULAR-LOCALIZATION; SOMATOSENSORY THALAMUS; THERAPEUTIC TARGETS

Only 5-10% of the input to geniculate relay cells derives from the retina, which is the driving input. The rest is modulatory and derives from local inhibitory inputs, descending inputs from layer 6 of the visual cortex, and ascending inputs from the brainstem, These modulatory inputs control many features of retinogeniculate transmission. One such feature is the response mode, burst or tonic, of relay cells, which relates to the attentional demands at the moment. This response mode depends on membrane potential, which is controlled effectively by the modulator inputs. The lateral geniculate nucleus is a first-order relay, because it relays subcortical (i.e. retinal) information to the cortex for the first time. By contrast, the other main thalamic relay of visual information, the pulvinar region, is largely a higher-order relay, since much of it relays information from layer 5 of one cortical area to another. All thalamic relays receive a layer-6 modulatory input from cortex, but higher-order relays in addition receive a layer-5 driver input. Corticocortical processing may involve these corticothalamocortical 're-entry' routes to a far greater extent than previously appreciated. If so, the thalamus sits at an indispensable position for the modulation of messages involved in corticocortical processing.",pulvinar; bursts; corticothalamic; drivers; modulators; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; STRIATE-RECIPIENT ZONE; VISUAL CORTICAL PROJECTIONS; CONTRAST GAIN-CONTROL; CORTICOTHALAMIC PROJECTIONS; SYNAPTIC ORGANIZATION; MACAQUE MONKEY; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; RESPONSE PROPERTIES

The mapping confirmed the existence of at least three tonotopic areas. Primary auditory cortex, AT, was then aspirated, and the remainder of the cortex on the supratemporal plane was remapped. PT-responses in the caudomedial area, CM, were abolished in all animals but one, in which they were restricted to the high-frequency range. Some CM sites were still responsive to complex stimuli. In contrast to the effects on CM, no significant changes were detectable in the rostral area, R. After mapping cortex in four additional monkeys, injections were made with different tracers into matched best-frequency regions of AI, R, and CM. Injections in Al and R led to retrograde labeling of neurons in all three subdivisions of the medial geniculate (MG) nucleus (MGv, MGd, and MGm), as well as nuclei outside MG, whereas CM injections led to only sparse labeling of neurons in a restricted zone of the lateral MGd and, possibly, MGm, in addition to labeling in non-MG sites. The combined results suggest that MGv sends direct projections in parallel to areas Al and R, which drive PT-responses in both areas. PT-responses in area CM, however, appear to be driven by input relayed serially from AI. The direct input to CM from MGd and other thalamic nuclei may thus be capable of mediating responses only to broad-band sounds.

Layers, loops and the emergence of fast synchronous rhythms","A large-scale computer model was constructed to gain insight into the structural basis for the generation of fast synchronous rhythms (20-60 Hz) in the thalamocortical system. The model consisted of 65 000 spiking neurons organized topographically to represent sectors of a primary and secondary area of mammalian visual cortex, and two associated regions of the dorsal thalamus and the thalamic reticular nucleus. Cortical neurons, both excitatory and inhibitory, were organized in supragranular layers, infraganular layers and layer IV. Reciprocal intra- and interlaminar, interareal, thalamocortical, corticothalamic and thalamoreticular connections were set up based on known anatomical constraints. Simulations of neuronal responses to visual input revealed sporadic epochs of synchronous oscillations involving all levels of the model, similar to the fast rhythms recorded in vivo. By systematically modifying physiological and structural parameters in the model, specific network properties were found to play a major role in the generation of this rhythmic activity. For example, fast synchronous rhythms could be sustained autonomously by lateral and interlaminar interactions within and among local cortical circuits. In addition, these oscillations were propagated to the thalamus and amplified by corticothalamocortical loops, including the thalamic reticular complex. Finally, synchronous oscillations were differentially affected by lesioning forward and backward interareal connections.",nan; CAT VISUAL-CORTEX; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; OSCILLATORY NEURONAL RESPONSES; THALAMIC RETICULAR NUCLEUS; STRIATE CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; CORTICAL AREAS; CORTICOCORTICAL CONNECTIONS; ORIENTATION SELECTIVITY; INHIBITORY CONNECTIONS

Lesions of the anterior thalamus in macaques produce impairments which resemble those seen after lesions of the fornix-mamillary pathway, which carries projections from the hippocampus to the anterior thalamus, while lesions of the mediodorsal thalamus, which receives inputs from frontal and temporal cortex, produce moderate impairments on a wider range of memory tasks. In the present study, we have made bilateral excitotoxic lesions of either the anterior or the mediodorsal thalamus, or both, in marmoset monkeys. Monkeys with lesions of both thalamic nuclei were severely impaired on retention and new learning of examples of the visuospatial conditional task, a task which is specifically impaired by lesions of the fornix or hippocampus. They were not impaired on performance of a visuovisual conditional task on which monkeys with hippocampal lesions are impaired, nor were they impaired on any visual discrimination task, including the concurrent discrimination task on which monkeys with temporal neocortical ablations are impaired. Monkeys with separate lesions of either the anterior or the mediodorsal thalamus were not impaired on any of these tasks. These results suggest that the mediodorsal thalamus and the anterior thalamus are both involved in processing the output of the hippocampal-fornix-thalamic circuit. Dense amnesia may result from damage to circuits additional to the temporal lobe efferents to either the anterior or the mediodorsal nuclei. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Summary of Review-Thalamic nuclei are composed of 5 major functional classes: reticular and intralaminar nuclei that subserve arousal and nociception; sensory nuclei in all major domains; effector nuclei concerned with motor function and aspects of language; associative nuclei that participate in high-level cognitive functions; and limbic nuclei concerned with mood and motivation. Vascular lesions destroy these nuclei in different combinations and produce sensorimotor and behavioral syndromes depending on which nuclei are involved. Tuberothalamic territory strokes produce impairments of arousal and orientation, learning and memory, personality, and executive function; superimposition of temporally unrelated information; and emotional facial paresis. Paramedian infarcts cause decreased arousal, particularly if the lesion is bilateral, and impaired learning and memory. Autobiographical memory impairment and executive failure result from lesions in either of these vascular territories. Language deficits result from left paramedian lesions and from left tuberothalamic lesions that include the ventrolateral nucleus. Right thalamic lesions in both these vascular territories produce visual-spatial deficits, including hemispatial neglect. Inferolateral territory strokes produce contralateral hemisensory loss, hemiparesis and hemiataxia, and pain syndromes that are more common after right thalamic lesions. Posterior choroidal lesions result in visual field deficits, variable sensory loss, weakness, dystonia, tremors, and occasionally amnesia and language impairment. Conclusions-These vascular syndromes reflect the reciprocal cerebral cortical-thalamic connections that have been interrupted and provide insights into the functional properties of the thalamus.",cerebral cortex; cognition; diaschisis; language; memory; thalamus; ARTERY TERRITORY INFARCTION; TRANSIENT GLOBAL AMNESIA; POSTERIOR COMMUNICATING ARTERY; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL SULCUS; MEDIAL PULVINAR NUCLEUS; PSYCHIC SELF-ACTIVATION; RHESUS-MONKEY; CORTICOTHALAMIC CONNECTIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MACACA-FASCICULARIS

The main sources of thalamocortical inputs to the auditory cortex are the medial geniculate complex (MGC), medial pulvinar (PM), and several adjoining nuclei in the posterior thalamus. The distribution of inputs varies topographically by cortical area and thalamic nucleus, but in a manner that has not been fully characterized in primates. In this study, the thalamocortical connections of the lateral belt and parabelt were determined by placing retrograde tracer injections into various areas of these regions in the marmoset monkey. Both regions received projections from the medial (MGm) and posterodorsal (MGpd) divisions of the medial geniculate complex (MGC); however, labeled cells in the anterodorsal (MGad) division were present only from injections into the caudal belt. Thalamic inputs to the lateral belt appeared to come mainly from the MGC, whereas the parabelt also received a strong projection from the PM, consistent with its position as a later stage of auditory cortical processing. The results of this study also indicate that the organization of the marmoset auditory cortex is similar to other primates. Anat Rec, 2012.

Thalamocortical inputs arise in parallel from four divisions of the medial geniculate complex (MGC), which have regionally distinct projection patterns. These inputs terminate in layers IIIb and/or IV, and are assumed to be glutamatergic, although this has not been verified. In the present study, immunoreactivity (-ir) for the vesicular glutamate transporter, VGluT2, was used to estimate the regional and laminar distribution of the glutamatergic thalamocortical projection in the macaque auditory cortex. Coronal sections containing auditory cortex were processed for VGluT2 and other markers concentrated in the thalamorecipient layers: cytochrome oxidase, acetylcholinesterase, and parvalbumin. Marker expression was studied with wide field and confocal microscopy. The main findings were: (1) VGkuT2-ir was highest in the core, intermediate in the belt, and sparse in the parabelt; (2) VGluT2-ir was concentrated in the neuropil of layers IIIb/IV in the core and layer IIIb in the belt; (3) VGluT2-ir matched regional and laminar expression of the other chemoarchitectonic markers. The results indicate that the glutamatergic thalamic projection to auditory cortex, as indexed by VGluT-2-ir, varies along the core-belt-parabelt axis in a manner that matches the gradients of other markers. These chemoarchitectonic features are likely to subserve regional differences in neuronal activity between regions of auditory cortex. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V.

In the present study, we aimed to identify the sensorimotor nuclei of the thalamus in humans using task-based fMRI at a field strength of 9.4T by assessing the individual subject-specific sensorimotor BOLD response during a combined active motor (finger-tapping) and passive sensory (tactile-finger) stimulation. We demonstrate that both tasks increase BOLD signal response in the lateral nuclei group (VPL, VA, VLa, and VLp), and in the pulvinar nuclei group (PuA, PuM, and PuL). Finger-tapping stimuli evokes a stronger BOLD response compared to the tactile stimuli, and additionally engages the intralaminar nuclei group (CM and Pf). In addition, our results demonstrate reproducible thalamic nuclei activation during motor and tactile stimuli.

One likely source is the central thalamus, which contains neurons sensitive to eye position. Because the central thalamus receives inputs from the brainstem, these neurons may transmit eye position signals arising from the neural integrator or from proprioceptive feedback. However, because the central thalamus also receives inputs from many cortical areas, eye position signals in the central thalamus could come from the cerebral cortex. To clarify these possibilities, spatial and temporal properties of eye position signals in the central thalamus were examined in trained monkeys. Data showed that eye position signals were decomposed into horizontal and vertical components, suggesting that the central thalamus lies within pathways that transmit brainstem eye position signals to the cortex. Further quantitative analyses suggested that 2 distinct groups of thalamic neurons mediate eye position signals from different subcortical origins, and that the signals are modified dynamically through ascending pathways. Eye position signals through the central thalamus may play essential roles in spatial transformation performed by cortical networks.",efference copy; monkey; neural integrator; single neurons; thalamocortical pathways; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; PREMOTOR CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; MEDIODORSAL THALAMUS; RESPONSE PROPERTIES; ABDUCENS NUCLEUS; FRONTAL-CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY

Small pools (5-15 cells) of neurons were microiontophoretically injected with biotin-dextran or biocytin and their labeled axons were individually reconstructed from serial horizontal sections immunostained for calbindin-D28k to delineate striatal patch/matrix compartments. Reconstruction of >40 axons shows that all Cg3 corticofugal fibers, including corticothalamic axons from layer VI, course through the patch network in the rostromedial sector of the striatum. Corticostriatal projections arise from two types of layer V cells: (i) long-range corticofugal neurons, whose main axons reach the brainstem and/or spinal cord, and (ii) neurons arborizing into both striatum and claustrum, either ipsi-. contra- or bilaterally. The axons of these two types of neurons arborize profusely in striatal patches and only sparsely in the matrix. Layer VI neurons do not arborize in the striatum but target principally the thalamus. The same corticothalamic axon can innervate the anterior, rostral intralaminar and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei. These findings support the concept that no corticofugal fiber system exists that is solely devoted to the striatum. They also shed new light on how neural information from prelimbic cortex is conveyed to various subcortical limbic structures in the rat.",nan; SENSORY-MOTOR CORTEX; FRONTAL EYE FIELD; MACAQUE MONKEY; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; EFFERENT CONNECTIONS; MACACA-FASCICULARIS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; LAMINAR ORIGIN; RHESUS-MONKEY; TOPOGRAPHICAL ORGANIZATION

Brainstem pathways to this nucleus have been described in several species and are believed to control the retinocortical pathway depending on the state of the animal (awake, asleep, drowsy, etc.). The purpose of this study was to determine all of the subcortical sources of afferents to the dLGN in a higher primate, the macaque monkey, whose visual system is similar to that of humans. Methods: Injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP), with or without conjugation to wheat germ agglutinin, were made into the dLGNs of seven macaque monkeys, followed by perfusion, brain sectioning, and analyses of neurons in the brainstem, thalamus, and hypothalamus that contained the retrogradely transported marker. Results: The reticular nucleus of the thalamus, pedunculopontine nucleus, parabigeminal nucleus, pretectal nucleus of the optic tract, superior colliculus, dorsal raphe nucleus, and tuberomammillary region of the hypothalamus contained many retrogradely labeled neurons ipsilateral to the injections. In the contralateral brainstem, HRP-labeled cells were found only in the pedunculopontine nucleus, nucleus of the optic tract, and dorsal raphe nucleus. The number of labeled neurons on the contralateral side was about one-half of that in corresponding ipsilateral nuclei. The locus coeruleus contained no labeled neurons in four of the macaques that had injections limited to the dLGN. Conclusion: There are seven subcortical regions that send afferents to the dLGNs of macaque monkeys. Except for the locus coeruleus, these are the same as observed for other species, such as the cat and rat, and indicate the possible sources of subcortical control over the dLGrNs of humans.

The cartographic method relied on the use of intracerebral, ventricular landmarks (CA: anterior commissure and CP: posterior commissure). The basal ganglia outlines, first drawn in transverse sections perpendicular to the CA-CP plane, were reconstructed on the horizontal and midsagittal planes. Maps from several individuals were superimposed and statistical variations studied. The results confirm that the length between the two CA and CP points is statistically greater (7%) in the Macaca mulatta than Macaca fascicularis but reveal considerable inter-individual differences. The closer a given nucleus is from a ventricular reference point, the more stable its outline. Superimpositions led to a statistical determination of the stereotaxic coordinates required to reach a given target center. Comparison of the lateralities with those measured in six previously published atlases indicates that the brain mapped by Snider and Lee [17] is the smallest and that mapped by Olszewski [8] is the largest.",striatum; pallidum; subthalamic nucleus; monkeys; macaques; cerebral cartography; ventricular system; THALAMIC STEREOTAXY; MACACA; MONKEYS; SURGERY; LANDMARKS

Some thalamocortical pathways relay information from ascending pathways (first order thalamic relays) and others relay information from other cortical areas (higher order thalamic relays), thus serving a role in corticocortical communication. Most, possibly all, afferents reaching thalamus, ascending and cortical, are branches of axons that innervate lower (motor) centers, so that thalamocortical pathways can be viewed generally as monitors of ongoing motor instructions. In terms of numbers, the thalamic relay is dominated by synapses that modulate the relay functions. One of the roles of these modulatory pathways is to change the transfer of information through the thalamus, in accord with current attentional demands. Other roles remain to be explored. These modulatory functions can be expected to act on corticocortical communication in addition to their action on ascending pathways.",nan; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; METABOTROPIC GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; CONTRAST GAIN-CONTROL; ELECTRON-MICROSCOPIC ANALYSIS; POSTERIOR-PULVINAR COMPLEX; STRIATE-RECIPIENT ZONE; CORTICOTHALAMIC PROJECTIONS; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; MACAQUE MONKEY; PHA-L

Young are born after 26-28 days of gestation and do not open their eyes until around 140 days after birth. Horseradish peroxidase conjugated to wheatgerm agglutinin was injected in the visual thalamus in adults and in pouch young aged from 22 days after birth, just after thalamic axons first reach the visual cortex, to 118 days, when cortical lamination resembles the adult. From 22 to 65 days, the developing visual cortex consists of a marginal zone (MZ), cortical plate (CP), and intermediate zone (IZ) including the superficial subplate (SP), subventricular zone, and ventricular zone. There is a thin compact cell zone (CCZ) at the top of the CP and below it a less densely packed region that increases in thickness with age. Retrogradely labelled cells in two bands were first seen at 40 days, one in the CCZ and the other at the base of the CP. Two bands of cells were seen at all subsequent times if the injection covered both LGNd and LP, and by 76 days, these cells were located within cytoarchitectonically recognizable layers V and VI. Anterograde label prior to 45 days was distributed densely and evenly throughout the IZ and the CP up to the CCZ. Label in MZ was first seen at 25 days and was substantial by 54 days. Anterograde label then became gradually reduced in the IZ, whereas in the CP it remained evenly and densely distributed until 82 days. At this age, coincident with the emergence of layer IV, label within the CP first showed variations in density and by 99 days was concentrated over layer IV and, to a lesser extent, over layer VI. By 118 days label resembled the adult after injections covering both LGNd and LP, with label concentrated in layer I, IV, and VI with a less dense projection to lower layer III and upper layer V. There is a relatively earlier initial ingrowth of axons into the visual cortex in the wallaby and throughout development thalamocortical axons appear to be more widely distributed in the depth of the visual cortex than has been demonstrated for placental mammals. They are densely distributed up to the thin CCZ of the CP long before lamination of the cortex emerges beneath this zone. Soon after retrogradely labelled cells are first seen, the two bands of these cells that project to the LGNd and LP and ultimately reside in layers V and VI are also located in the region below the CCZ occupied by thalamocortical afferents. The question arises as to whether there is a waiting period in the SP in the wallaby. If there is not, this may be a genuine difference with placental mammals or a result of the more sensitive technique used here to demonstrate thalamocortical afferents.",GENICULOCORTICAL; LAMINATION; SEGREGATION; MAMMALIAN; ANATOMY; RHESUS-MONKEY; PRENATAL DEVELOPMENT; MACROPUS-EUGENII; TAMMAR WALLABY; POSTNATAL-DEVELOPMENT; CORTICAL PROJECTIONS; OCULAR DOMINANCE; ACCESSIBLE MODEL; CONNECTIONS; CATS

By using both passively and actively transported axonal tracers in fetal and postnatal ferrets, we have analyzed the development of projections from the cortex to a number of thalamic nuclei. We report that the projections of a cortical area to its corresponding thalamic nuclei follow highly cell-specific programs of development, Axons from cells in the deepest layers of the cerebral cortex (layer 6 and superficial subplate neurons) appear to grow very slowly and be delayed for several weeks in the cerebral white matter, reaching the thalamus over a protracted period, Neurons of layer 5, on the other hand, develop their projections much faster; despite being born after the neurons of deeper layers, layer 5 neurons are the first to extend their axons out of the cortical hemisphere and innervate the thalamus, Layer 5 projections are massive in the first postnatal weeks but may become partly eliminated later in development, being overtaken in number by layer 6 cells that constitute the major corticothalamic projection by adulthood. Layer 5 projections are area-specific from the outset and arise as collateral branches of axons directed to the brainstem and spinal cord. Our findings show that the early development of corticofugal connections is determined not by the sequence of cortical neurogenesis but by developmental programs specific for each type of projection neuron, In addition, they demonstrate that in most thalamic nuclei, layer 5 neurons (and not subplate or layer 6 neurons) establish the first descending projections from the cerebral cortex.",CEREBRAL CORTEX; CORTICOTHALAMIC PROJECTION; THALAMUS; FERRET; AXONAL GROWTH; VISUAL CORTICAL-NEURONS; RHESUS-MONKEY; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; FERRET; AXONS; SUBPLATE; PATHWAYS; ESTABLISHMENT; CONNECTIVITY; GENESIS

Regional net accumulation rate constants were derived from kinetic (two-tissue compartment model with irreversible tracer trapping) and graphic (Patlak) analyses, using the arterial plasma concentrations as input. The kinetic data analysis showed that the rate constant for the transfer of [C-11]HTP into the brain (K-1) was higher than that for [C-11]AMT in the striatum and thalamus but was similar in other brain regions. The rate constant for tracer trapping (k(3)) was also higher for [C-11]HTP than for [C-11]AMT in the striatum (0.046 +/- 0.024 versus 0.019 +/- 0.006 min(-1)) and thalamus (0.039 +/- 0.013 versus 0.016 +/- 0.007 min(-1)). In agreement with previously reported regional HTP accumulation rates, the net accumulation rate constant (K-acc) for [C-11]HTP was also higher in these regions than in other brain regions; this is in contrast to the uniform distribution of [C-11]AMT Kacc values. This suggests that the regional net accumulation rates obtained with these two PET tracers will be of different magnitude, which might be related to the activity of each targeted enzyme.",biosynthesis; 5-hydroxy-L-tryptophan; alpha-methyl-L-tryptophan; positron emission tomography; rhesus monkey; serotonin; METHYL-L-TRYPTOPHAN; SUB-CORTICAL STRUCTURES; IN-VIVO; AMINO-ACIDS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; SYNTHESIS RATES; 5-HT SYNTHESIS; PET; METABOLISM; KINETICS

We also developed a highly efficient method for long-range tracing of sparse axonal fibers in datasets numbering hundreds of terabytes. This pipeline, which we call serial sectioning and clearing, three-dimensional microscopy with semi-automated reconstruction and tracing (SMART), enables effective connectome-scale mapping of large primate brains. With SMART, we were able to construct a cortical projection map of the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus and identify distinct turning and routing patterns of individual axons in the cortical folds while approaching their arborization destinations.",nan; MEDIODORSAL NUCLEUS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; TISSUE; VISUALIZATION; PROJECTIONS; HISTOLOGY; CIRCUITS; THALAMUS; SPEED

However, recent studies in the monkey have documented projections from MD to the more caudal, agranular regions of the frontal cortex, suggesting that the connections of MD may be characterized by a breadth of distribution and diversity of functional roles too great to be useful as a unifying and defining feature for a specific cortical territory. In this study, we placed tracer injections in the lateral divisions of MD in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) to assess the relative proportions of connections devoted to diverse regions of the frontal cortex (FC). Three different patterns of label were observed in the cortex, associated with different locations within lateral MD. We have designated these as the ventrolateral MD-arcuate FC circuit, having most label in areas 8 and 6; the caudoventral MD-dorsomedial FC circuit, having most label in areas 24 and presupplementary motor area (SMA); and the anterodorsal MD-anterior FC circuit, with the most label in areas 9, 46, 12, and 10. Only two of the nine cases injected in lateral MD were predominantly connected with the anterior FC. Thus, particular locales within lateral MD are connected with multiple, functionally diverse cortical regions, including several not classically recognized as prefrontal areas. This divergence may distinguish MD-frontocortical and reciprocal corticothalamic pathways from the largely segregated pathways arising from the other thalamic nuclei that are interconnected with the frontal cortex, such as those from the ventrolateral nuclear group.

Here, we describe a set of computational tools to generate in vivo, subject-specific atlases of individual thalamic nuclei thus improving the ability to visualize thalamic targets for preclinical DBS applications on a subject-specific basis. A sequential nonlinear atlas warping technique and a Bayesian estimation technique for probabilistic crossing fiber tractography were applied to high field (7T) susceptibility-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging, respectively, in seven rhesus macaques. Image contrast, including contrast within thalamus from the susceptibility-weighted images, informed the atlas warping process and guided the seed point placement for fiber tractography. The susceptibility-weighted imaging resulted in relative hyperintensity of the intralaminar nuclei and relative hypointensity in the medial dorsal nucleus, pulvinar, and the medial/ventral border of the ventral posterior nuclei, providing context to demarcate borders of the ventral nuclei of thalamus, which are often targeted for DBS applications. Additionally, ascending fiber tractography of the medial lemniscus, superior cerebellar peduncle, and pallidofugal pathways into thalamus provided structural demarcation of the ventral nuclei of thalamus. The thalamic substructure boundaries were validated through in vivo electrophysiological recordings and post-mortem blockface tissue sectioning. Together, these imaging tools for visualizing and segmenting thalamus have the potential to improve the neurosurgical targeting of DBS implants and enhance the selection of stimulation settings through more accurate computational models of DBS.",thalamus; high-field imaging; susceptibility weighted imaging; diffusion weighted imaging; fiber; tractography; HUMAN BASAL GANGLIA; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; HIGH-RESOLUTION; ESSENTIAL TREMOR; AUTOMATIC REGISTRATION; AFFINE REGISTRATION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; DEFORMABLE ATLAS; MR-IMAGES; IRON

How the brain decides the timing of self-initiated movements remains unclear. Previous studies suggest that the basal ganglia-thalamocortical pathways play this role, but the subcortical signals that determine movement timing have not been identified. The present study reports that a subset of thalamic neurons predicts the timing of self-initiated saccadic eye movements. When monkeys made a saccade in response to the fixation point ( FP) offset in the traditional memory saccade task, neurons in the ventrolateral and the ventroanterior nuclei of the thalamus exhibited a gradual buildup of activity that peaked around the most probable time of the FP offset; however, neither the timing nor the magnitude of neuronal activity correlated with saccade latencies, suggesting that the brain is unlikely to have used this information to decide the times of saccades in the traditional memory saccade task. In contrast, when monkeys were required to make a self-timed saccade within a fixed time interval after an external cue, the same neurons again exhibited a strong buildup of activity that preceded saccades by several hundred milliseconds, showing a close correlation between the times of neuronal activity and the times of self-initiated saccades. The results suggest that neurons in the motor thalamus carry subjective time information, which is used by cortical networks to determine the timing of self-initiated saccades.",saccade; self-timing; thalamus; motor system; physiology; primate; CONTINGENT NEGATIVE-VARIATION; GENERATED LIMB MOVEMENTS; DELAY-PERIOD ACTIVITY; BASAL GANGLIA; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; FRONTAL-CORTEX; INTERNAL GENERATION; VOLUNTARY MOVEMENT; GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; RHESUS-MONKEY

Magnetic resonance and [F-18]-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography brain images were acquired in 59 healthy subject. Correlation matrices for relative glucose metabolic rates during a verbal learning task and for relative gray matter volumes were compiled between the manually traced mediodorsal, centromedian, and pulvinar nuclei of the thalamus and 39 cortical Brodmann's areas. Metabolic correlations between the cortex and these thalamic nuclei followed the known patterns of anatomical connectivity in non-human primates. Intercorrelations of the mediodorsal nucleus were widespread with the prefrontal cortex (9 out of 10 Brodmann's areas in the left hemisphere) and temporal lobe (10 out of 11 Brodmann's areas in the left hemisphere) while the pulvinar correlated only with the parietal and occipital cortical areas. Different correlation patterns were observed for the regional gray matter volumes whereby only the pulvinar yielded extensive cortical intercorrelations, primarily with the occipital, parietal, anterior cingulate, and orbitofrontal areas in the right hemisphere. Metabolic thalamocortical correlations were much more extensive for the mediodorsal and centromedian nuclei whereas structural correlations were more extensive for the pulvinar. Therefore, metabolic and volumetric correlational methods are sensitive to different aspects of interregional relations in the brain and their comparison in the same group of subjects may render complementary and only partially overlapping connectivity information.

Concomitant hypoperfusion of the ipsilateral thalamus on interictal SPECT has been noted for temporal robe epilepsy. In this study, wp aimed to evaluate the prevalence of thalamic hypoperfusion ipsilateral to temporal hypoperfusion (ipsilateral thalamic hypoperfusion) and to assess the usefulness of this finding for the lateralization of epileptic foci on interictal SPECT for temporal lobe epilepsy patients. Methods: Forty-six patients with refractory temporal lobe epilepsy underwent interictal brain SPECT after intravenous injection of 555-740 MBq of Tc-99m-ECD. Perfusion impairments in the brain, especially the temporal lobe and thalamus, were evaluated. The localization of seizure foci was determined in conjunction with scalp, ictal and cortical electroencephalography, MRI and clinical outcomes. Ictal SPECT was performed for 5 of the 12 patients, Results: Concomitant decreased perfusion in both the temporal lobe and the ipsilateral thalamus was observed for 12 (26%) of 46 temporal lobe epilepsy patients on interictal brain SPECT. Seven patients showed hypoperfusion in the left temporal lobe and ipsilateral thalamus. Five patients showed hypoperfusion in the right temporal lobe and ipsilateral thalamus. In addition, hypoperfusion in the ipsilateral basal ganglia (ten patients) or contralateral cerebellum (four patients) was observed. Conclusion: Ipsilateral thalamic hypoperfusion is not uncommon in temporal lobe epilepsy. The exact mechanism causing ipsilateral thalamic hypoperfusion is uncertain; however, corticothalamic diaschisis may be an important factor.

To aid in functional and structural data analysis, we have created a comprehensive parcellation of the rhesus macaque subcortex using a high-resolution ex vivo structural imaging scan. This anatomical scan and its parcellation were warped to the updated NIMH Macaque Template (NMT v2), an in vivo population template, where the parcellation was refined to produce the Subcortical Atlas of the Rhesus Macaque (SARM) with 210 primary regions-of-interest (ROIs). The subcortical parcellation and nomenclature reflect those of the 4th edition of the Rhesus Monkey Brain in Stereotaxic Coordinates (Paxinos et al., in preparation ), rather than proposing yet another novel atlas. The primary ROIs are organized across six spatial hierarchical scales from small, fine-grained ROIs to broader composites of multiple ROIs, making the SARM suitable for analysis at different resolutions and allowing broader labeling of functional signals when more accurate localization is not possible. As an example application of this atlas, we have included a functional localizer for the dorsal lateral geniculate (DLG) nucleus in three macaques using a visual flickering checkerboard stimulus, identifying and quantifying significant fMRI activation in this atlas region. The SARM has been made openly available to the neuroimaging community and can easily be used with common MRI data processing software, such as AFNI, where the atlas has been embedded into the software alongside cortical macaque atlases.",Segmentation; Anatomy; Subcortex; Cerebellum; Thalamus; Brainstem; BRAIN ATLAS; MONKEY; ORGANIZATION; MRI; AMYGDALA; NORMALIZATION; STIMULATION; PROJECTIONS; TEMPLATE; MIDBRAIN

However, it is not clear whether the neural connections of the posteroventral part differ from those of the rest of the posterior cingulate gyrus. Here, we describe the thalamic connections of the posteroventral part of monkey area 23b (pv-area 23b), the main component of the posteroventral posterior cingulate gyrus. We compare these thalamic connections with those of the more dorsal area 23b (d-area 23b) and of adjoining retrosplenial areas 29 and 30. Thalamocortical projections to pv-area 23b originate mainly from the anterior nuclei, nucleus lateralis posterior and medial pulvinar. In contrast, projections to d-area 23b originate from the nucleus lateralis posterior, medial pulvinar, nucleus centralis latocellularis, mediodorsal nucleus and nucleus ventralis anterior and lateralis and weakly from the anterior nuclei. Projections to retrosplenial areas 29 and 30 originate from the anterior nuclei. Corticothalamic projections from pv-area 23b terminate in the anterior and laterodorsal nuclei, nucleus lateralis posterior and medial pulvinar. Projections from d-area 23b terminate in these nuclei as well as the nucleus ventralis anterior and lateralis. Projections from area 30 terminate mainly in the anterior nuclei and, to a lesser extent, in the medial pulvinar. These results show that the connections of pv-area 23b differ from those of d-area 23b or areas 29 and 30. This suggests that pv-area 23b may play distinct functional roles in memory processes, such as spatial and auditory memory.",anterior thalamic nuclei; area 23b; medial pulvinar; nucleus lateralis posterior; retrosplenial cortex; RHESUS-MONKEY; RETROSPLENIAL CORTEX; TETRAMETHYL BENZIDINE; MEDIODORSAL NUCLEUS; AFFERENTS; MEMORY; ANTERIOR; AMNESIA; SENSITIVITY; PROJECTIONS

However, less is known about the structural connectivity of the precuneus and thalamus to regions within the DMN. We used diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to parcellate the precuneus and thalamus based on their probabilistic white matter connectivity to each other and DMN regions of interest (ROIs) in 37 healthy subjects from the Human Connectome Database. We further assessed resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) among the precuneus, thalamus, and DMN ROIs. The precuneus was found to have the greatest structural connectivity with the thalamus, where connection fractional anisotropy (FA) increased with age. The precuneus also showed significant structural connectivity to the hippocampus and middle pre-frontal cortex, but minimal connectivity to the angular gyrus and midcingulate cortex. In contrast, the precuneus exhibited significant RSFC with the thalamus and the strongest RSFC with the AG. Significant symmetrical structural connectivity was found between the thalamus and hippocampus, mPFC, sFG, and precuneus that followed known thalamocortical pathways, while thalamic RSFC was strongest with the precuneus and hippocampus. Overall, these findings reveal high levels of structural and functional connectivity linking the thalamus, precuneus, and DMN. Differences between structural and functional connectivity (such as between the precuneus and AG) may be interpreted to reflect dynamic shifts in RSFC for cortical hub-regions involved with consciousness, but could also reflect the limitations of DTI to detect superficial white matter tracts that connect cortico-cortical regions.

In order to determine the origin and extent of corticocortical and thalamocortical projections to layer I of the frontal/premotor area M2 of the rat neocortex, we have used fluorescent anatomical tracing methods to determine the precise sources of cortical and thalamic input to the rostral and caudal aspects of layer I of M2. Retrograde tracer diamidino yellow (DY), applied directly to the pial surface on rostral or caudal areas of rat M2 (RM2 and CM2, respectively) labeled cells ipsilaterally throughout layers II/III, V, and VII of the adjacent primary motor area and the parietal areas (SI and SH). In addition, retrograde transport labeled contralateral CM2 or RM2 in layers II/III and V at sites homotopic to either CM2 or RM2 application sites. Contralateral layer VII was retrogradely labeled by the application to layer I of CM2, but not by the RM2 application. Retrograde DY transport from layer I of RM2 or CM2 of was seen in the ventral medial (VM), ventral lateral (VL), and posterior (Po) thalamic nuclei. However layer I transport from CM2 additionally labeled the thalamic central medial (CM) nucleus, while the RM2 labeled the mediodorsal (MD) thalamic nucleus. Upon determination that thalamic nuclei VM and VL were of primary interest in this study, due to their dense retrograde labeling, injections of anterograde tracer rhodamine dextranamine (RDA) into VM or VL were performed in order to study the projection patterns of these nuclei to layer I of the frontal cortex. RDA injections into VM labeled fibers extending through layer I of both RM2 and CM2 and throughout the cingulate cortex. Injections of RDA into VL consistently labeled dense fibers in layer I of both CM2 and RM2, although labeling was sharply decreased anterior to CM2. This study adds to a growing body of evidence that projections to layer I from all sources of cortical input make a significant contribution to integration throughout the neocortex.

However, little is known about protein expression patterns in other areas of the brain. In situ hybridization studies have shown high ErbB4 mRNA levels in various subcortical areas, suggesting that ErbB4 is also expressed in cell types other than cortical interneurons. Here, using highly-specific monoclonal antibodies, we provide the first extensive report of ErbB4 protein expression throughout the cerebrum of primates. We show that ErbB4 immunoreactivity is high in association cortices, intermediate in sensory cortices, and relatively low in motor cortices. The overall immunoreactivity in the hippocampal formation is intermediate, but is high in a subset of interneurons. We detected the highest overall immunoreactivity in distinct locations of the ventral hypothalamus, medial habenula, intercalated nuclei of the amygdala and structures of the ventral forebrain, such as the islands of Calleja, olfactory tubercle and ventral pallidum, and medium expression in the reticular thalamic nucleus. While this pattern is generally consistent with ErbB4 mRNA expression data, further investigations are needed to identify the exact cellular and subcellular sources of mRNA and protein expression in these areas. In contrast to in situ hybridization in rodents, we detected only low levels of ErbB4-immunoreactivity in mesencephalic dopaminergic nuclei but a diffuse pattern of immunofluorescence that was medium in the dorsal striatum and high in the ventral forebrain, suggesting that most ErbB4 protein in dopaminergic neurons could be transported to axons. We conclude that the NRG-ErbB4 signaling pathway can potentially influence many functional systems throughout the brain of primates, and suggest that major sites of action are areas of the corticolimbic network. This interpretation is functionally consistent with the genetic association of NRG1 and ERBB4 with schizophrenia.",nan; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; PARVALBUMIN-POSITIVE INTERNEURONS; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; TYROSINE KINASE; DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION; GABAERGIC INTERNEURONS; SEXUAL DEVELOPMENT; RETICULAR NUCLEUS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; RAT HIPPOCAMPUS

However, it is unclear how neurons in different cortical layers and circuits contribute. We simultaneously recorded from central lateral thalamus (CL) and across layers of the frontoparietal cortex in awake, sleeping, and anesthetized macaques. We found that neurons in thalamus and deep cortical layers are most sensitive to changes in consciousness level, consistent across different anesthetic agents and sleep. Deep-layer activity is sustained by interactions with CL. Consciousness also depends on deep-layer neurons providing feedback to superficial layers (not to deep layers), suggesting that long-range feedback and intracolumnar signaling are important. To show causality, we stimulated CL in anesthetized macaques and effectively restored arousal and wake-like neural processing. This effect was location and frequency specific. Our findings suggest layer-specific thalamocortical correlates of consciousness and inform how targeted deep brain stimulation can alleviate disorders of consciousness.",nan; FRONTAL EYE FIELDS; INTRALAMINAR NUCLEI; MEDIODORSAL NUCLEUS; AROUSAL REGULATION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; AUDITORY-STIMULI; CORTICAL AREAS; VISUAL-CORTEX; MACAQUE; AFFERENTS

Nonhuman primate studies have highlighted the crucial role of the cerebellum for saccade adaptation, but its neural substrates in humans are poorly understood. Recent physiological experiments suggest that, in addition to cerebellar structures, cortical areas may be involved as well. We have therefore hypothesized that saccade adaptation may rely on a cerebello-cerebral network, in which the cerebellar thalamus may link cerebellar and cerebral structures. To test this hypothesis, we studied saccade adaptation in a group of four patients with a thalamic lesion, with (n=2) or without (n=2) involvement of the cerebellar thalamus. Compared to healthy subjects, saccade adaptation was reduced in patients with associated cerebellar syndrome, but normal in patients without cerebellar syndrome. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that cerebello-thalamic pathways contribute to saccade adaptation in humans and suggest that the thalamus relays adaptation-related information from the cerebellum to cerebral cortical oculomotor areas.",adaptation; human; oculomotor system; saccade; thalamus; MONKEY SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; SUPPLEMENTARY EYE FIELD; FASTIGIAL NUCLEUS; INTRACORTICAL MICROSTIMULATION; ATAXIC HEMIPARESIS; FUNCTIONAL-ANATOMY; OCULOMOTOR REGION; GAIN ADAPTATION; MACAQUE MONKEYS; DENTATE NUCLEUS

Methods: Nissl-stained sections were examined to determine the boundaries of, and the distribution of neuronal sizes within, the medial pulvinar, In addition, Golgi-impregnated neurons were examined and drawn for analysis, Only rhesus monkey specimens were used, and the material had been prepared previously for other studies. Results: Projection neurons have round to oval somata and moderate numbers of primary dendrites that extend for short distances before branching into many secondary branches, Two variations of projection neurons (P1 and P2) were distinguished on the basis of the diameters of their dendritic tree, Both varieties have short dendrites that radiate in all directions, They differ in that P2 cells have longer second tier dendrites than P1 cells, Three types of local circuit neurons, tufted, radiating and varicose, were distinguished on the basis of their dendritic morphology, Four types of afferent fibers were identified. Type 1 afferents form cone-shape terminal arbors. Type 2 afferents are similar to those reported for retinal or cortical terminals, Type 3 afferents are of medium thickness and of an unknown origin, Type 4 afferents are thin and have small varicosities consistent with previously described cortical afferents, Afferent fibers are predominantly oriented along the mediolateral axis of the nucleus. We observed putative contacts between some afferents and local circuit neurons and between local circuit neurons and projection neurons, Conclusions: Medial pulvinar neurons are generally smaller and rounder than those found in the adjacent pulvinar nuclei, These results provide additional evidence for structural distinctions between thalamic nuclei having different functions, However, the observed differences are subtle, In addition, the data in this report provide morphological evidence that cortical signals are likely to be integrated by means of the circuitry located within the nucleus.

This study investigated the morphology of single axons of entopeduncular neurons projecting to the motor thalamus by placing small injections of dextran biotin into the EP and reconstructing drawings of single axone from serial sections. There were two populations of entopeduncular-thalamic projection axone: those that projected only to the motor thalamus (VL and VM) and those that projected to both the motor thalamus and other nuclei (e.g., the habenula). The neurochemistry of EP neurons projecting to the thalamus was investigated by injecting the retrograde tracer FluoroCold into the VL and VM thalamic nuclei to retrogradely fill entopeduncular projection neurons. These were subsequently immunohistochemically labeled for choline acetyl transferase, gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and glutamate. Consistent with previous studies, significant proportions of these neurons were GABA immunoreactive. In addition, approximately half of the entopeduncular-thalamic projecting neurons were found to be cholinergic. This excitatory input is most likely derived from axons that branch as they pass through the motor thalamus to the lateral habenula.

Data we obtained in one patient after a limited left thalamic infarct bring some new insights into this debate. This patient presented sudden right-sided hypesthesia for both lemniscal (touch. vibration. joint position) and spinothalamic (pain and temperature) modalities. He subsequently developed right-sided central pain with allodynia. Projection of 3D magnetic resonance images onto a human thalamic atlas revealed a lesion involving the anterior two thirds of the ventral posterior lateral nucleus (VPL) and, to a lesser extent, the ventral posterior media (VPM) and inferior (VPI) nuclei. Conversely. the lesion did not extend posterior and ventral enough to concern the putative location of the spinothalamic-afferented nucleus VMpo. Neurophysiological Studies showed a marked reduction (67%) of cortical responses depending on dorsal column-lemniscal transmission. while spinothalamic-specific, CO2-laser induced cortical responses were only moderately attenuated (33%). Our results show that the VP is definitely involved in thermo-algesic transmission in man, and that its selective lesion can lead to central pain. However, results also suggest that much of the spino-thalamo-cortical volley elicited by painful heat stimuli does not transit through VP, supporting the hypothesis that a non-VP locus lying more posteriorly in the human thalamus is important for thermo-algesic transmission.

Fractional anisotropy reflects the integrity of white matter fibers. Fractional anisotropy of a young adult brain is low in gray matter, high in white matter, and highest in the splenium of the corpus callosum. Thus, we selected the anterior and posterior limbs of the internal capsule, head of the caudate nucleus, semioval center, thalamus, and corpus callosum (splenium and genu) as regions of interest when using diffusion-tensor imaging to observe fractional anisotropy of major white matter fiber tracts and the deep gray matter of healthy rhesus monkeys aged 4-8 years. Results showed no laterality differences in fractional anisotropy values. Fractional anisotropy values were low in the head of caudate nucleus and thalamus in gray matter. Fractional anisotropy values were highest in the splenium of corpus callosum in the white matter, followed by genu of the corpus callosum and the posterior limb of the internal capsule. Fractional anisotropy values were lowest in the semioval center and posterior limb of internal capsule.

Comp. Neurol. 262:331-364) was analyzed by using qualitative and quantitative neuroanatomical techniques. Projection neurons (PN), retrogradely labeled with wheat germ agglutinin conjugated horseradish peroxidase from the cortex, were small to medium in size (mean area, 312 mu m(2)) with numerous primary dendrites displaying a tufted branching pattern. Local circuit neurons (LCN), immunoreactive for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamic acid decarboxylase, were small (mean area, 110 mu m(2)), and gave off few dendrites. Two subpopulations of GABA positive boutons (F1 type) were distinguished: large (mean area, 2.6 mu m(2)) terminals with symmetric synapses containing few pleomorphic vesicles and numerous mitochondria densely covered proximal PN sites; smaller F1 boutons with a slightly different morphology contacted mostly distal PN dendrites. Two subpopulations of terminals containing round vesicles and forming asymmetric synapses were distinguished by bouton size (mean areas, 0.4 mu m(2) and 1.6 mu m(2), respectively). These targeted mainly distal PN dendrites, but some synapsed proximally next to large F1 boutons. On distal dendrites, representatives of both types were labeled from the cortex. The density of boutons with symmetric and asymmetric synapses (the number of boutons per 100 mu m of PN membrane length) was 3.3:0.2 on primary, 2.5:1.2 on secondary, and 0.8:12 on distal dendrites. The numerical density of synapses formed by presynaptic LCN dendrites on all PN levels was 20 to 40 times less than that of axon terminals at the same sites. Afferent input to LCN from boutons of all types, including that from 50% of labeled cortical boutons, mainly targeted distal dendrites. Overall, the findings suggest that PN in VAdc receive massive inhibitory input proximally intermingled with some presumably excitatory input, and that LCN contribution to PN inhibition is modest.

Axons were labeled from the thalamus by a fluorescent carbocyanine dye in fixed tissue or by transneuronal transport of horseradish peroxidase conjugated to wheat germ agglutinin from the eye. Thalamic axons first reached the cortex 2 weeks after birth and grew into the developing cortical plate without a waiting period in the subplate. The first thalamocortical synapses were detected 2 weeks later solely throughout the loosely packed zone of the cortical plate, where layer 6 cells previously have been shown to reside. As the thickness of the cortex increased with age, thalamocortical synapses were increasingly prevalent in the loosely packed zone of the cortical plate. With the appearance of layer 4, thalamocortical synapses were found there as well as in the marginal zone and layer 6. There was no evidence for an early population of thalamocortical synapses in the subplate.

Each injection resulted in anterograde labeling in the three subdivisions of the ventral anterior nucleus (pars parvicellularis, VApc; pars densicellularis, VAdc; and pars magnocellularis, VAmc) and in the ventral lateral nucleus (VL). NRT fibers had beaded shapes and coursed in a posterior direction giving rise to relatively diffuse terminal plexuses. The average size of the beads (0.7 mu m(2)) and their density per 100 mu m of fiber length (23.7-25.7) were similar between the nuclei studied. At the electron microscopic level, anterogradely labeled boutons displayed positive immunoreactivity for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), contained pleomorphic synaptic vesicles, and formed relatively long (similar to 0.4 mu m) symmetric synaptic contacts. Usually, a single terminal formed synapses on more than one postsynaptic structure. Synaptic contacts were on projection and local circuit neurons and targeted mainly their distal dendrites. In the VAmc, synapses on local circuit neurons composed 48% of the total sample, in the VAdc/VApc and in the VL the proportion was higher, 65% and 62%, respectively. The results suggest that the input from the anterior pole of the monkey reticular nucleus to the motor-related thalamic nuclei is organized differently from what is known on the organization of connections of NRT with sensory thalamic nuclei in other species in that the terminal fields of individual fibers are diffuse rather than focal and that at least 50% of synapses are established on GABAergic local circuit neurons.

The animals had to choose correctly between pairs of stimuli drawn from a population of 16. Four of these stimuli were associated with 0 reward pellets, four with 1 pellet, four with 2 pellets and four with 4 pellets. Mediodorsal thalamic lesions including the medial part of the mediodorsal nucleus, similar to those which are frequently seen in Korsakoff amnesia, produced a severe impairment in this task. The impairment was seen both in memory for the quantity of reward, as expressed in choices between 1-pellet and 2-pellet stimuli or choices between 2-pellet and 4-pellet stimuli, and also in memory for the qualitative absence or presence of reward, as expressed in choices between 0-pellet and 1-pellet stimuli. The deficit in this task establishes that mediodorsal thalamic lesions in monkeys can impair long-term memory tasks, in addition to their known effects on several short-term memory tasks. The contrast between the present results and those of previous experiments on visual long-term memory in the monkey following mediodorsal thalamic lesions can be related to similar contrasts in studies of lesions in the amygdala, suggesting that the functions of these two structures are related.",CYNOMOLGUS; AMNESIA; VISUAL LEARNING; MONKEYS; NUCLEUS; CORTEX

Multiple injections of combinations of two dyes (diamidino yellow dihydrochloride, Evans blue, fast blue, granular blue) were made into either the anterior and posterior sigmoid gyri or into the medial and lateral regions of the anterior sigmoid gyrus in the anesthetized dog. We found that the thalamic afferents of areas 4 and 6 arise from topographically organized bands of cells that traverse several thalamic nuclei and extend throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the thalamus. The most medial band included area 6-projecting neurons in the anterior nuclei, the rhomboid nucleus, the ventral anterior nucleus (VA), ventromedial nucleus (VM) and mediodorsal nucleus (MD). Within this band, cells projecting to medial area 6a alpha tended to be more numerous in the anterior nuclei, anterior parts of VA and VM and anterior and caudal parts of MD. Fewer cells in MD but more cells in caudal parts of VA and VM projected to lateral area 6a beta. Lateral bands of cells in central through lateral parts of VA and VL projected topographically to lateral area 4 on the anterior sigmoid gyrus and lateral through medial parts of postcruciate area 4. The most lateral band of cells in VL continued ventrally into the zona incerta. Area 4 also received input from VM and the central lateral (CL) and centrum medianum (CM) nuclei. Within regions of VA, VL and VM, cells from one band interspersed with cells from another, but there were very few double-labeled cells projecting to two cortical sites.

Actively detecting a vibrotactile stimulus and reporting its perception elicited a sustained poststimulus beta power increase in VPL and an alpha power decrease in S1, in both stimulus-present and stimulus-absent trials. These oscillatory dynamics in the somatosensory thalamocortical network depended on the behavioral context: they were stronger for the active detection condition than for a passive stimulation condition. Furthermore, contrasting stimulus-present vs. stimulus-absent responses, we found that poststimulus theta power increased in both VPL and S1, and alpha/beta power decreased in S1, reflecting the monkey's perceptual decision but not the motor response per se. Additionally, higher prestimulus alpha power in S1 correlated with an increased probability of the monkey reporting a stimulus, regardless of the actual presence of a stimulus. Thus, we found task-related modulations in oscillatory activity, not only in the neocortex but also in the thalamus, depending on behavioral context. Furthermore, oscillatory modulations reflected the perceptual decision process and subsequent behavioral response. We conclude that these early sensory regions, in addition to their primary sensory functions, may be actively involved in perceptual decision making.",nan; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; BETA-BAND OSCILLATIONS; SUBJECTIVE SENSORY EXPERIENCE; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; ALPHA-OSCILLATIONS; BINOCULAR-RIVALRY; SPATIAL ATTENTION; DECISION-MAKING; VISUAL THALAMUS

Lesions of the basal ganglia typically result in poverty of movement (e.g., akinesia) or excessive movement (e.g., hyperkinesia), and lesions of the cerebellum result in incoordination of movement (e.g., ataxia). However, recent research has revealed that in addition to the primary motor cortex, the basal ganglia and cerebellum also demonstrate projection zones to the premotor cortex, frontal eye field , and prefrontal, inferotemporal, and posterior parietal cortices, suggesting a supplementary role for these structures (i.e., basal ganglia and cerebellum) in the regulation of cognitive processes. Subcortical cognitive deficits paralleling motor impairments such as difficulty in shifting attentional set and difficulty in coordinating mental activity have been described in the neuropsychological literature. However, correlates relative to hypolinguistic or dysmetric language processes are yet to be adequately defined. Aims: The aim of the current research, therefore, was to compare and contrast the language profiles of individuals with thalamic versus cerebellar lesions. Methods & Procedures: Two cases with surgically induced lesions of the left ventral intermediate thalamus, and two cases with spontaneous vascular infarcts in the left cerebellar hemisphere, served as experimental subjects in this research. General and high-level language profiles were compiled for each subject and performance compared to a roup of 16 non-neurologically impaired controls (NC). The criterion for anomalous performance was established as >= 2 SD below the NC group mean. Outcomes & Results : Evident deficits were largely restricted to complex language functions, irrespective of lesion type. Of note, however, was that thalamic lesions were associated with a higher overall proportion of significantly reduced test scores, as well as greater magnitudes of decline from normal when compared to cerebellar lesions. Conclusions: These results lend support to working theories of subcortical participation in language that promote a superordinate role for the thalamus in the regulation of higher-level lexical-semantic processes. Further more , the present findings also highlight the need to consider a novel role for the left cerebellar hemisphere in coordinating cognitive-linguistic systems.",nan; RHESUS-MONKEY; LANGUAGE; LESIONS; ORGANIZATION; DIASCHISIS; DEFICITS; THOUGHT

Neurons convergent for baroreceptor and nociceptive input have also been identified in the homologous anterior insula of the primate. Whether similar convergent cells exist in the ventrobasal thalamus was investigated in 30 urethane anesthetized male Sprague-Dawley rats. Six classes of cells were identified in the right ventrobasal thalamus: (a) 83/159 (52%) baroreceptive and nociceptive convergent units; (b) 2/159 (1%) convergent cells responding to baroreceptor activation and light touch; (c) 44/159 (28%) purely nociceptive units; (d)10/159 (6%) purely baroreceptive units; (e) 1/159 (0.6%) cells responding to brush alone and (f) 19/159 (12%) unresponsive units. Of the viscerosomatic convergent cells, 66/85 (78%) were situated in the ventroposterolateral nucleus (VPL), 6/85 (7%) in the ventroposterolateral parvicellular nucleus (VPLpc), and 13/85 (15%) in the ventroposteromedial nucleus (VPM). Fifteen right ventrobasal thalamic units were antidromically activated and 34 units orthodromically activated by right posterior insular microstimulation. Cobalt injection into the right ventrobasal thalamus blocked the right insular response to baroreceptor activation by > 70%. These data indicate: (a) baroreceptive and somatosensory nociceptive convergent units exist in the ventrobasal thalamus; (b) thalamic convergent neurons project directly to the ipsilateral posterior insula and receive reciprocal insulothalamic projections; and (c) a significant proportion of baroreceptor input relays to the posterior insula through the ipsilateral ventrobasal thalamus.

The thalamus receives extensive feedback from the cortex and this influences the firing pattern, synchronization and sensory response mode of relay cells. A crucial question concerns the extent to which the feedback simply controls the state and transmission mode of relay cells and the extent to which the feedback participates in the specific processing of sensory information. Using examples from experiments examining the influence of feedback from the visual cortex to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), we argue that thalamic mechanisms are selectively focused by visually driven feedback to optimize the thalamic contribution to segmentation and global integration. This involves effects on both the temporal and spatial parameters characterizing the responses of LGN cells and includes, for example, motion-driven feedback effects from MT (middle temporal visual area) relayed via layer 6 of V1 (primary visual cortex).",lateral geniculate nucleus; corticofugal feedback; primary visual cortex; middle temporal visual area; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; MACAQUE V1 NEURONS; STRIATE CORTEX; CORTICOFUGAL FEEDBACK; LAYER-VI; LAMINAR DISTRIBUTION; DYNAMIC PROPERTIES; SPATIAL SUMMATION; AREAS V1; CAT

In the earliest period analyzed, from 5-6 weeks of gestation, dorsal and ventral parts of the human thalamus were poorly differentiated structures forming the sides of the third ventricle. At 6 g.w., the prospective thalamic anlage consisted of the ventricular (VZ), the intermediate (IZ) and the marginal zones (MZ). The neurons in the VZ were bipolar and radially arranged to the ventricular surface. From 6-8 gestational weeks detached bipolar or branched bipolar cells with horizontal or oblique orientation were encountered in the IZ and occasionally in the MZ. In the period between 10-14 weeks of gestation, segregation of neurons into different thalamic nuclei began. The lateral geniculate nucleus, centrum medianum and mediodorsal nucleus were the first to be distinguished. In comparison with the previous period, the neurons throughout the rostro-caudal axis of the thalamus were more differentiated, with a higher number of primary dendrites that were often bifurcated. This resulted in various shapes of immature neurons: simple uni- and bipolar (type 1), branched uni- and bipolar (type 2) and young multipolar (type 3). In addition, the first spines were frequently observed on dendrites at 12 weeks of gestation. At 14-16 weeks of gestation, segregation of the neurons into thalamic nuclei continued. The neurons exhibited further dendritic differentiation that followed the caudo rostral gradient. For the first time, multipolar neurons, especially in the caudal part, could be sub-divided into two classes: multipolar with a 'bushy' appearance, the result of many primary dendrites with several bifurcations and 'simpler' multipolar neurons with fewer and less branched primary dendrites. Neuronal differentiation was further expressed by an increase in the total dendritic length and somatic surface, up to six and three times, respectively, from the earliest period analyzed to 16 weeks of gestation. Dendritic length increased initially by the formation of new primary branches and their elongation and secondly by formation of higher branch orders. At 16 g.w., a group of immature cells were observed dorsally, on the frontal sections through the rostral thalamus.

While both subcortical structures process information in basically segregated loops that primarily interact in the neocortex, direct subcortical interaction has been recently confirmed by neuroanatomical studies using viral transneuronal tracers in non-human primate brains. The thalamus is thought to be the main relay station of both projection systems. Yet, our understanding of subcortical basal ganglia and cerebellar interconnectivity within the human thalamus is rather sparse, primarily due to limitation in the acquisition of in vivo tracing. Consequently, we strive to characterize projections of both systems and their potential overlap within the human thalamus by diffusion MRI and tractography. Our analysis revealed a decreasing anterior-to-posterior gradient for pallido-thalamic connections in: (1) the ventral-anterior thalamus, (2) the intralaminar nuclei, and (3) midline regions. Conversely, we found a decreasing posterior-to-anterior gradient for dentato-thalamic projections predominantly in: (1) the ventral-lateral and posterior nucleus; (2) dorsal parts of the intralaminar nuclei and the subparafascicular nucleus, and (3) the medioventral and lateral mediodorsal nucleus. A considerable overlap of connectivity pattern was apparent in intralaminar nuclei and midline regions. Notably, pallidal and cerebellar projections were both hemispherically lateralized to the left thalamus. While strikingly consistent with findings from transneuronal studies in non-human primates as well as with pre-existing anatomical studies on developmentally expressed markers or pathological human brains, our assessment provides distinctive connectional fingerprints that illustrate the anatomical substrate of integrated functional networks between basal ganglia and the cerebellum. Thereby, our findings furnish useful implications for cerebellar contributions to the clinical symptomatology of movement disorders.",Cerebellum; Basal ganglia; Thalamus; Connectivity; Diffusion MRI; Hemispheric lateralization; CENTROMEDIAN-PARAFASCICULAR COMPLEX; GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; EFFERENT PROJECTIONS; ANATOMICAL ORGANIZATION; FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; MACACA-MULATTA; MOTOR CORTEX; NUCLEUS; CONNECTIONS

The inferior pulvinar (PI) complex consisted of multiple subdivisions and encompassed the classic PI, and adjacent ventral parts of the lateral and medial pulvinar (PL and Phl, respectively). In keeping with nomenclature suggested previously for macaques, the PI subdivisions were termed the posterior, medial, central, lateral, and lateral-shell (PIP, PIM, PIC, PIL, and PIL-S). In both species, PIP was intense for calbindin, light for acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and very light for Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) histochemistry. The PIM was calbindin poor, AChE rich, and moderate for WFA. The PIC was calbindin intense, lighter for AChE, and exhibited little WFA binding. PIL and PIL-S contained populations of large calbindin or WFA cells that were more numerous in PIL-S. Although staining with the monoclonal antibody Cat-301 differed between macaques and squirrel monkeys, the same subdivisions were displayed, Moderately dense, patchy Cat-301 stain was found in PIM of macaques, whereas in squirrel monkeys PIM was Light. Connections of the rostral dorsolateral (DLr) and middle temporal (MT) areas of visual cortex in squirrel monkeys were compared with PI subdivisions revealed by the neu er histochemical methods in the same cases. The major connections of DLr were with PIC and of MT were with PIM.

We studied the responsiveness of neurons in the primary motor cortex (MI) of monkeys (Macaca fuscata) to electrical stimulation of the supplementary motor area (SMA), primary sensory cortex (SI), and the ventral subnucleus of the thalamus (VPLo) with chronically implanted electrodes. 2. All neurons examined in this study were characterized by their relation to a motor task performed by the animals. They responded to stimulation of the cortical or thalamic area with excitation from one area alone (n = 128) or from multiple areas (n = 84) of all combinations. In a majority of neurons, response latencies to both cortical and thalamic stimulation were within 5 ms. 3. A vast majority of neurons (80%) that were active during a preparatory period for forthcoming reaching movements were activated by SMA stimulation. They were activated only infrequently by SI or thalamic stimulation. 4. Movement-related neurons(active immediately before and during reaching movements) were activated by thalamic, SI, or SMA stimulation or by any combination of those stimuli. More than half of the movement-related neurons activated exclusively by either thalamic or SMA stimulation exhibited activity onset times earlier than those observed in the earliest muscles. By contrast, most movement-related neurons that responded only to SI stimulation were late in their activity onset. 5. These findings suggest that the SMA input to MI is important in developing a preparatory type of activity in MI, whereas the thalamus (VPLo) provides substantial inputs in movement execution. The roles played by inputs from SI and SMA in relation to motor execution an debatable and are discussed here with reference to previous reports.",nan; PRIMARY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; CORTICO-CORTICAL CONNECTIONS; PROXIMAL FORELIMB MOVEMENTS; MACAQUE MONKEY; RHESUS-MONKEY; EFFERENT CONNECTIONS; GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; PARIETAL CORTEX; MACACA-MULATTA; THALAMIC INPUT

Thalamic infarcts in paramedian artery territory are seen fairly frequently owing to certain peculiarities of the vascularization of the thalamus. However, clinical diagnosis is usually difficult because of the many varieties and peculiarities of the symptomatology. Material and Methods. We present a review of twelve cases of bilateral paramedian infarcts of the thalamus seen in our Department of Neurology and in a private surgery. We analyze the symptoms and their relationship to the neuro-radiological findings. Finally we compare our observations with the descriptions published by other authors and seek an anatomo-functional relationship for each of the symptoms and signs observed. Results. The usual clinical outline in our patients included disorders of consciousness, different types of oculomotor disorders and cerebellar symptoms, mainly of gait. Other less common findings were memory disorders and abnormal movements. In no case were there sensory changes and pyramidal signs were rare in the absence of significant extra-thalamic lesions. Conclusions. Our findings, although generally comparable to those described in the literature consulted, were somewhat different with regard to cerebellar symptoms arm the absence of sensory and pyramidal signs. We also emphasize the marked differences seen between the individual patients in our series. A good knowledge of the possible clinical variants of these lesions is necessary for a correct initial diagnostic approach in the study of these patients [REVNEUROL 1997, 25. 1353-62].",amnesia; ataxia; disorder of consciousness; eye movement; ictus; infarct; paramedian artery; thalamus; FRONTAL-LOBE; COMMUNICATING ARTERY; DIENCEPHALIC AMNESIA; EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; RHESUS-MONKEY; MIDBRAIN; MEMORY; DISORDERS; LESIONS; NUCLEUS

Small injections of biotinylated dextran amine were placed in the ventral parts of dentate nuclei. The distribution of all contralateral terminal fields in the thalamus was charted, and representative individual axons that terminated in the VL were traced in serial sections under the light microscope. These axons were reconstructed with all their branches and terminal fields in the thalamus. The geometry and size of the terminal fields as well as the number and distribution of boutons and neurons in them were analyzed. The terminal fields of all labeled axons were distributed widely over the VL either singly or in clusters. Two types of axons were found: simple axons formed only one terminal field and complex axons formed multiple terminal fields at a distance. Individual terminal fields were focal, had the form of flattened discs, and generated up to 200 boutons distributed between 10 and 29 nerve cell bodies. These findings suggest that a simple axon activates a small group of neurons at one site. The complex axons, in turn, influence similar size cell groups at different VL locations. The total number of boutons generated by a single complex axon was up to 300. Future studies should determine whether simple axons could be branches of complex axons that took off below the thalamus. The results reveal a complex organization of the input from the ventral dentate to the VL that only partially fits into the traditional concept of somatotopic organization of the nucleus.

Brain tissue from macaques was immunoreacted by means of antibodies to choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) or to histamine and processed for light and electron microscopy. A dense plexus of thin, highly branched ChAT-immunoreactive axons laden with varicosities was found in all layers of the dLGN including the koniocellular laminae and in the pregeniculate nucleus. ChAT label was more dense in magnocellular layers 1 and 2 than in parvocellular layers 3-6 and relatively sparse in the interlaminar zones. Varicosities associated with the cholinergic axons had an average of three conventional asymmetric synapses per varicosity, and these appeared to contact dendrites of both thalamocortical cells and interneurons. Histamine-immunoreactive axons were distributed homogeneously throughout all laminar and interlaminar zones of the dLGN, but mere denser in the pregeniculate nucleus than in the dLGN. Histaminergic axons branched infrequently and were typically larger in caliber than cholinergic axons. The overwhelming majority of varicosities were found en passant and rarely displayed conventional synapses, despite the abundance of synaptic vesicles, and were not associated preferentially with specific cellular structures. The innervation of the macaque dLGN complex by cholinergic and histaminergic systems is consistent with their proposed role in state dependent modulation of thalamic activity. The dense and highly synaptic innervation by cholinergic axons supports the proposal of additional involvement of these axons in functions related to eye movements. Anat Rec 255:295-305, 1999.

Here, we quantified and compared the sources of thalamic input to electrophysiologically-identified hand/forearm-related regions of several PPC areas, namely areas 5v, AIP, PFG, and PF, of the capuchin monkey (Sapajus sp). We found that these areas receive most of their thalamic connections from the Anterior Pulvinar (PuA), Lateral Posterior (LP) and Medial Pulvinar (PuM) nuclei. Each PPC area receives a specific combination of projections from these nuclei, and fewer additional projections from other nuclei. Moreover, retrograde labeling of the cells innervating different PPC areas revealed substantial intermingling of these cells within the thalamus. Differences in thalamic input may contribute to the different functional properties displayed by the PPC areas. Furthermore, the observed innervation of functionally-related PPC domains from partly intermingled thalamic cell populations accords with the notion that higher-order thalamic inputs may dynamically regulate functional connectivity between cortical areas.",Anterior intraparietal area; area 5; area 7; lateral posterior thalamic nucleus; pulvinar; VENTRAL PREMOTOR AREAS; MACAQUE MONKEY; RHESUS-MONKEY; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; VISUAL GUIDANCE; NEW-WORLD; THALAMOCORTICAL PROJECTIONS; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; LAMINAR DISTRIBUTION; FRONTAL-CORTEX

Biotin dextran amine was iontophoretically injected into different parts of the substantia nigra pars reticulata of monkeys (African green monkeys and macaques). In whatever part of the substantia nigra the injection was made, numerous axonal endings were found to be distributed within different thalamic regions: the ventral anterior nucleus and mainly its magnocellular part, the most ventromedial part of the ventral lateral nucleus, and the mediodorsal and parafascicular nuclei. Moreover, the nigrothalamic projection appeared to be topographically organized. Ten anterogradely labeled axons were reconstructed from serial sections. The axons terminated in three to six terminal fields per axon located in a relatively small portion of only one thalamic region. These terminal fields were variable in size and comprised 4-43 very thin, varicose branches. They consisted either of different axonal branches of the same axon or of different axons and covered 10-31 thalamic cell bodies. These findings demonstrate that the overall morphological organization of individual nigral axons is complex and allows single axons to influence thalamic neurons via a combination of divergent, convergent, and amplification processes.

We emphasize that the cerebellar thalamus deserves a renewal of interest to better understand its specific contributions to the cerebellar motor and associative functions, especially at a time where the anatomy between cerebellum and basal ganglia is being rewritten.",Cerebellum; Thalamus; Movement; Spike; Burst; Rebound; Cognition; Tremor; Inverse model; Dynamical system; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL SULCUS; STATE FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BASAL GANGLIA; CEREBELLOTHALAMIC PATHWAY; RETICULAR NUCLEUS; CORTICAL NETWORKS; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; DENTATE NUCLEUS; MACACA-FUSCATA; MOTOR THALAMUS

Although CYPIBI protein is known to metabolize estradiol to catecholestrogens in the uterus. its localization and function in brain have not yet been described. To better understand CYPIBI distribution, we have combined in situ hybridization (ISH) for its mRNA with immunohistochemistry (IHC) for the CYPIBI protein in selected brain regions of male and female adult rhesus monkey mulatta). Blocks of formalin-fixed tissue obtained from the frontal cortex, hippocampus. thalamus, and amygdala were processed and embedded in paraffin.

In contrast, although CYPIBI protein was co-localized with its mRNA in the female brains, it was primarily restricted to hippocampal pyramidal neurons in the male brains.

Competing theories that attempt to explain consciousness disagree on the contribution of frontal versus posterior cortex and omit subcortical influences. This lack of understanding impedes the ability to monitor consciousness, which can lead to adverse clinical consequences. To test substrates and measures of consciousness, we recorded simultaneously from frontal cortex, parietal cortex, and subcortical structures, the striatum and thalamus, in awake, sleeping, and anesthetized macaques. We manipulated consciousness on a finer scale using thalamic stimulation, rousing macaques from continuously administered anesthesia. Our results show that, unlike measures targeting complexity, a measure additionally capturing neural integration (Phi*) robustly correlated with changes in consciousness. Machine learning approaches show parietal cortex, striatum, and thalamus contributed more than frontal cortex to decoding differences in consciousness. These findings highlight the importance of integration between parietal and subcortical structures and challenge a key role for frontal cortex in consciousness.",nan; FRONTAL EYE FIELDS; INTRALAMINAR NUCLEI; AUDITORY-STIMULI; SPATIAL NEGLECT; CORTICAL AREAS; VISUAL-CORTEX; PERCEPTION; MACAQUE; MECHANISMS; AFFERENTS

In order to compare these with histologically demonstrated connections of the PPN in monkeys, and thus to Support the use of PDT in humans, we have carried out PDT in a fixed rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) brain. Probabilistic diffusion tractography was carried out in a fixed post-mortem rhesus monkey brain using diffusion data acquired at 3T MRI (60 directions x 5 averages, b = 3000 s/mm(2), matrix size = 104 x 132 x 96, 720 x 720 x 720 mu m voxels). We identified the major connections of the PPN from single seed voxels that could be confidently located within the nucleus on the diffusion images. The organisation of these connections within a 3 x 3 x 3 voxel (similar to 10 mm(3)) region surrounding the initial seed voxel was then examined. PDT confirmed that the rhesus monkey PPN connections with the basal ganglia and motor cortical areas matched those previously demonstrated using conventional anatomical tracing techniques. Furthermore, although the Organisation Of subcortical connections within the PPN has not been extensively demonstrated in animals, we show here in a rhesus monkey that there are clearly separated connections of the PPN with the thalamus, substantia nigra, and subthalamic nucleus. Thus, in addition to increasing confidence in the accuracy of PDT for tracing PPN connections and determining the Organisation of these connections within the PPN in vivo, our observations suggest that diffusion tractography will be a useful new technique to rapidly identify connections in animal brains pre-mortem and post-mortem.

However, mapping the neuronal projections with individual-axon resolution in the large and complex primate brain is still challenging. Herein, we describe a highly efficient pipeline for three-dimensional mapping of the entire macaque brain with subcellular resolution. The pipeline includes a novel poly-N-acryloyl glycinamide (PNAGA)based embedding method for long-term structure and fluorescence preservation, high-resolution and rapid whole-brain optical imaging, and image post-processing. The cytoarchitectonic information of the entire macaque brain was acquired with a voxel size of 0.32 gm x 0.32 gm x 10 gm, showing its anatomical structure with cell distribution, density, and shape. Furthermore, thanks to viral labeling, individual long-distance projection axons from the frontal cortex were for the first time reconstructed across the entire brain hemisphere with a voxel size of 0.65 gm x 0.65 gm x 3 gm. Our results show that individual cortical axons originating from the prefrontal cortex simultaneously target multiple brain regions, including the visual cortex, striatum, thalamus, and midbrain. This pipeline provides an efficient method for cellular and circuitry investigation of the whole macaque brain with individual-axon resolution, and can shed light on brain function and disorders.

Those terminals forming type I synapses appear to arise from relay nuclei in the thalamus, whereas those forming type II synapses derive from cortical local circuit neurons. However, whether PV is present in both of these two types of terminals in the association regions of the primate prefrontal cortex (PFC) is not known. In the present study, PV-immunoreactive (IR) axon terminals in the superficial layers (layers 2-3a) of monkey PFC area 9 were found to form exclusively type II synapses onto the dendritic spines (44%), shafts (39%), or somata/axon initial segments (17%) of pyramidal neurons. In contrast, in the middle layers (layers 3b-4), 52% of the PV-IR axon terminals formed type I synapses, and 79% of these terminals contacted dendritic spines. However, in the adjacent area 46, only 12% of the PV-IR terminals in the middle layers formed type I synapses. In addition, the PV-IR axon terminals forming type I synapses were 50% larger than those terminals forming type II synapses. Similar to the macaque monkey, in area 9 of the human PFC, PV-IR axon terminals forming type I synapses onto dendritic spines were found in the middle layers. These findings indicate that PV-IR axon terminals in macaque monkey and human PFC are likely to have both intrinsic and extrinsic sources. In addition, the laminar, regional, and target specificity of the labeled terminals forming type I synapses suggests that they arise from PV-IR neurons in the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus.

This seems incompatible with the hypothesis that cells of the subplate (the lower component of the preplate in normal mammals) form an axonal scaffold that guides thalamic fibers and act as temporary targets for them (Blakemore and Molnar, 1990, Shatz et at., 1990). We used carbocyanine dyes to trace projections in wild-type and reeler mice between embryonic day 13 and postnatal day 3. Preplate formation and early extension of corticofugal fibers to form a topographic array are indistinguishable in the two phenotypes. So too are the emergence of thalamic axons in topographic order through the primitive internal capsule, their meeting with preplate axons, and their distribution over the preplate scaffold. Distinctive differences appear after the cortical plate begins to accumulate below the preplate of reeler, causing the preplate axons to form oblique fascicles, running through the cortical plate. Thalamic axons then pass through the plate within the same fascicles and accumulate in the superplate layer for similar to 2-3 d, before defasciculating and plunging down to terminate deep in the cortical plate, creating the curious looping pattern seen in the adult. Thus, thalamocortical innervation in reeler follows the same algorithm of development but in relation to the misplaced population of early-born neurons. Far from challenging the theory that preplate fibers guide thalamic axons, reeler provides strong evidence for it.",cortex; reeler; development; pioneer axons; preplate; handshake hypothesis; thalamus; mouse; subplate; axon guidance; infernal capsule; DEVELOPING CEREBRAL-CORTEX; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; SUBPLATE NEURONS; ADHESION MOLECULES; TARGET SELECTION; EARLY INGROWTH; RHESUS-MONKEY; NEOCORTEX; MICE; RAT

Single or paired injections of anterogradely transported tracers, of varying anteroposterior extent, were made horizontally from behind in defined parts of the body representation in the ventral posterior lateral (VPL) and/or ventral posterior medial (VPM) thalamic nuclei, and the distribution and density of labeled thalamocortical terminations were mapped in cortex. injections of increasing size in any dimension of VPL or VPM resulted in increasing accumulation of labeled terminals within the region of projection, implying extensive convergence of individual axons. Anteroposteriorly elongated injections labeled mediolaterally extended but anteroposteriorly restricted zones in cortex. Dorsoventral placement of an injection in VPL or VPM determined anteroposterior location of labeling in cortex. Dual injections separated mediolaterally or dorsoventrally by similar to 1 mm, and in different parts of the thalamic body or head-face representation gave rise to labeled thalamocortical terminations that overlapped extensively. For injection sites at different anteroposterior levels in VPL or VPM, the area of cortical convergence was related to their extent of anteroposterior coincidence. Labeled terminations arising from injections in immediately adjacent parts of VPL and VPM did not overlap in cortex. The extent of thalamocortical divergence and convergence revealed by these experiments is greater than that predictable from labeling of single axons and is sufficiently great to account for representational plasticity that exceeds the 1.5 mm cortical distance limit..",ventral posterior nucleus; area 3b; cortical plasticity; somatotopic representation; Phaseolus vulgaris; leukoagglutinin; fluorescent dextrans; FUNCTIONAL REORGANIZATION; MACACA-FASCICULARIS; MACAQUE MONKEYS; AREA 3B; TOPOGRAPHIC REORGANIZATION; CORTICAL REORGANIZATION; AFFERENT TERMINATIONS; THALAMIC REGION; ADULT MACAQUES; NERVE INJURY

Here, we collected resting-state functional and diffusion-weighted MRI data before and after male rhesus macaque monkeys received extensive training to learn novel visuospatial discriminations (reward-guided learning). We found functional connectivity changes in orbitofrontal, ventromedial prefrontal, inferotemporal, entorhinal, retrosplenial, and anterior cingulate cortices, the subicular complex, and the dorsal, medial thalamus. These corticocortical and thalamocortical changes in functional connectivity were accompanied by related white matter structural alterations in the uncinate fasciculus, fornix, and ventral prefrontal tract: tracts that connect (sub)cortical networks and are implicated in learning and memory processes in monkeys and humans. After the well-trained monkeys received fornix transection, they were impaired in learning new visuospatial discriminations. In addition, the functional connectivity profile that was observed after the training was altered. These changes were accompanied by white matter changes in the ventral prefrontal tract, although the integrity of the uncinate fasciculus remained unchanged.

In the oculomotor delayed-response (ODR) task, monkeys needed to make a memory-guided saccade to the cue location, whereas in the rotatory oculomotor delayed-response (R-ODR) task, they needed to make a memory-guided saccade 90(o) clockwise from the cue direction. The directions of population vectors calculated from populations of cue- and response-period activities were similar to the cue and saccade target directions, respectively, which confirmed that population vectors represent information regarding the directions of the visual cue and the saccade target. We then calculated population vectors of delay-period activity using a sliding 250-ms time window. In the ODR task, population vectors were directed toward the cue direction throughout the delay. However, in the R-ODR task, they gradually rotated from the cue direction to the saccade target direction. Based on a comparison with the results obtained from DLPFC neurons, the rotation of population vectors started earlier in the MD than in the DLPFC, suggesting that the motor information regarding forthcoming saccade is provided from the MD.",information processing; population vector; prefrontal cortex; rhesus monkey; thalamus; working memory; SPATIAL WORKING-MEMORY; FREE ARM MOVEMENTS; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; MOTOR CORTICAL ACTIVITY; BRAIN-STEM TELLS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; 3-DIMENSIONAL SPACE; VISUAL TARGETS; FRONTAL-LOBE

An important contributor to normal sleep patterns is a low-threshold calcium current mediated by T-type calcium channels. The T-type calcium current underlies burst responses in thalamic nuclei that are important to spindle propagation, and we recently observed that this current is sensitive to acute low doses of ethanol. Methods: We used a combination of current clamp and voltage clamp recordings in an in vitro brain slice preparation of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of macaque monkeys that have chronically self-administered ethanol to determine whether chronic ethanol exposure may affect T-type currents. Results: Current clamp recordings from the LGN of ethanol naive macaques showed characteristic burst responses. However, recordings from the LGN in macaques that self-administered ethanol revealed a significant attenuation of bursts across a range of voltages (n = 5). Voltage clamp recordings from control LGN neurons (n = 16) and neurons (n = 29) from brain slices from chronically drinking macaques showed no significant differences (P > 0.05) in T-type current kinetics or in the membrane resistance of the thalamic cells between the two cohorts. However, mean T-type current amplitude measured in the chronically drinking animals was reduced by 31% (P < 0.01). Conclusions: We conclude that chronic ethanol self-administration reduces calcium currents in thalamic relay cells without altering underlying current kinetics, which may provide a mechanistic framework for the well-documented disruptions in sleep/wake behavior in subjects with chronic ethanol exposure.

A central origin of tremor could arise either from a rhythmic activity of the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) or from a structure such as the thalamus, outside the basal ganglia. In this study, single-unit recordings were performed in three 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-treated monkeys within the GPi and within three territories of the motor thalamus (delimited by their afferent inputs from the GPi, the substantia nigra and the cerebellum, respectively). For each recorded neuron, we compared the variations in firing rate and pattern in tremor and no tremor periods. Tremor either occurred spontaneously or was induced by external stimulation. When the animals entered into a tremor period we observed: (i) an increase in the mean firing rate in about half of the recorded neurons of the motor thalamus; and (ii), a change from an irregular to a rhythmic discharge within the range of tremor frequency (5-7 Hz) in about 10% of the recorded neurons of the motor thalamus (pallidal and cerebellar territories) and the GPi. Most of the thalamic neurons that exhibited a rhythmic discharge during tremor were found to be sensitive to external stimulation. Because the changes in firing rate occurred predominantly in the motor thalamus and not in the GPi, and because a fast rhythmic discharge of 10-15 Hz was frequently observed in the GPi and not in the motor thalamus, we conclude that thalamic activity is not a simple reproduction of basal ganglia output. Moreover, we suggest that thalamic processing of basal ganglia outputs could participate in the genesis of tremor, and that this thalamic processing could be influenced by sensory inputs and/or changes in attentional level elicited by external stimulation.",GPi; Parkinson; primate; thalamus; tremor; PRIMATE SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; SINGLE-UNIT ANALYSIS; GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; BASAL GANGLIA; OCULAR MICROTREMOR; RESTING TREMOR; MACACA-FUSCATA; SPIKE TRAINS; 2 PARTS; DISEASE

However, recent findings suggest that behavioral patterns can be delineated on the basis of the four main arterial thalamic territories. The anterior pattern consists mainly of perseverations and superimposition of unrelated information, apathy, and amnesia. After paramedian infarct, the most frequent features are disinhibition syndromes, with personality changes, loss of self-activation, amnesia, and, in the case of extensive lesions, thalamic dementia; this pattern may often be difficult to distinguish from primary psychiatric disorders, especially when neurologic dysfunction is lacking. After inferolateral lesion, executive dysfunction may develop but is often overlooked, although it may occasionally lead to severe long-term disability. After posterior lesion, whereas cognitive dysfunction with neglect and aphasia are well known, no specific behavioral syndrome has been reported. In the future, perfusion CT, functional MRI, and tractography using diffusion imaging in stroke patients may provide a better understanding of the role of the corticothalamic relationship in behavioral changes associated with thalamic stroke.",nan; PSYCHIC SELF-ACTIVATION; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; CORTICOTHALAMIC CONNECTIONS; BITHALAMIC INFARCTION; COMMUNICATING ARTERY; MEDIODORSAL NUCLEUS; LEFT-HEMISPHERE; AMNESIA; MEMORY

Recovered, vs. nonrecovered, patients showed an enhanced ipsileisonal thalamic-contralesional cerebellar metabolic interdependency. This pattern correctly classified 91% of recovered and 88% of nonrecovered patients. Metabolic interactions involving bilateral supplementary motor area, ipsilesional thalamus, and contralesional cerebellum distinguished all recovered patients from age/sex-matched controls (N = 12).

A number of physiological studies have demonstrated that this projection causes a dramatic change in thalamic activity during the transition from sleep to wakefulness. Additionally, the PER may mediate more subtle changes in thalamic activity as attentional levels fluctuate during the waking state. The synaptic circuitry underlying these events has been identified in the cat thalamus. However, there is currently no anatomical information regarding the distribution of cholinergic receptors in relation to this circuitry To begin to understand how the PER projection modulates thalamic activity, we used immunocytochemical techniques to examine the distribution of muscarinic type 2 (M2) receptors in the visual thalamus of the cat. The distribution of M2 receptors correlates well with previous reports of the distribution of cholinergic terminals in the visual thalamus. At the light microscopic level, dense M2 staining was seen in the neuropil of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and pulvinar nucleus and in somata and proximal dendrites of cells in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). In the dLGN and pulvinar nucleus, we quantitatively analyzed the distribution of M2 receptors using electron microscopy. Postembedding immunocytochemistry for gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) was used to determine whether M2 receptors are present on interneurons or thalamocortical cells. In particular, we examined the distribution of M2 receptors with respect to the known sites of PER terminations. The dendrites of both thalamocortical cells and interneurons were stained for the M2 receptors in both the glomerular and extraglomerular neuropil. However, the densest staining was found in glomerular GABAergic profiles that displayed the morphology associated with interneuron dendritic terminals (F2 profiles). Our data suggest that M2 receptors play an important role both in blocking thalamic spindle oscillations and in increasing the efficacy of signal transmission during increased attentional states.

Monkey specific 5HT1A (432 bp), 2A (411 bp) and 2C (294 bp) receptor probes were generated with PCR. Moderate 5HT1A receptor hybridization signal was detected in the preoptic area and the ventromedial nuclei. Less intense 5HT1A receptor signal was detected in a contiguous area from the dorsomedial nuclei through the posterior hypothalamus and in the supramammillary area. There was no change in 5HT1A receptor hybridization signal in any area with ovarian steroid treatment. Dense 5HT2A receptor hybridization signal was morphologically confined to the paraventricular, supraoptic, and mammillary nuclei and the external capsule of the thalamus.

In summary, macaque 5HT1A, 2A and 2C receptor mRNAs are located in distinct hypothalamic loci which play a role in a number of autonomic functions and behavior. Ovarian steroids decreased the expression of 5HT2C receptor mRNA in the ventromedial nuclei, dorsal and posterior hypothalamus. The expression of 5HT1A and 5HT2A receptor mRNA was not altered by treatment with ovarian steroids. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

After HRP injections into the head of the caudate nucleus we found retrogradely labelled neurons mainly in the intralaminar nuclei (nc. paracentralis, nc. centralis lateralis, nc. parafascicularis) and in the midline nuclei (nc. parataenialis, nc. centralis pars densocellularis, nc. centralis superior, nc. centralis intermedialis, nc. centralis inferior, nc. reuniens). Some labelled neurons were seen in the anterior thalamic nuclei (nc. anterodorsalis, nc. anteromedialis, nc. anteroventralis). In the ventral thalamus labelled neurons were seen in the nc. ventralis anterior (pars magnocellularis) and in the nc. ventralis lateralis (pars medialis). Some labelled neurons were distributed in the marginal parts of the nc. mediodorsalis. As for the caudal portion of the thalamus, labelled neurons were found in the nc. pulvinaris medialis and nc. limitans. The thalamocaudate projection is an exclusively ipsilateral projection system.

The DCS is of interest because of its role in directed attention and recovery from multimodal hemispatial neglect following cortical lesions of medial agranular cortex (AGm), an association area that is its major source of cortical input. A key finding was that the multimodal posterior parietal cortex (PPC) also contributes substantial input to DCS. This is significant because PPC and AGm are linked by corticocortical connections and are both critical components of the circuitry involved in spatial processing and directed attention. Other cortical areas providing input to DCS include visual association areas, lateral agranular cortex and orbital cortex. These areas also have reciprocal connections with AGm and PPC. Less consistent labeling was seen in somatic sensorimotor areas FL, HL and Par 1. Thalamic afferents to DCS are prominent from the intralaminar, ventrolateral, mediodorsal, ventromedial, laterodorsal (LD) and lateral posterior (LP) nuclei. Collectively, these nuclei constitute the sources of thalamic input to cortical areas AGm, and PPC. Nuclei LD and LP are only labeled with injections in dorsal DCS, the site of major input from PPC, and PPC receives its thalamic input from LD and LP. We conclude that DCS receives inputs from cortical and thalamic areas that are themselves linked by corticocortical and thalamocortical connections. These findings support the hypothesis that DCS is a key component of an associative network of cortical, striatal and thalamic regions involved in multimodal processing and directed attention.

In 75% of the trials the visual cue correctly indicated which of the 2 acoustic signals would follow. In 25% of the trials the visual cue was misleading, readying for the wrong acoustic signal. Based on the visual cue the monkey could anticipate which acoustic signal would be presented, a possibility confirmed by behavioural analysis. Movements conforming with the acoustic instruction signals were reinforced. The activity of 65 medial geniculate nucleus (MGN) and 107 primary auditory cortex (Acx) neurons was recorded during task performance. Significant response differences to anticipated vs unanticipated acoustic signals were found in 32% of the MGN and 27% of the ACx neurons. In both structures some of the affected neurons responded more vigorously to the correctly anticipated acoustic signals while others responded more vigorously to the unanticipated ones. An index of relative response intensity (RRI) was derived for each neuron by comparing its response to the sound signal in reinforced trials with that obtained in trials with no visual cues and no reinforcement (a 'blank' condition). For both MGN and ACx the analysis of RRIs revealed two anticipation-related effects. One consisted of response facilitation to anticipated sound signals together with suppression of responses to unanticipated sound signals. The other consisted of facilitation of responses to unanticipated sound signals, combined with base-line responsiveness to anticipated sounds. These effects can be interpreted to reflect a context-relevant trial by trial selection of neuronal channels which conduct information along the thalamocortical segment of the auditory system. The similarity between the effects of anticipation at the thalamic and the cortical levels suggest that the changes in excitability which underlay trial by trial neuronal selectivity occur subcortically.",nan; PRINCIPAL CELLS; BODY; CAT; ATTENTION; MODULATION; POTENTIALS; RESPONSES; COMPLEX; BRAIN

Post-mortem anatomic studies have rarely investigated the thalamus in this population. Methods: Postmortem tissue was obtained from the left hemisphere of eight male schizophrenic patients and eight male age-matched control subjects, The optical dissector stereologic procedure was used to count neurons in the mediodorsal (MD) and anteroventral/anteromedial (AV/AM) nuclei of the thalamus. Results: The number of neurons and volume of the MD were significantly reduced by 35% and 24%, respectively. The MD cell number reduction was a consistent finding; every control subject had more and every schizophrenic subject had fewer than 3.5 million neurons. Neuron number was also significantly reduced (16%) in the AV/AM nuclei. Conclusions: The present data indicate that schizophrenia is associated with robust reductions in nerve cell numbers in nuclei that communicate with the prefrontal cortex and limbic system. These thalamic anatomic deficits may be responsible, in part, for previous reports of such prefrontal cortical abnormalities as reduced synaptic density, reduced volume, and metabolic hypofunction.

It has been proposed that this circuit is involved in signal processing and thalamic sensitivity regulation. Alternatively, Crick has suggested that the circuit could be a reverberatory loop--a site for very short term (iconic) visual memory. This hypothesis is shown to be plausible if the reverberation is keyed to the onset of neurally initiated visual disruptions such as blinks and saccades. Neural mechanisms suppress perception during these events but little is known about temporal filling-in processes analogous to the mechanisms that fill-in spatial scotomas. Crick's reverberatory loop could provide a process for filling-in temporal scotomas with information acquired just before the disruption, thus maintaining the continuity of visual experience.

However, little is known about possible structural alterations following amputation and chronic loss of afferent input in humans. Using voxel-based morphometry (VBM), based on high-resolution magnetic resonance images, we investigated the brain structure of 28 volunteers with unilateral limb amputation and compared them to healthy controls. Subjects with limb amputation exhibited a decrease in gray matter of the posterolateral thalamus contralateral to the side of the amputation. The thalamic gray matter differences were positively correlated with the time span after the amputation but not with the frequency or magnitude of coexisting phantom pain. Phantom limb pain was unrelated to thalamic structural variations, but was positively correlated to a decrease in brain areas related to the processing of pain. No gray matter increase was detected. The unilateral thalamic differences may reflect a structural correlate of the loss of afferent input as a secondary change following deafferentation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Efferent fibres from both nuclei project predominantly to areas of the thalamus, which in turn project to the motor cortex, In this study, single and double anterograde-tracing techniques have been used to examine and compare the pathways from the lateral and interposed nuclei to the thalamus in the rat by using both light and electron microscopy to look for evidence of organisational or structural features that may underlie the proposed functional differences between these nuclei. Terminals from the lateral nucleus were found to be located most medially in the thalamus, predominantly in the ventral lateral nucleus and the rostral pole of the posterior nuclear group. Terminals from the posterior interposed nucleus were located slightly rostral and lateral to those from the lateral nucleus, mainly around the border between the ventral lateral nucleus and the ventral posterior medial nucleus. Terminals from the anterior interposed nucleus were located slightly rostral and lateral to those from the posterior interposed nucleus, predominantly in the rostral pole of the ventral posterior lateral nucleus. Terminals from the lateral and interposed nuclei were also found in double anterograde-tracing experiments to be nonoverlapping in the regions between these main areas of termination. The structure of terminals from the lateral and interposed nuclei, however, as well as their synaptic relationship with thalamic neurones, were found to be similar. The terminals are large and form synapses with proximal dendrites of thalamic neurones. They contained round vesicles and formed multiple synaptic contacts with dendritic shafts, as well as dendritic spines. The findings indicate that information from the lateral and interposed nuclei is processed in separate regions of the thalamus but that the mode of synaptic transfer to thalamic neurones is likely to be similar for the two projections.

Methods: Twenty-six patients with mTLE who underwent anterior temporal lobectomy were included. Post-operatively, 13 patients became completely seizure-free and 13 showed residual seizure, regardless of frequency (five patients became almost seizure-free, six had rare seizures and two showed significant improvements). Degrees of hypometabolism in bilateral thalamus, ipsilateral medial and lateral temporal lobes were evaluated visually and semi-quantitatively by determining the asymmetry index (AI), a value indicating 100 x (ipsilateral-contralateral)/[1/2x ( ipsilateral + contralateral)] and the region-to-cerebral hemisphere ratio (R/C ratio) being the ratio between averaged counts in each area and those in the cerebral hemisphere of the same side. Results: Hypometabolism in the medial temporal lobe was visually observed in all patients. Hypometabolism in the lateral temporal lobe was observed in 20 patients and was semiquantitatively more prominent than that of the medial temporal lobe. Pathologically, hippocampal sclerosis and prominent astrogliosis of the lateral temporal lobe were present in all cases. However, while thalamic hypometabolism was visually observed in nine patients (in the ipsilateral side of four cases, contralateral side of three and on both sides of two), no significant thalamic hypometabolism was semi-quantitatively observed. No significant differences in metabolic rate in any area except for the lateral temporal lobe between seizure-free patients and residual seizure patients were seen semi-quantitatively. Discussion: Data indicated that metabolism in the lateral temporal lobe of patients with mTLE significantly decreased and revealed pathologic glial changes.

Schizophrenia is associated with reductions in thalamic neuronal number and cortical gray matter volume. Exposure of nonhuman primates to x-irradiation in early gestation has previously been shown to decrease thalamic volume and neuronal number. Here we examine whether early gestational irradiation also results in cortical volume reduction. Methods: High-resolution, T1-weighted magnetic resonance scans were collected in adult monkeys 1) exposed to irradiation during the early gestational period (E33-E42) corresponding to thalamic neurogenesis, 2) irradiated in midgestation (E70-81) during neocortical neurogenesis, and 3) not exposed to irradiation. Cortical gray matter and white matter volumes were derived via manual segmentation, frontal and nonfrontal volumes were distinguisbed via sulcal landmarks. Results: Monkeys irradiated in early gestation exhibited a trend reduction in nonfrontal gray matter volume (17%) and significant reductions in white matter volume in frontal (26%) and nonfrontal (36%) lobes. Monkeys irradiated in midgestation had smaller gray (frontal 28%; nonfrontal. 22% and white matter (frontal 29%; nonfrontal- 38%) volumes. Conclusions: The cortical deficits observed in midgestationally irradiated monkeys are consistent with a reduction in cortical neuronal number. Cortical volume reductions following early gestational irradiation may be secondary to reduced thalamic neuronal number and therefore model the thalamocortical pathology of schizophrenia.",frontal; magnetic resonance; neurogenesis; schizophrenia; thalamus; SCHIZOPHRENIA SPECTRUM DISORDERS; DYNAMIC-PROGRAMMING GENERATION; FIRST-EPISODE SCHIZOPHRENIA; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; RHESUS-MONKEY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MEDIODORSAL NUCLEUS; TWINS DISCORDANT; VISUAL-CORTEX; OBSTETRIC COMPLICATIONS

They usually established several synaptic contacts - often in complex glomerulus-like synaptic arrangements - with dendritic shafts of large diameter and presynaptic dendrites containing pleomorphic vesicles. Postsynaptic targets of the PHAL-labelled CT boutons were characterized by postembedding gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) immunocytochemistry. It appeared that, in the LP1 of the cat, almost half (44.5%) of the postsynaptic dendrites to CT boutons from area 17 belonged to the GABA-immunopositive interneurons and the majority (41%) of these GABA-immunopositive dendrites were F2 terminals.

Lamina I terminations were identified by anterograde labeling with biotinylated dextran, and 109 boutons on 38 terminal fibers were closely studied in series of ultrathin sections. Five unlabeled terminal boutons of similar appearance were also examined in detail. Three-dimensional, volume-rendered computer models were reconstructed from complete series of serial sections for 29 boutons on 10 labeled terminal fibers and one unlabeled terminal fiber. In addition, postembedding immunogold staining for GABA was obtained in alternate sections through 23 boutons. Lamina I TSTT terminations in VMpo generally have several large boutons (mean length = 2.16 mum, mean width = 1.29 mum) that are densely packed with vesicles and make asymmetric synaptic contacts on low-order dendrites of VMpo neurons (mean diameter 1.45 mum). They are closely associated with GABAergic presynaptic dendrites (PSDs), and nearly all form classic triadic arrangements (28 of 29 reconstructed boutons). Consecutive boutons on individual terminal fibers make multiple contacts with a single postsynaptic dendrite and can show evidence of progressive complexity. Dendritic appendages that enwrap and invaginate the terminal bouton constitute additional anatomic evidence for secure, high-fidelity synaptic transfer. These observations provide direct ultrastructural evidence supporting the hypothesis that VMpo is a lamina I TSTT thalamocortical relay nucleus in primates that subserves pain, temperature, itch, and other sensations related to the physiological condition of the body.

Thalamic afferent terminals are preferentially labeled by an isoform of the vesicular glutamate transporter, VGluT2. The goal of our study was to determine the distribution of VGluT2-ir puncta in macaque and human visual cortex. First, we investigated the distribution of VGluT2-ir puncta in all layers of macaque monkey primary visual cortex (V1), and found a very close correspondence between the known distribution of LGN afferents from previous studies and the distribution of VGluT2-immunoreactive (-ir) puncta. There was also a close correspondence between cytochrome oxidase density and VGluT2-ir puncta distribution. After validating the correspondence in macaque, we made a comparative study in human V1. In many aspects, the distribution of VGluT2-ir puncta in human was qualitatively similar to that of the macaque: high densities in layer 4C, patches of VGluT2-ir puncta in the supragranular layer (2/3), lower but clear distribution in layers 1 and 6, and very few puncta in layers 5 and 4B. However, there were also important differences between macaques and humans. In layer 4A of human, there was a sparse distribution of VGluT2-ir puncta, whereas in macaque, there was a dense distribution with the characteristic honeycomb organization. The results suggest important changes in the pattern of cortical VGluT2 immunostaining that may be related to evolutionary differences in the cortical organization of LGN afferents between Old World monkeys and humans.

To determine whether its anatomical abnormalities may be associated with cognitive deficits in the onset of schizophrenia, we assessed thalamic Volume, shape, white matter integrity, and their correlations with cognition in patients with first-episode schizophrenia. T1-weighted magnetic resonance and diffusion tensor (DT) images were collected in 49 healthy comparison controls (CON) and 32 patients with FES (FES). Large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM) algorithms were used to delineate and assess the thalamic shape from MRI scans. The thalamic white matter integrity was quantified by fractional anisotropy (FA) and mean diffusivity (MD) averaged over the thalamus using DTI. Our analysis revealed that FES did not differ from CON in FA and MID but did differ markedly from them in the thalamic volume and shape. Patients with FES also performed poorly in spatial working memory and executive tasks. The correlation study found that regional thalamic shapes highly correlate with the two cognitive scores in the entire sample and healthy comparison controls but not in patients with FES even though no correlation was found between the thalamic volumes with the two cognitive scores in any group. Left thalamic FA was correlated with spatial working memory deficits in FES. Our findings suggest that thalamic Volume and shape abnormalities are evident at the onset of FES prior to thalamic abnormal white matter integrity. Altered microstructural white matter integrity assessed using DTI may not be apparent in FES but may be observed as the disease progresses. Cognitive deficits related to spatial working memory and executive functioning in FES were observed in the context of loss of their normal relationship with the thalamic shapes, that is, regionally-specific thalamic shape compression is associated with poor performance in executive functioning and spatial working memory.

The trichromatic system of Old-World monkeys and humans has relatively few S-cones in the fovea. In this study, we investigated the distribution of putative S-cone afferents in macaques primary visual cortex (V1) which form a characteristic honeycomb arrangement in layer 4A. It was hypothesized that if there were a low number of S-cone opponent projecting neurons in central vision then this would be seen as a reduction in afferents in foveal layer 4A. Recent studies have shown that the vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGlut2) is a marker for thalamic afferent terminals in cortex. The distribution of VGlut2-immunoreactive (-ir) terminals was studied in the foveal and perifoveal representation of V1. It was found that there was a substantial reduction in the terminal density in the foveal representation: the density was 5-6 times lower in the foveal V1 than in regions representing perifoveal eccentricities of 1A degrees-2A degrees and beyond. These findings may provide the cortical substrate of foveal tritanopia, the reduced blue perceptual ability for small fields in the center of gaze.",Thalamic afferents; Visual cortex; S-cones; Vesicular glutamate transporter; Macaque; COLOR-OPPONENT PATHWAYS; STRIATE CORTEX; COMPARTMENTAL ORGANIZATION; MONKEY; RETINA; VGLUT2; REPRESENTATION; NEURONS; FIELD; COLOCALIZATION

Recent imaging studies of the thalamus suggest reductions in volume of the whole thalamus and reduced activity in the medial group of thalamic nuclei, which may indicate loss of functional input to the cortex. Using stereological techniques in six pairs of individually matched brains from schizophrenics and controls, we measured the volumes and obtained estimates of the number of neurons in the three subnuclei (parvocellular, pc; densocellular, dc; magnocellular, mc) of the mediodorsal nucleus (MD) and from the ventral posterior medial nucleus. There was a significant reduction in total neuron number in MD as a whole but this neuron loss was largely restricted to MDpc and MDdc [-30.9 and -24.5%, respectively (P less than or equal to 0.01)]. MDmc and the control ventral posterior medial nucleus showed no significant changes in cell number. Because the subnuclei of MD have different connections and project to different areas of the frontal cortex, the specific loss of neurons in MDpc and MDdc has implications for the functional defects observed in schizophrenia.",nan; NERVE-CELL LOSS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MEDIODORSAL NUCLEUS; GENE-EXPRESSION; HUNTINGTONS-DISEASE; RHESUS-MONKEY; BRAIN; PROJECTIONS; NEUROPATHOLOGY; MORPHOLOGY

In addition, stimuli inducing arousal also trigger a widespread electroencephalographic (EEG) response reflecting the coordinated activation of a large cortical network. Because functional connectivity between distant cortical areas is thought to be underpinned by trans-thalamic connections involving associative thalamic nuclei, we investigated the possible involvement of one principal associative thalamic nucleus, the medial pulvinar (PuM), in the sleeper's responsiveness to nociceptive stimuli. Intra-cortical and intra-thalamic signals were analysed in 440 intracranial electroencephalographic (iEEG) segments during nocturnal sleep in eight epileptic patients receiving laser nociceptive stimuli. The spectral coherence between the PuM and 10 cortical regions grouped in networks was computed during 5 s before and 1 s after the nociceptive stimulus and contrasted according to the presence or absence of an arousal EEG response. Pre- and post-stimulus phase coherence between the PuM and all cortical networks was significantly increased in instances of arousal, both during N2 and paradoxical (rapid eye movement [REM]) sleep. Thalamo-cortical enhancement in coherence involved both sensory and higher level cortical networks and predominated in the pre-stimulus period. The association between pre-stimulus widespread increase in thalamo-cortical coherence and subsequent arousal suggests that the probability of sleep interruption by a noxious stimulus increases when it occurs during phases of enhanced trans-thalamic transfer of information between cortical areas.",arousal; human; intracerebral EEG; nociceptive stimulus; sleep; thalamus; POSTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; PARIETAL CORTEX; CORTICOTHALAMIC CONNECTIONS; ANATOMICAL EVIDENCE; INFERIOR PARIETAL; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; PAIN PERCEPTION; HUMAN THALAMUS; RHESUS-MONKEY

A previous study at the electron microscopic level in cat anterior TRN has suggested that synchronous bursting activity could result from the large number of presumably GABAergic dendrodendritic synaptic contacts. However, little is known about the synaptology of the monkey thalamic reticular nucleus and whether it contains dendrodendritic contacts. To address this issue, we examined tissue obtained from Macaca fascicularis that was prepared for electron microscopy using postembedding techniques to demonstrate GABA immunoreactivity. Examination of the anterior (motor) and posterior (somatosensory) portions of the TRN disclosed the following: The majority of synaptic contacts (87.5% of 958) were formed by axon terminals showing no GABA immunoreactivity and making asymmetric synaptic contacts on dendrites or cell bodies. A further 6.4% of synaptic contacts was composed of GABA-immunoreactive presynaptic terminals making symmetric contacts with the dendrites of TRN neurons. The majority resembled the pleomorphic vesicle containing F-terminals seen in the dorsal thalamus and known to originate from axons of TRN. A subset or possible second class did not resemble any previously described class of GABA-immunoreactive terminals in the TRN. Both classes of these terminals making symmetric contacts may originate wholly or partially within the nucleus. There was one dendrodendritic synaptic contact and only a small number (3.2%) of axodendritic contacts with synaptic vesicles visible both pre- and postsynaptically. We conclude that dendrodendritic contacts are probably not responsible for the synchronized bursting neuronal activity seen in the slow-wave sleep of monkeys, and that, if TRN neurons are coupled synaptically, the most likely mechanism is through the synapses formed by recurrent axon collaterals of TRN neurons onto TRN dendrites.

The purpose of this study was to determine whether the DMFC has a topographic map coding final eye position, and to ascertain whether this region subserves the maintenance of eye position. The DMFC was stimulated electrically while monkeys fixated a target presented somewhere in visual space. A series of parametric tests was conducted to ascertain the best stimulation parameters to evoke saccades. Electrical stimulation typically produced contraversive saccades that converged onto a region of space, the termination zone. For some stimulation sites, however, stimulation produced ipsiversive saccades. This occurred when the termination zone was located straight ahead of the monkey. Convergence onto an orbital position was never observed during stimulation of the frontal eye fields (FEF), stimulation of which evoked fixed-vector saccades. The latency to evoke a saccade from the DMFC varied with fixation position, such that it increased monotonically the closer the fix spot was to the termination zone. Moreover, the probability of evoking a saccade from the DMFC decreased the closer the fix spot was to the termination zone. The latency for evoking a saccade and the probability of evoking a saccade from the FEF did not vary with fixation position. Horizontal head movements were not evoked from the DMFC while a monkey fixated targets presented in different positions of visual space. Moveover, changing the position of the head with respect to the body did not change the location of a termination zone with respect to the head. The DMFC was found to contain a topographic coding of termination zones, with rostral sites representing zones in extreme contralateral visual space, and caudal sites representing zones straight ahead or ipsilaterally. Furthermore, lateral sites represented zones in upper visual space, whereas medial sites represented zones in lower visual space. Once the eyes were positioned within a termination zone, further stimulation fixed the gaze and inhibited visually evoked saccades. Following release from inhibition, which occurred shortly after the end of stimulation, the saccades reached the visual target accurately. This shows that the stimulation delayed the execution of the saccades without actually aborting their execution. We conclude that the DMFC contains a map representing eye position in craniotopic coordinates, and we argue that this map is utilized to maintain eye position.",DORSOMEDIAL FRONTAL CORTEX; SACCADES; TOPOGRAPHY; ELECTRICAL STIMULATION; RHESUS MONKEY; SUPPLEMENTARY EYE FIELD; INTRACORTICAL MICROSTIMULATION; MOTOR AREA; VISUOMOTOR FUNCTIONS; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; OCULOMOTOR SYSTEM; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; CENTRAL THALAMUS; GUIDED SACCADES; MOVEMENTS

In each experiment, single or multiple injections of various retrograde fluorescent tracers were injected into adjacent regions or areas. In two experiments, horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was injected into the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and the lateral pulvinar, respectively. The results show that the thalamo-cortical projection from LGN to striate cortex and from pulvinar to the prestriate cortex are similarly organized, but the geniculo-striate projection is more precise than the pulvinar-prestriate projection. The pulvinar-prestriate projection is topographically organized and preserves topological neighbourhood relations. Projection zones to the various visual areas are concentrically wrapped around each other. The projection zone to area 18 constitutes a central core region. It begins ventro-laterally in PuL where the pulvinar is in contact with the LGN. This contact zone we called the hilus region of the pulvinar. The area 18-projection zone stretches as a central cone into the posterior pulvinar through PuL and into PuM. It is surrounded by the projection zone to the posterior belt of area 19 and this in turn is surrounded by the projection zone to the anterior belt of area 19. The projection zones to area 19 are then surrounded medially and dorsally by zones projectiong to the temporal and parietal association cortex, respectively. The projection zone to area MT is located medio-ventrally in the posterior pulvinar (PuIP and surrounding nuclei) and coincides with a densely myelinated region. Area 17 also receives input from the pulvinar but probably predominantly in the region of the central visual field. The pulvinar zone projecting to area 17 is located ventrolaterally from the central core region projecting to area 18 and is contiguous laterally with the LGN. If the positions of the vertical and the horizontal meridian in the pulvinar correspond to those in the respective cortical projection zones, a second order visual field representation such as found in area 18, with the horizontal meridian split at an excentricity of about 7-10-degrees, can also be recognized in the pulvinar.",PULVINAR; AREA-17; PRESTRIATE CORTEX; THALAMOCORTICAL ORGANIZATION; CALLITHRIX JACCHUS; MONKEY AOTUS-TRIVIRGATUS; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE HRP; POSTERIOR-PULVINAR COMPLEX; ADJACENT LATERAL PULVINAR; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; INFERIOR PULVINAR; MACAQUE MONKEY; RHESUS-MONKEY; OWL MONKEY

Although the two receptor subtypes show a markedly different distribution in the rat brain, their distribution in the primate brain has not been described previously. In this study, the neuroanatomic distribution of CRF1 and CRF2 receptor binding sites in rhesus monkey (Macaca mulatta) was assessed by using iodine 125 ([I-125)-Tyr(0)] -sauvagine with or without the selective CRF1 receptor antagonist CP-154,526-1. Radiolabeled human cRNA probes were used to map the distribution of the two receptor mRNAs with in situ hybridization. Both CRF1 and CRF2 receptors were found in the pituitary and throughout the neocortex (especially, in prefrontal, cingulate, striate, and insular cortices), amygdala, and hippocampal formation of the monkey brain. This is in contrast to the distribution of these receptors reported in the rat brain, in which generally only the CRF1 receptor is found in the pituitary and neocortex. These results suggest that, in primates, both CRF1 and CRF2 receptors may be involved in mediating the effects of CRF on cognition, behavior, and pituitary-adrenal function. The presence of CRF1 (but not CRF2) receptors within the locus coeruleus, cerebellar cortex, nucleus of the solitary tract, thalamus, and striatum and of CRF2 (but not CRF1) receptors in the choroid plexus, certain hypothalamic nuclei, the nucleus prepositus, and the nucleus of the stria terminalis suggests that each receptor subtype also may have distinct functional roles within the primate central nervous system.

Sensory information is believed to then propagate through the cortical column along the L4 -> L2/3 -> L5/6 pathway. Here, we show that sensory-evoked responses of L5/6 neurons in rats derive instead from direct TC synapses. Many L5/6 neurons exhibited sensory-evoked postsynaptic potentials with the same latencies as L4. Paired in vivo recordings from L5/6 neurons and thalamic neurons revealed substantial convergence of direct TC synapses onto diverse types of infragranular neurons, particularly in L5B. Pharmacological inactivation of L4 had no effect on sensory-evoked synaptic input to L5/6 neurons. L4 is thus not an obligatory distribution hub for cortical activity, and thalamus activates two separate, independent strata of cortex in parallel.",nan; PRIMARY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; BARREL CORTEX; STRIATE CORTEX; PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; RAT NEOCORTEX; MOUSE; CAT; PROJECTIONS; MACAQUE

The purpose of this pilot study was to evaluate the feasibility of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) based probabilistic tractography of deep brain structures that are commonly used for pre- and perioperative targeting for functional neurosurgery. Three targets were reconstructed based on their significance as intervention sites or as a no-go area to avoid adverse side effects: the connections propagating from the thalamus to (1) primary and supplementary motor areas, (2) to somatosensory areas and the cerebello-thalamic tract (CTT). We evaluated the overlap of the reconstructed connectivity based targets with corresponding atlas based data, and tested the inter-subject and inter-scanner variability by acquiring repeated DTI from four volunteers, and on three MRI scanners with similar sequence parameters. Compared to a 3D histological atlas of the human thalamus, moderate overlaps of 35-50% were measured between connectivity-and atlas based volumes, while the minimal distance between the centerpoints of atlas and connectivity targets was 2.5 mm. The variability caused by the MRI scanner was similar to the inter-subject variability, except for connections with the postcentral gyrus where it was higher. While CTT resolved the anatomically correct trajectory of the tract individually, high volumetric variability was found across subjects and between scanners. DTI can be applied in the clinical, preoperative setting to reconstruct the CTT and to localize subdivisions within the lateral thalamus. In our pilot study, such subdivisions moderately matched the borders of the ventrolateral-posteroventral (VLpv) nucleus and the ventral-posterolateral (VPL) nucleus. Limitations of the currently used standard DTI protocols were exacerbated by large scanner-to-scanner variability of the connectivity-based targets.",diffusion MRI; diffusion tensor imaging; brain connectivity; cerebello-thalamic tract; functional neurosurgery; DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; OF-THE-LITERATURE; PROBABILISTIC TRACTOGRAPHY; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; MOVEMENT-DISORDERS; CORTICOTHALAMIC CONNECTIONS; VENTRALIS INTERMEDIUS; STEREOTACTIC ATLAS; RHESUS-MONKEY

The thalamus also receives inputs from basal ganglia nuclei (BG) involved in value-based decision making, suggesting a role in the value process. We found that neurons in a particular area of the rhesus macaque posterior thalamus encoded the historical value memory of visual objects. Many of these value-coding neurons were located in the suprageniculate nucleus (SGN). This thalamic area directly received anatomical input from the superior colliculus (SC), and the neurons showed visual responses with contralateral preferences. Notably, the value discrimination activity of these thalamic neurons increased during learning, with the learned values stably retained even more than 200 days after learning. Our data indicate that single neurons in the posterior thalamus not only processed simple visual information but also represented historical values. Furthermore, our data suggest an SC-posterior thalamus-BG-SC subcortical loop circuit that encodes the historical value, enabling a quick automatic gaze by bypassing the visual cortex.",nan; BASAL GANGLIA CIRCUITS; SUPRAGENICULATE NUCLEUS; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; VISUAL PROPERTIES; ORGANIZATION; NEURONS; CONNECTIONS; PROJECTIONS; PATHWAY

Reduction of thalamic neurons, a key feature of the neuropathology of schizophrenia, could also have a prenatal origin via disruption of thalamic neurogenesis. This study investigates whether craniofacial dysmorphology and thalamic neuron loss might be associated manifestations of a disruption in embryonic development. Methods: Thalamic neurons were deleted by exposing fetal macaques to x-rays during thalamic genesis (E3342). Another group of macaques was irradiated after thalamic genesis (E70-81). Body, head, and facial measurements were obtained from the early irradiated (EX), late irradiated (LX), and control animals at adulthood. Results: Head width, distance between outer eye edges, and ear width were smaller in EX macaques compared with control animals. The LX macaques exhibited only reduced ear width compared with control animals. Conclusions: These findings indicate that certain features of thalamic neuropathology and craniofacial dysmorphogenesis observed in schizophrenic patients may have a common etiology.

The first network consists of ten feedforward levels where a Poisson spike train with varying firing rate is applied as an input in layer one. Although the balanced state partially avoids spike synchronization during the transmission, the average firing-rate in the last layer either decays or saturates depending on the feedforward pathway gain. The last layer activity is almost independent of the input even for a carefully chosen intermediate gain. Adding connections to the feedforward pathway by a nine areas Pulvinar structure improves the firing-rate propagation to become almost linear among layers. Incoming strong pulvinar spikes balance the low feedforward gain to have a unit input-output relation in the last layer. Pulvinar neurons evoke a bimodal activity depending on the magnitude input: synchronized spike bursts between 20 and 80 Hz and an asynchronous activity for very both low and high frequency inputs. In the first regime, spikes of last feedforward layer neurons are asynchronous with weak, low frequency, oscillations in the rate. Here, the uncorrelated incoming feedforward pathway washes out the synchronized thalamic bursts. In the second regime, spikes in the whole network are asynchronous. As the number of cortical layers increases, long-range pulvinar connections can link directly two or more cortical stages avoiding their either saturation or gradual activity falling. The Pulvinar acts as a shortcut that supplies the input-output firing-rate relationship of two separated cortical areas without changing the strength of connections in the feedforward pathway.",feedforward network; cortical transmission; pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus; cortico-thalamo-cortical connections; asynchronous spike transmission; balanced network; SYNCHRONOUS SPIKING; STABLE PROPAGATION; SIGNAL PROPAGATION; NEURONAL NETWORKS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; MACAQUE MONKEY; VISUAL-SYSTEM; FIRING RATES; MODEL; RELAY

Emphasis was on connections with the pulvinar. Patterns of corticopulvinar connections were related to subdivisions of the inferior pulvinar (PI) defined by histochemical or immunocytochemical architecture. Connections of DL/MTC were with the PI subdivisions, PICM, PICL, and PIP; the lateral pulvinar (PL); and, more sparsely, the lateral portion of the medial pulvinar (PM). In squirrel monkeys, there was a tendency for caudal DL to have stronger connections with PICL than PICM and for rostral DL/MTC to have stronger connections with PICM than PICL. In all three primates, DL/MTC had reciprocal connections with the pulvinar and claustrum; received afferents from the locus coeruleus, dorsal raphe, nucleus annularis, central superior nucleus, pontine reticular formation, lateral geniculate nucleus, paracentral nucleus, central medial nucleus, lateral hypothalamus, basal nucleus of the amygdala, and basal nucleus of Meynert/substantia innominata; and sent efferents to the pons, superior colliculus, reticular nucleus, caudate, and putamen. Projections from DL/MTC to the nucleus of the optic tract were also observed in squirrel and owl monkeys. Similarities in the subcortical connections of the dorsolateral region, especially those with the pulvinar, provide further support for the conclusion that the DL regions are homologous in the three primate groups.

To test those hypotheses, we sampled single-unit activity from connected basal ganglia output and thalamic nuclei (globus pallidus-internus [GPi] and ventrolateral anterior nucleus [VLa]) in monkeys performing a reaching task. Rate increases were the most common peri-movement change in both nuclei. Moreover, peri-movement changes generally began earlier in VLa than in GPi. Simultaneously recorded GPi-VLa pairs rarely showed short-time-scale spike-to-spike correlations or slow across-trials covariations, and both were equally positive and negative. Finally, spontaneous GPi bursts and pauses were both followed by small, slow reductions in VLa rate. These results appear incompatible with standard gating and rebound models. Still, gating or rebound may be possible in other physiological situations: simulations show how GPi-VLa communication can scale with GPi synchrony and GPi-to-VLa convergence, illuminating how synchrony of basal ganglia output during motor learning or in pathological conditions may render this pathway effective. Thus, in the healthy state, basal ganglia-thalamic communication during learned movement is more subtle than expected, with changes in firing rates possibly being dominated by a common external source.",nan; DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; HIGH-FREQUENCY STIMULATION; PRIMATE GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; MOTOR THALAMUS; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; CORTICOTHALAMIC TERMINALS; RECIPIENT THALAMUS; CORTICAL AREAS; ARM MOVEMENTS; BASIC PROCESS

The selection of an appropriate target is first evident even before thalamic axons grow into the cortical plate: initially axons accumulate and wait below their cortical target area in a zone called the subplate. This zone also contains the first postmitotic neurons of the cerebral cortex, the subplate neurons. Here we have investigated whether subplate neurons are involved in the process of target selection by thalamic axons by ablating them from specific cortical regions at the onset of the waiting period and examining the subsequent thalamocortical axon projection patterns. Subplate neurons were ablated at the onset of the waiting period by intracortical injections of kainic acid. The effect of the ablation on the thalamocortical projection from visual thalamus was examined by DiI-labeling of the LGN days to weeks following the lesion. At two to four weeks post-lesion, times when LGN axons would have normally invaded the cortical plate, the axons remained below the cortical plate and grew past their appropriate cortical target in an anomalous pathway. Moreover, examination of LGN axons at one week post-lesion, a time when they would normally be waiting and branching within the visual subplate, indicated that the axons had already grown past their correct destination. These observations suggest that visual subplate neurons are involved in the process by which LGN axons select and subsequently grow into visual cortex. In contrast, subplate neurons do not appear to play a major role in the initial morphological development of the LGN itself. Subplate ablations did not alter dendritic growth or shapes of LGN projection neurons during the period under study, nor did it prevent the segregation of retinal ganglion cell axons into eye-specific layers. However, the overall size of the LGN was reduced, suggesting that there may be increased cell death of LGN neurons in the absence of subplate neurons. To examine whether subplate neurons beneath other neocortical areas play a similar role in the formation of thalamocortical connections, subplate neurons were deleted beneath auditory cortex at the onset of the waiting period for auditory thalamic axons. Subsequent DiI labeling revealed that in these animals the majority of MGN axons had grown past auditory cortex instead of innervating it. Taken together these observations underscore a general requirement for subplate neurons throughout neocortex in the process of cortical target selection and ingrowth by thalamic axons. Moreover, they imply that the cortical plate alone has insufficient information to direct the formation of specific sets of thalamocortical connections: interactions involving subplate neurons must also be present.",SUBPLATE NEURONS; CEREBRAL CORTEX; TARGET SELECTION; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; CAT CEREBRAL-CORTEX; WHITE MATTER; POSTNATAL-DEVELOPMENT; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; PRENATAL DEVELOPMENT; NEURITE OUTGROWTH; CORTICAL AREAS; RHESUS-MONKEY; CELLS

The results show that the medial extrastriate region above the calcarine sulcus projects mainly to the lateral pulvinar (PL), medial pulvinar (PM), and lateral posterior (LP) nuclei. In addition, the dorsal portion of the medial region has connections to the lateral dorsal (LD) as well as to intralaminar nuclei. The dorsolateral extrastriate region projects strongly to the PL and LP nuclei, to the PM and inferior pulvinar (PI) nuclei, and to the LD and intralaminar nuclei. The lateral extrastriate region above the inferior occipital sulcus (IOS) has strong connections to both the PL and PI nuclei and has minor projections to the PM and oral pulvinar nuclei. The ventrolateral extrastriate region below the IOS projects mainly to the PI nucleus and to the caudal portion of the PL nucleus and has some projections to the PM nucleus. The ventromedial extrastriate region medial to the occipitotemporal sulcus has strong connections with the ventral and medial sectors of the PI nucleus. This region also projects to the caudal portion of the PL nucleus and has minor connections to the LP nucleus. Finally, the annectant gyrus projects to the PL nucleus and to the rostral portion of the PI nucleus and has minor connections to the PM nucleus. Thus, the medial and dorsolateral extrastriate regions are related mainly to the PL and LP nuclei as well as to intralaminar nuclei. In contrast, the ventrolateral and ventromedial regions are connected strongly with the PI nucleus. This connectional organization appears to reflect functional differentiation at the cortical level.

This system is analysed by resorting to informational neuromorphology which deduces particular properties of information processing from spatial features observed on neuronal arborisations or sets of arborisations. The main part of the cerebro-cerebellar circuit is fine grained with relatively small arborisations. Such a fine grain is not used here for the preservation of a simple somatotopic representation, as is the case for sensory systems, but instead for a processing using << patchy maps >> which is a known mode of parallel processing. There is a major break of arborisations geometry which is situated in the cerebellar cortex between the granule and Purkinje cells. The grain cells axons, the parallel fibers, are numerous and almost unbranched while the dendritic arborisations of Purkinje's cells are flat, with a large surface and are perpendicular to the parallel fibers which leads to both a cardinal and a reception convergence. This is also observed in the striato-pallidal system. A significant difference between the two systems which are separated almost everywhere, notably at the thalamic relays level, is that the system passing through the cerebellum essentially processes sensorimotor information while the basal ganglia system receives information from almost the whole cortex. The return to the cortical targets causes complex interferences. It clearly appears that the two motor systems process information in different manners.",nan; PRECENTRAL MOTOR CORTEX; FRONTAL EYE FIELD; RHESUS-MONKEY; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; MACAQUE MONKEY; GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; MACACA-FASCICULARIS; SAIMIRI-SCIUREUS; SQUIRREL-MONKEYS; ARCUATE PREMOTOR

Objective: To assess the beneficial effects of ANT stimulation on hippocampal neurons of epileptic monkeys. Methods: Chronic ANT stimulation was applied to kainic acid-induced epileptic monkeys. Behavioral seizures were continuously monitored. Immunohistochemical staining and western blot assays were performed to assess the hippocampal injury and the effects of ANT stimulation. Results: The frequency of seizures was 42.8% lower in the stimulation group compared with the sham-stimulation group. Immunohistochemical staining and western blot analyses indicated that neuronal loss and apoptosis were less severe and that neurofilament synthesis was enhanced in the stimulation monkeys compared with the sham-stimulation group. These data showed that the hippocampal injury was less severe in monkeys in the stimulation group than in those in the sham-stimulation group. Conclusions: Our data suggest that chronic ANT stimulation may exert protective effects on hippocampal neurons and boost the regeneration of neuronal fibers. These effects may be closely related to the mechanisms of ANT stimulation in epilepsy treatment. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Although QSM has many applications in detecting iron deposits in the human brain, including the distribution of iron deposits in specific brain regions, the change of iron deposition with aging, and the comparison of iron deposits between diseased groups and healthy controls, few studies have applied QSM to non-human primates, while most animal brain experiments focus on biochemical and anatomical results instead of non-invasive experiments. Additionally, brain imaging in children's research is difficult, but can be substituted using young rhesus monkeys, which are very similar to humans, as research animals. Therefore, understanding the relationship between iron deposition and age in rhesus macaques' brains can offer insights into both the developmental trajectory of magnetic susceptibility in the animal model and the correlated evidence in children's research. Twenty-three healthy rhesus macaque monkeys (23 +/- 7.85 years, range 2-29 years) were included in this research. Seven regions of interest (ROIs-globus pallidus, substantia nigra, dentate nucleus, caudate nucleus, putamen, thalamus, red nucleus) have been analyzed in terms of QSM and R-2* (apparent relaxation rate). Susceptibility in most ROIs correlated significantly with the growth of age, similarly to the results for R-2*, but showed different trends in the thalamus and red nucleus, which may be caused by the different sensitivities of myelination and iron deposition in R-2* and QSM analysis. By assessing the correlation between iron content and age in healthy rhesus macaques' brains using QSM, we provide a piece of pilot information on normality for advanced animal disease models. Meanwhile, this study also could serve as the normative basis for further clinical studies using QSM for iron content quantification. Due to the comparison of the susceptibility on the same experimental objects, this research can also provide practical support for future research on characteristics for QSM and R-2*.",brain; iron content; QSM; rhesus macaque; NONHUMAN PRIMATE MODELS; DEEP GRAY-MATTER; IRON DEPOSITION; BASAL GANGLIA; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; MAPPING QSM; AGE; MRI; R-2-ASTERISK; GENDER

Throughout this so-called slow oscillation, cortical and thalamic neurons fluctuate between periods of intense synaptic activity (Up states) and almost complete silence (Down states). The two decades since the original characterization of the slow oscillation in the cortex and thalamus have seen considerable advances in deciphering the cellular and network mechanisms associated with this pervasive phenomenon. There are, nevertheless, many questions regarding the slow oscillation that await more thorough illumination, particularly the mechanisms by which Up states initiate and terminate, the functional role of the rhythmic activity cycles in unconscious or minimally conscious states, and the precise relation between Up states and the activated states associated with waking behavior. Given the substantial advances in multineuronal recording and imaging methods in both in vivo and in vitro preparations, the time is ripe to take stock of our current understanding of the slow oscillation and pave the way for future investigations of its mechanisms and functions.

The preferred stimulus orientation of these columns span the full range of orientations, as observed in recordings of spikes and in classical optical imaging of intrinsic signals. However, when we imaged the putative thalamic input to striate cortical cells that can be seen in imaging of intrinsic signals when they are analyzed on a larger spatial scale, we found that the orientation domain map of the primary visual cortex did not show the same diversity of orientations. This map was dominated by just the one orientation that is most commonly preferred by neurons in the retina and the lateral geniculate nucleus. This supports cortical feature selectivity and columnar architecture being built upon feed-forward signals transmitted from the thalamus in a very limited number of broadly tuned input channels.",visual cortex; thalamocortical inputs; orientation selectivity; optical imaging of intrinsic signals; radial bias; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; OCULAR-DOMINANCE COLUMNS; RECEPTIVE-FIELD PROPERTIES; FOVEAL STRIATE CORTEX; ORIENTATION SELECTIVITY; FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE; RESPONSE PROPERTIES; GANGLION-CELLS; NEURAL BASIS; PREFERRED ORIENTATION

Despite well described connections on a microscopic scale, derived from tracing studies in animals, little is known about the intrinsic anatomical connections of these nuclei in humans. This lack of knowledge limits not only interpretation of functional imaging studies but also estimation of direct effects of deep brain stimulation which treats diseases as different as epilepsy or major depression. Therefore, non-invasive diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies are key to analyzing connectivity patterns and elaborate approaches to close this gap. For our study, we explored the structural connectivity of the MD thalamic nuclei and the CM/Pf complex towards five cortical and six subcortical regions by using a preferential fiber calculation. We found both thalamic nuclei to be preferentially associated to distinct networks: whereas the MD is preferentially connected to prefrontal and limbic cortical regions, the CM is linked to subcortical regions. The anterior insula was the only cortical region associated with the subcortical network of the CM and the cortical network of the MD comprised one subcortical hub, the caudate nucleus, suggesting an integrative role of these two regions. Adding to predescribed anatomical tract tracing connectivities in animal studies, our finding lends support to the existence of similar basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits in humans and we could show a robust distinction of preferential connectivity for both thalamic nuclei.

Three patients had a lateral TL seizure origin, and 3 patients had mesial TL tumors. Bilateral TLE was assumed in 7 patients. Only in the patient group with MTLE (n = 11), the ipsilateral thalamic glucose uptake showed a statistically significant lower value when compared to the thalamus of the contralateral side (Wilcoxon paired sign test, P = 0.012). There was a more pronounced hypometabolism in right TLE compared to left TLE. A 'hypersynchronous seizure onset pattern' in ictal EEG was only seen in 6 (26%) patients (1 patient with bilateral, 5 with unilateral TLE).

To determine which GABAA receptor subunit proteins are found in the human thalamus we investigated the distribution of five major GABAA receptor subunits alpha(1), alpha(2), alpha(3), beta(2,3) and gamma(2) using immunohistochemical techniques. The alpha(1), beta(2,3)- and gamma(2)- subunits which combine to form a benzodiazepine sensitive GABAA receptor showed the most intense levels of staining and were the most common subunits found throughout the human thalamus especially in the ventral and posterior nuclear groups. The next most intense staining was for the alpha(3)-subunit followed by the alpha(2)-subunit. The intralaminar nuclear group, the mediodorsal nucleus and the thalamic reticular nucleus contained alpha(1)-, beta(2,3)-and gamma(2)-subunits staining as well as the highest levels of the alpha(2)- and alpha(3)- subunits. The sensory dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus contained very high levels of alpha(1)- and beta(2,3)- and gamma(2) -subunits. The highest densities of GABAA receptors found throughout the thalamus which contained the subunits alpha(1), beta(2,3), and gamma(2) included nuclei which are especially involved in the control or the modulation of the cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical motor circuits and are thus important in disorders such as Huntington's disease where the GABAergic projections of the basal ganglia are compromised. In addition the majority of receptors in the thalamic reticular nucleus contain alpha(3) and gamma(2) subunits whilst the intralaminar nuclei contain high levels of alpha(2) and alpha(3) subunits.

In unoperated animals, the region of VPL representing the hand was characterized by relatively dense and homogeneous CO staining throughout the rostral-caudal extent of VPL. Counts of neurons in the VPL hand representation from adjacent thalamic sections processed for Nissl and GABA immunostaining indicated that there were approximately 261.4 neurons/mm(2) of which 78.4/mm(2) stained positive for GABA. GABA(+) puncta-like terminals were readily apparent throughout the VPL. By contrast, animals that received total removals of the postcentral hand representations showed a dramatic reduction in CO staining in the VPL, which was confined to the expected location of the thalamic hand representation. Counts of neurons in the affected region from adjacent sections that underwent Nissl staining and GABA immunostaining also revealed a dramatic reduction of Nissl-stained neurons, with a smaller reduction in the number of neurons staining positive for GABA. Specifically, large to medium-sized (> 180 mu m(2)) GABA(-) neurons were virtually eliminated in the affected portion of the VPL, and the numbers of GABA(+) neurons were significantly reduced. The remaining population of GABA(+) neurons was typically shrunken, and no GABA(+) puncta-like terminals were observed in the affected region. The results obtained after subtotal ablation of the postcentral hand representations (only one postcentral area spared, 3b or 3a) differed from those obtained when total removals were made. Instead of virtually complete degeneration of medium-sized to large neurons throughout the hand representation in VPL, as was the case with total removals, after partial removals, we found alternating regions in the VPL hand representation that appeared qualitatively normal, or dramatically degenerated. Thalamic sections stained with CO revealed light, moderate, and darkly stained patches of label within the hand representation in VP, depending on the type of cortical ablation. The most dramatic reduction of Nissl-stained neurons coincided precisely with the lightest staining CO patches. Interestingly, the only statistically significant reduction in the number of GABA(+) neurons occurred in the light CO patches. In the thalamic regions coincident with the dark and moderately stained CO patches, the number of medium-sized and large neurons decreased, but the number of GABA(+) neurons was comparable to normal. Optical density measurements of the dark patches also indicated a statistically significant difference from normal CO staining in this region. These findings indicate that following cortical damage, complex changes occur in thalamic circuitry. Interestingly, these changes are not confined to regions of the thalamus that have their major projection to the damaged region of cortex, but include thalamic regions in which the major projection is to undamaged regions of cortex. Thus, relatively restricted cortical damage has the potential to affect regions of cortex not directly damaged, through post-injury changes in thalamic circuitry. Such changes in neuronal circuitry, especially at the thalamocortical level, may serve as the neural substrate for the limited recovery of behavioral function often seen after strokes or head injury.

However, despite extensive research, uncertainty about the ideal target remains with many structures being underexplored. The aim of this report is to address a new target for DBS, the medial dorsal (MD) and the ventral anterior (VA) nucleus of the thalamus, which has thus far received little attention in the treatment of OCD. Methods In this retrospective trial, four patients (three female, one male) aged 31-48 years, suffering from therapy-refractory OCD underwent high-frequency DBS of the MD and VA. In two patients (de novo group) the thalamus was chosen as a primary target for DBS, whereas in two patients (rescue DBS group) lead implantation was performed in a rescue DBS attempt following unsuccessful primary stimulation. Results Continuous thalamic stimulation yielded no significant improvement in OCD symptom severity. Over the course of thalamic DBS symptoms improved in only one patient who showed partial response on the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive (Y-BOCS) Scale. Beck Depression Inventory scores dropped by around 46% in the de novo group; anxiety symptoms improved by up to 34%. In the de novo DBS group no effect of DBS on anxiety and mood was observable. Conclusion MD/VA-DBS yielded no adequate alleviation of therapy-refractory OCD, the overall strategy in targeting MD/VA as described in this paper can thus not be recommended in DBS for OCD. The magnocellular portion of MD (MDMC), however, might prove a promising target in the treatment of mood related and anxiety disorders.",nan; OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE-DISORDER; TERM-FOLLOW-UP; STEREOTACTIC LIMBIC LEUKOTOMY; MEDIODORSAL NUCLEUS; BASAL GANGLIA; CAPSULAR STIMULATION; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; MAJOR DEPRESSION; RHESUS-MONKEY; FRONTAL-LOBE

Knowledge of these connections in the human is a prerequisite for stereotactic neurosurgical approaches designed to alleviate movement disorders by the placement of lesions in specific nuclei. Transfer to humans of connectional information derived from experimental studies in nonhuman primates requires agreement about the equivalence of nuclei in the different species, and dialogue between experimentalists and neurosurgeons would be facilitated by the use of a common nomenclature. In this review, the authors compare the different nomenclatures and review the cyto- and chemoarchitecture of the nuclei in the anterolateral aspect of the ventral nuclear mass in humans and monkeys, suggest which nuclei are equivalent, and propose a common terminology. On this basis, it is possible to identify the nuclei of the human motor thalamus that transfer information from the substantia nigra, globus pallidus, cerebellum, and proprioceptive components of the medial lemniscus to prefrontal, premotor, motor, and somatosensory areas of the cerebral cortex. It also becomes possible to suggest the principal functional systems involved in stereotactically guided thalamotomies and the functional basis of the symptoms observed following ischemic lesions in different parts of the human thalamus.",cerebellum; pallidum; substantia nigra; proprioception; thalamocortical projection; human; monkey; SINGLE-UNIT ANALYSIS; RHESUS-MONKEY; MACACA-MULATTA; BASAL GANGLIA; INTRACORTICAL MICROSTIMULATION; SOMATOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; CORTICAL PROJECTIONS; REVISED NOMENCLATURE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEYS

Despite early evidence and theoretical proposal pointing to an implication of thalamic control in attention, most studies in the past two decades focused on cortical substrates, largely ignoring the contribution of subcortical regions as well as cortico-subcortical interactions. Here, we suggest a key role of the pulvinar in the selection of salient and relevant information via its involvement in priority maps. Prioritization may be achieved through a pulvinar-mediated generation of alpha oscillations, which may then modulate neuronal gain in thalamo-cortical circuits. Such mechanism might orchestrate the synchrony of cortico-cortical interaction, by rendering neural communication more effective, precise and selective. We propose that this theoretical framework will support a timely shift from the prevailing cortico-centric view of cognition to a more integrative perspective of thalamic contributions to attention and executive control processes.",Selective attention; Thalamo-cortical circuit; Pulvinar; Priority maps; Alpha oscillations; Neural gain; VISUAL-SPATIAL ATTENTION; LATERAL INTRAPARIETAL AREA; SALIENCE-BASED PROGRESSION; HUMAN BRAIN; NEW-WORLD; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; PARIETAL CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; PRIORITY MAPS

Neurons in the ventral posterior lateral (VPL) nucleus of the somatosensory thalamus and in primary somatosensory cortex (S1) respond to vibrotactile stimulation with relatively slow modulations (similar to 100 ms) of their firing rate. In addition, faster modulations (similar to 10 ms) time-locked to the stimulus waveform are observed in both areas, but their contribution to stimulus detection is unknown. Furthermore, it is unclear whether VPL and S1 neurons encode stimulus presence with similar accuracy and via the same response features. To address these questions, we recorded single neurons while trained monkeys judged the presence or absence of a vibrotactile stimulus of variable amplitude, and their activity was analyzed with a unique decoding method that is sensitive to the time scale of the firing rate fluctuations. We found that the maximum detection accuracy of single neurons is similar in VPL and S1. However, VPL relies more heavily on fast rate modulations than S1, and as a consequence, the neural code in S1 is more tolerant: its performance degrades less when the readout method or the time scale of integration is suboptimal. Therefore, S1 neurons implement a more robust code, one less sensitive to the temporal integration window used to infer stimulus presence downstream. The differences between VPL and S1 responses signaling the appearance of a stimulus suggest a transformation of the neural code from thalamus to cortex.",fast and slow modulations; neurometric; psychometric; rhesus monkey; flutter; PERCEPTUAL DECISION; MECHANORECEPTIVE AFFERENTS; FLUTTER-VIBRATION; DISCRIMINATION; NEURONS; STIMULATION; PERIODICITY; FREQUENCY; RESPONSES; PATTERNS

Subsequent high-resolution magnetic resonance scanning, however, showed involvement of the rostral mesencephalon as well.

Nevertheless, the role of corticothalamic circuits in sensory processing remains a mystery. In the visual system, afferents from retina to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and from LGN to primary visual cortex (V1) are organized into functionally distinct parallel processing streams. Physiological evidence suggests corticogeniculate feedback may be organized into parallel streams; however, little is known about the diversity of corticogeniculate neurons, their local computations, or the structure-function relationship among corticogeniculate neurons. We used a virus-mediated approach to label and reconstruct the complete dendritic and local axonal arbors of identified corticogeniculate neurons in the macaque monkey. Our results reveal morphological substrates for parallel streams of corticogeniculate feedback based on distinct classes of neurons in V1 and V2. These results support the hypothesis that distinct populations of feedback neurons provide independent and unique information to the LGN.",nan; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; STRIATE CORTEX; CORTICOTHALAMIC NEURONS; SUBLAMINAR ORGANIZATION; PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; LOCAL CIRCUITRY; RABIES VIRUS; BRAIN-STEM; LAYER-VI

The rabbit limbic thalamus may play an important role in these functions, but has not been studied extensively in terms of its cytoarchitecture, the topographical organization of its cortical projections, and differential transmitter regulation of its subnuclei. Therefore, the architecture, projections to cingulate cortex, and radioligand binding were investigated in the anterior, ventral, lateral, and midline nuclei of rabbit thalamus. The anterior nuclei are highly differentiated because both the dorsal and ventral nuclei have parvicellular and magnocellular divisions. Fluorescent dyes were injected into cingulate cortex to evaluate limbic thalamocortical connections. The anterior medial, submedial, and parafascicular nuclei project primarily to anterior cingulate cortex, while they have small or no projections to posterior areas. The ventral anterior and ventral lateral nuclei have a significant projection to dorsal cingulate cortex, including areas 24b and 29d. Projections of the anterior ventral nucleus are topographically organized, since medial parts of the parvicellular division project to rostral area 29, and lateral parts project to caudal area 29. The lateral nuclei and the parvicellular and magnocellular divisions of the anterior dorsal nucleus project with progressively higher densities in the rostrocaudal plane of area 29. Finally, the magnocellular division of the anterior ventral nucleus projects almost exclusively to caudal and ventral area 29, i.e., granular retrosplenial cortex. Ligand binding studies employed coverslip autoradiography and single grain counting techniques. Muscarinic receptor binding was moderate for both pirenzepine and oxotremorine-M in the parvicellular anterior ventral nucleus, while in other nuclei, there was an inverse relationship in the binding for these ligands. Most notably, the anterior dorsal nucleus, which receives no cholinergic input, had very high oxotremorine-M and low pirenzepine binding, while the anterior medial nucleus, which receives a moderate cholinergic input, had the highest pirenzepine binding and very low oxotremorine-M binding. Muscimol binding to GABA(A) receptors was highest in the anterior ventral nucleus, while it was at moderate levels in the anterior dorsal and lateral nuclei. The binding of Tyr-D-Ala-Gly-MePhe-Gly-ol to mu opioid receptors and 2-D-penicillamine-5-D-penicillamine-enkephalin to delta opioid receptors were both high in the parvicellular and low in the magnocellular divisions of the anterior dorsal nucleus. The magnocellular division of the anterior ventral, the lateral dorsal, and the parafascicular nuclei had high mu opioid binding, while the lateral dorsal and lateral magnocellular nuclei had low levels of delta opioid binding. The submedial nucleus had moderate binding of both opioid compounds. These results suggest that the limbic thalamus in the rabbit is highly differentiated and has topographically organized connections to cingulate cortex. Some of these connections may mediate responses to noxious stimuli including those from the submedial and parafascicular nuclei. Finally, the ligand binding studies indicate that transmitter systems differentially regulate the various subnuclei within the limbic thalamus and may modulate different components of limbic thalamocortical circuitry.",LIMBIC SYSTEM; MUSCIMOL; CHOLINERGIC RECEPTORS; ENKEPHALIN RECEPTORS; THALAMIC NUCLEI; CENTRAL NERVOUS-SYSTEM; RETROGRADE AXONAL-TRANSPORT; NUCLEUS SUBMEDIUS; AUTORADIOGRAPHIC LOCALIZATION; RAT-BRAIN; INTRALAMINAR NUCLEI; RHESUS-MONKEY; SPINAL-CORD; EFFERENT CONNECTIONS; AFFERENT CONNECTIONS

However, it is unknown whether these increases occur in the thalamic division of the auditory system, the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN). Furthermore, it is also unclear whether these age-related changes are specific to the macaque auditory system or are generalized to other sensory systems. To address these questions, the PV immunoreactivity of the medial and lateral geniculate nuclei (LGN) from seven rhesus macaques ranging in age from 15 to 35 was assessed. Densities of PV expressing neurons in the three subdivisions of the MGN and the six layers of the LGN were calculated separately using unbiased stereological sampling techniques. We found that the ventral and magnocellular subdivisions of the MGN and all six layers of the LGN increased their expressions of PV with age, although increases in the MGN were greater in magnitude than in the LGN. Together, these results suggest that the MGN shows age-related increases in PV expression as is seen throughout the macaque ascending auditory system, and that the analogous region of the visual system shows smaller increases. We conclude that, while there are some similarities between sensory systems, the age-related neurochemical changes seen throughout the macaque auditory system cannot be fully generalized to other sensory systems.",parvalbumin; thalamus; medial geniculate; lateral geniculate; monkey; geriatric; BINDING PROTEIN IMMUNOREACTIVITY; CALBINDIN D-28K IMMUNOREACTIVITY; CENTRAL AUDITORY-SYSTEM; COCHLEAR NUCLEUS; CALRETININ IMMUNOREACTIVITY; POSITIVE NEURONS; MARMOSET MONKEYS; STRIATE CORTEX; GABA; CONNECTIONS

The injections were placed in the forelimb and eye-movement representations of PMD and in the forelimb representation of PMV as determined by microstimulation mapping. For comparison, injections were also placed in the forelimb representation of primary motor cortex (MI) of two owl monkeys. The results indicate that both PMD and PMV receive dense projections from the ventral lateral (VL) and ventral anterior (VA) thalamus, and sparser projections from the ventromedial (VM), mediodorsal (MD) and intralaminar (IL) nuclei. Labeled neurons in VL were concentrated in the anterior (VLa) and the medial (VLx) nuclei, with only a few labeled cells in the dorsal (VLd) and posterior (VLp) nuclei. In VA, labeled neurons were concentrated in the parvocellular division (VApc) dorsomedial to VLa. Labeled neurons in MD were concentrated in the most lateral and posterior parts of the nucleus. VApc projected more densely to PMD than PMV, especially to rostral PMD, whereas caudal PMD received stronger projections from neurons in VLx and VLa. VLd projected exclusively to PMD, and not to PMV. In addition, neurons labeled by PMD injections tended to be more dorsal in VL, IL, and MD than those labeled by PMV injections. The results indicate that both premotor areas receive indirect inputs from the cerebellum (via VLx, VLd and IL) and globus pallidus (via VLa, VApc, and MD). Comparisons of thalamic projections to premotor and M1 indicate that both regions receive strong projections from VLx and VLa, with the populations of cells projecting to M1 located more laterally in these nuclei. VApc, VLd, and MD project mainly to premotor areas, while VLp projects mainly to M1. Overall, the thalamic connectivity patterns of premotor cortex in New World owl monkeys are similar to those reported for Old World monkeys. (C) 2007 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The purpose of this study was to investigate postoperative transient reduced diffusion in the ipsilateral striatum and thalamus as a remote effect of surgery. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Six hundred two postoperative MR imaging examinations in 125 patients after cerebral surgery were retrospectively reviewed, focusing on the presence of reduced diffusion in the striatum and/or thalamus. The distribution of reduced diffusion in the striatum was classified into 3 groups: anterior, central, and posterior. Reduced diffusion in the thalamus was also classified on the basis of the anatomic locations of the thalamic nuclei. Further follow-up MRI was available in all patients with postoperative reduced diffusion, and acute infarctions were excluded. The patient medical records were reviewed to evaluate neurologic status. RESULTS: Restriction of diffusion was observed in the striatum and/or thalamus ipsilateral to the surgical site in 17 patients (13.6%). The distribution of signal abnormality correlated with the location of the operation, in concordance with the architecture of the striatocortical and thalamocortical connections. Reduced diffusion was observed from days 7 to 46 after the operation, especially during days 8-21. The signal abnormalities completely resolved on follow-up examinations. The median follow-up period was 202 days (interquartile range, 76-487 days). CONCLUSIONS: Postoperative transient reduced diffusion in the ipsilateral striatum and/or thalamus likely represents an early phase of secondary neuronal degeneration based on its characteristic distribution and time course. Clinically, this reduced diffusion should not be mistaken for postoperative ischemic injury.",nan; MIDDLE CEREBRAL-ARTERY; POSTISCHEMIC NEURONAL DEATH; WALLERIAN DEGENERATION; BASAL GANGLIA; SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; MACACA-FASCICULARIS; AMPA RECEPTORS; MR; CORTEX

The cellular features which contribute to the functional specialization of its subsectors are poorly understood. In this study we determined the distribution of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-diaphorase-positive neurons in structurally and functionally distinct prefrontal cortices in the rhesus monkey. This class of neurons express nitric oxide synthase which is necessary for the production of nitric oxide, a novel neural messenger implicated in learning and memory. The density of diaphorase-positive neurons was approximately four times higher in olfactory areas than in eulaminate areas (areas 9, 10, 12, 46, and 8), and two- to three-times higher in the agranular limbic area PAll than in eulaminate areas. Positive neurons were concentrated in a deep band (layers V and VI), a superficial band (layers II and upper III), and were sparsely distributed in the central, thalamic recipient zone (deep layer III, layer IV and upper V). The highest densities of positive neurons were observed in the white matter where their prevalence Followed the opposite trend than in the corresponding overlying cortices. The distribution of diaphorase-positive neurons was correlated with the regional anatomic and functional specialization of prefrontal cortices. Thus, diaphorase-positive neurons were most densely distributed in orbital and then medial prefrontal limbic cortices which have a low cell density and widespread connections. In contrast, positive neurons were comparatively sparse in eulaminate cortices, which have a high cell density and more restricted connections. These findings indicate that the distribution of diaphorase-positive neurons in prefrontal cortices is not random, but is associated with the structural architecture and Functional attributes of these cortices. The preponderance of diaphorase-positive neurons in limbic cortices, which have been implicated in learning and memory, is consistent with the idea that nitric oxide may have a role in synaptic plasticity.",nitric oxide synthase; nitric oxide; limbic cortex; memory; DINUCLEOTIDE-PHOSPHATE-DIAPHORASE; NITRIC-OXIDE SYNTHASE; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; NEUROPEPTIDE-Y; INFEROTEMPORAL CORTEX; HUNTINGTONS-DISEASE; STRIATAL NEURONS; RAT STRIATUM; WHITE MATTER; SELECTIVELY RESISTANT

To compare the expression of cholinesterases in the human thalamus, the distributions of BuChE and AChE activity were studied by using a modified Karnovsky-Roots method. BuChE activity was present mainly in neurons, whereas AChE activity was present in both neurons and axons. There was intense staining for BuChE or AChE throughout the thalamus, with some nuclei primarily expressing one or the other cholinesterase. BuChE staining was most intense and widespread in neurons in the anteroventral, mediodorsal, ventral, lateral, and pulvinar thalamic nuclei. AChE was predominantly expressed in neurons of the anterodorsal, midline, ventral, intralaminar, and reticular nuclei. Many nuclei contained both cholinesterases. Considering the overall patterns of labeling in the thalamus for the two cholinesterases, there were both complementary and overlapping relationships of BuChE and AChE activity. Neuronal staining in the subthalamic nucleus and hypothalamus was predominantly positive for AChE activity. The distinct distribution of BuChE activity in neurons in the human thalamus is consistent with an important role for this enzyme in neurotransmission in the human nervous system. Furthermore, BuChE activity, like AChE activity, is found in certain thalamic nuclei related to cognitive and behavioral functions. Involvement of thalamic nuclei in diseases of the nervous system such as Alzheimer's disease and schizophrenia suggests that BuChE could be a potential target for therapeutic intervention in these disorders.

By combining Bayesian model selection with dynamic causal modeling of functional magnetic resonance imaging data, a novel analysis approach that allows inferring the causality between neural activities in different brain areas, we demonstrate that salient sensory information reaches the multimodal cortical areas responsible for its detection directly from the thalamus, without being first processed in primary and secondary sensory-specific areas. This direct thalamocortical transmission of multimodal salient information is parallel to the processing of finer stimulus attributes, which are transmitted in a modality-specific fashion from the thalamus to the relevant primary sensory areas. Such direct thalamocortical connections bypassing primary sensory cortices provide a fast and efficient way for transmitting information from subcortical structures to multimodal cortical areas, to allow the early detection of salient events and, thereby, trigger immediate and appropriate behavior.",anterior cingulate cortex; dynamic causal modeling; functional magnetic resonance imaging; insular cortex; sensory processing; CINGULATE CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; PAIN MATRIX; COGNITIVE CONJUNCTION; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; HUMAN BRAIN; ATTENTION; SYSTEM; CONNECTIVITY; FMRI

Quantitative evaluation of connections examined with retrogradely transported fluorescent tracers indicated that both gyri received strong thalamic projections from the medial geniculate body (MG) and the lateromedial-suprageniculate (LM-Sg) complex, and a weaker projection from the posterior (Po) nuclei. On the basis of the connectivity patterns and cytoarchitectonic features we distinguished the anterior (CPa) and posterior (CPp) areas in posterior composite gyrus and the anterior (SA), dorsal (SD) and posterior (SP) sylvian areas. Afferents from individual thalamic nuclei were focused in distinct areas, forming dominant projections, and diminished gradually in the adjacent areas as non-dominant projections. The most prominent MG projection arose from the dorsal caudal (MGdc) nucleus. Its ventral subdivision sent a dominant projection into the SP and CPa, whereas the dorsal MGdc subdivision was connected with the SA, SD and CPp areas. The most substantial connections from the LM-Sg complex were directed to areas SA, SD and CPp, with weak connections to areas CPa and SP. A gradient of density of LM-Sg afferents was distributed in the opposite direction to that sent from the MGdc. The origin of the CPa and SP afferents in the ventral MGdc, like connections reaching the posterior ectosylvian cortex, suggest that these areas are related to processing of auditory information. In contrast, areas SA and Up, receive dominant projections from the polymodal LM-Sg, and therefore may constitute successive steps in a hierarchy of cortical areas. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

To study the thalamic connections of this area, injections of several distinguishable neuroanatomical tracers were placed into DM in galagos, owl monkeys, squirrel monkeys, and macaque monkeys. The distribution of label was remarkably consistent across these diverse primate species. Labeled connections were densest within the pulvinar complex. Both the lateral and inferior divisions of the pulvinar, but not the medial division, had connections with DM. Within the inferior pulvinar of monkeys, central lateral and central medial nuclei had dense connections, and the medial and posterior nuclei had sparse connections with DM. Sparser connections were revealed in the lateral geniculate nucleus and the nucleus limitans. Anterograde label was also found in the superior colliculus. The consistencies in the pattern of subcortical projections across prosimian primates, New World monkeys, and Old World monkeys support the concept that DM is a visual area common to all primates.

We examined the reliability of this marker in identifying and discriminating thalamic terminals in adult and developing ferret visual cortex. We studied brain sections stained for the transporter protein and/or anterogradely filled thalamocortical or intracortical axons, by using light, confocal, and electron microscopy. Under light microscopy, VGluT2 immunoreactivity (ir) in adult animals [past postnatal day (P)90] and in neonatal animals as early as P27 formed a dense band in layer 4 and appeared as scattered puncta in layers 6 and 1. Confocal dual-labeling analyses of P46 and adult striate cortices indicated that VGluT2 was present in thalamocortical axons, suggesting that thalamic projections utilize this transporter during postnatal development as well as adulthood. In contrast, extracellularly filled intracortical axons failed to colocalize with VGluT2-ir, suggesting that no significant terminal population originating in cortex contained VGluT2 in layer 4. Electron microscopic analysis revealed that, in adult layer 4, VGluT2-ir was present in large terminals, forming asymmetric synapses. Similar to anterogradely labeled thalamocortical terminals, VGluT2-ir synaptic terminals were different from their unlabeled counterparts in terms of terminal area (0.6 vs. 0.3 mu m), synaptic length (486 vs. 353 nm), and preference for synapsing on spines (77% vs. 59%). Moreover, no significant differences were found between VGluT2-ir and anterogradely labeled thalamocortical terminals. Comparable similarities were also demonstrated at P46. These results indicate that thalamocortical terminals in layer 4 of visual cortex utilize VGluT2 and suggest that this marker can be used to identify thalamic axons specifically in adult and developing animals.

We compared anatomical constituents of macaque V1 with V1 of members of the two principal marsupial lines, the dunnart and the quokka, that diverged from the eutherian mammalian line over 135 million years ago. Features of V1 common to both macaque and marsupials were then compared with anatomical features we have previously described for macaque prefrontal cortex. Despite large differences in overall area and thickness of V1 cortex between these animals, the absolute size of pyramidal neurons is remarkably similar, as are their specific dendritic branch patterns and patterns of distribution of intrinsic axons. Pyramidal neuron patchy connections exist in the supragranular V1 in both the marsupial quokka and macaque as well as in macaque prefrontal cortex. Several specific types of aspinous interneurons are common to area V1 in both marsupial and macaque and are also present in macaque prefrontal cortex. Spiny stellate cells are a common feature of the thalamic-recipient, mid-depth lamina 4 of V1 in all three species. Because these similarities exist despite the very different Lifestyles and evolutionary histories of the animals compared, this finding argues for a highly conserved framework of cellular detail in macaque primary visual cortex rather than convergent evolution of these features.

Methods: Motor excitability was assessed using transcranial magnetic stimulation techniques and electrical peripheral nerve stimulation. Motor function was evaluated by the Nine-Hole-Peg Test and measurement of hand grip strength. The affected side was compared with the non-lesioned side and with an age-matched control group. Results: Patients had a loss of inhibition and an increase of facilitation in the motor cortex of the affected side. The silent period was prolonged and motor function was impaired on the affected side. Conclusions: A thalamic lesion can modulate motor cortical excitability. Significance: This study suggests that, under normal conditions, somatosensory afferents influence inhibitory and excitatory properties in the motor cortex.

Less than 25% of the superficial hSI projecting cells were putatively contacted by terminals of cervical enlargement spinothalamic neurons. These cells were primarily located in ventroposterior lateral, ventroposterior inferior and centrolateral nuclei. Although the number of superficial hSI projecting cells numbered less than 20% of the total hSI projecting cells, their patterns of location and their proportion of overlap with STT terminals within each thalamic nucleus were similar.

To optimize this approach, we proposed to study the involvement of this nucleus in a non-human primate model of mesial temporal lobe seizure. Two macaques were implanted with one chronic electrode into the hippocampus allowing to monitor the ictal activity. Neurons of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus were recorded with a microelectrode inserted acutely. To induce seizures, penicillin was injected into the hippocampus and neuronal activities of the anterior nucleus were analyzed during ictal and interictal periods. The effects of the chemical neuromodulation of the anterior nucleus on the ictal hippocampal activities were studied and electron microscopy analysis was carried out to study morphological modifications induced in the anterior nucleus of the thalamus. Our results demonstrate that the anterior nucleus of the thalamus is directly involved in the pathophysiology of induced seizures since: (1) Electrophysiological study showed an heterogenous excitation during seizure characterized by the appearance of 2 types of neuronal firing response; (2) chemical neuromodulation of the anterior nucleus of the thalamus changed the severity of seizures; (3) morphological modification of the ultrastructure as well as a reduction of synapse density were observed within the ipsilateral anterior nucleus of the thalamus. This study demonstrates that the anterior nucleus of the thalamus is part of the epileptic network activated during temporal lobe seizures and suggests that this nucleus would be valid target for seizure control using deep brain stimulation.

Here we test the functional and anatomical validity of this proposal by comparing data from diffusion tractography, cytoarchitecture and functional imaging. We acquired diffusion imaging data in eleven healthy subjects and performed probabilistic tractography from voxels within the thalamus. Cortical connectivity information was used to divide the thalamus into sub-regions with highest probability of connectivity to distinct cortical areas. The relative volumes of these connectivity-defined sub-regions correlate well with volumetric predictions based on a histological atlas. Previously reported centres of functional activation within the thalamus during motor or executive tasks co-localize within atlas regions showing high probabilities of connection to motor or prefrontal cortices, respectively. This work provides a powerful validation of quantitative grey matter segmentation using diffusion tractography in humans. Co-registering thalamic sub-regions from 11 healthy individuals characterizes inter-individual variation in segmentation and results in a population-based atlas of the human thalamus that can be used to assign likely anatomical labels to thalamic locations in standard brain space. This provides a tool for specific localization of functional activations or lesions to putative thalamic nuclei.",atlas; cytoarchitecture; diffusion imaging; FMRI; neocortex; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL SULCUS; WORKING-MEMORY; HUMAN BRAIN; CORTICOTHALAMIC CONNECTIONS; RHESUS-MONKEY; FINGER MOVEMENTS; BASAL GANGLIA; PET

Here we show that of the two major types of excitatory neurons existing in L6, the NTSR1-Cre line selectively targets those whose axons innervate both cortex and thalamus and not those whose axons remain within the cortex. These corticothalamic neurons mediate widespread inhibition across all cortical layers by recruiting fast-spiking inhibitory neurons whose cell body resides in deep cortical layers yet whose axons arborize throughout all layers. This study reveals a circuit by which L6 modulates cortical activity and identifies an inhibitory neuron able to regulate the strength of cortical responses throughout cortical depth.",nan; PRIMARY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; INTERLAMINAR CONNECTIONS; ANATOMICAL ORGANIZATION; STRIATE CORTEX; END-INHIBITION; AREA 17; CAT; CIRCUITS; RAT

All areas of the neocortex receive afferent input from and send efferent projections to specific thalamic nuclei. Through these connections, the thalamus serves to provide the cortex with sensory input, and to facilitate interareal cortical communication and motor and cognitive functions. In the visual system, the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the dorsal thalamus is the gateway through which visual information reaches the cerebral cortex. Visual processing in the LGN includes spatial and temporal influences on visual signals that serve to adjust response gain, transform the temporal structure of retinal activity patterns, and increase the signal-to-noise ratio of the retinal signal while preserving its basic content.

However, their functional relationship remains to be elucidated. Here, we employ resting-state functional MRI to investigate the temporal correlations of spontaneous fluctuations between the thalamus [the whole thalamus and its three largest nuclei (bilateral mediodorsal, ventrolateral and pulvinar nuclei)] and visual cortex under both eyes open and eyes closed conditions. The whole thalamus show negative correlations with the visual cortex and positive correlations with its contralateral counterpart in eyes closed condition, but which are significantly decreased in eyes open condition, consistent with previous findings of electroencephalography desynchronization during eyes open resting state. Furthermore, we find that bilateral thalamic mediodorsal nuclei and bilateral ventrolateral nuclei have remarkably similar connectivity maps, and resemble to those of the whole thalamus, suggesting their crucial contributions to the thalamus-visual correlations. The bilateral pulvinar nuclei are found to show distinct functional connectivity patterns, compatible with previous findings of the asymmetry of anatomical and functional organization in the nuclei. Our data provides evidence for the associations of intrinsic spontaneous neuronal activity between the thalamus and visual cortex under different resting conditions, which might have implications on the understanding of the generation and modulation of the alpha rhythm.

It is divided into multiple subnuclei with different cortical connections. The medial dorsal (MD) nucleus is particularly important because it forms key connections with the prefrontal cortex. The current study reports precise and efficient methods for measuring the whole thalamus and the MD with MRI that have a high degree of interrater reliability. A multispectral image acquisition and novel image processing technique were used to improve structure visibility. The tricolor image assigns a color to each of the T1, T2, and PD weighted images, represented by red, green, and blue, respectively. The manually defined regions were then used to train an artificial neural network (ANN) to automatically define both. the whole thalamus and the MD.

One hundred 5-HT immunoreactive terminals from the cat and approximately forty 5-HT and TH immunoreactive terminals from the monkey were selected for analysis in serial thin sections. Only 7-10% of the immunoreactive terminals could be revealed to form conventional synaptic contacts. Most of these could be identified as the asymmetrical type. Dendritic shafts belonging to relay neurons were the major targets of these monoamine immunoreactive terminals. The remainder made intimate membrane associations with relay cell dendrites and somata or with presynaptic dendrites of interneurons, but no overt membrane specializations could be detected.

Taking advantage of the extensive characterization of the macaque visual system, we examine in macaque the influence of congenital blindness resulting from the removal of the retina during in utero development. This effectively removes the normal influence of the thalamus on cortical development leading to an induced hybrid cortex (HC) combining features of primary visual and extrastriate cortex. Retrograde tracers injected in HC reveal a local, intrinsic connectivity characteristic of higher order areas and show that the HC receives a uniquely strong, purely feedforward projection from striate cortex but no ectopic inputs, except from subiculum, and entorhinal cortex. Statistical modeling of quantitative connectivity data shows that HC is relatively high in the cortical hierarchy and receives a reinforced input from ventral stream areas while the overall organization of the functional streams are conserved. The directed and weighted anophthalmic cortical graph from the present study can be used to construct dynamic and structural models. These findings show how the sensory periphery governs cortical phenotype and reveal the importance of developmental arealization for understanding the functional reorganization in congenital blindness.",vision; plasticity; primate; thalamus; CELL-CYCLE KINETICS; VISUAL-CORTEX; CORTICAL AREAS; WHITE-MATTER; BILATERAL ENUCLEATION; CALLOSAL CONNECTIONS; NEURAL FRAMEWORK; ORGANIZATION; DIFFUSION; ACTIVATION

In all of the tasks tested, T-maze alternation, radial arm maze, and Morris water maze, those animals with lesions placed in the contralateral hemispheres were more impaired than those animals with lesions in the same hemisphere.

Here we report the results of quantitative PET studies of cerebral nAChRs with 2-[F-18]fluoro-A-85380 (2-[F-18]FA) in rhesus monkeys. Data from dynamic PET scans were analyzed using graphical methods. Binding potential (BP) values of 2.0, 0.4, 0.3, and 0.03 observed in the thalamus (Th), cortex (Cx), striatum (Str), and cerebellum (Cb), respectively, were consistent with the pattern of alpha(4)beta(2), nAChR distribution in monkey brain. The high value of 2-[F-18]FA-specific binding in the rhesus monkey Th and low level of that in Cb compared with nonspecific accumulation of radioactivity in these structures allowed use of Cb as a reference region for calculation of BP and volume of distribution of specific binding (VDsb) in Th by graphical methods, both with and without the plasma input function. In contrast, estimation of 2[F-18]FA specific binding in low-receptor-density regions such as Cx and Str required assessment of nondisplaceable volume of distribution (VDnd) in a separate study and measurement of nonmetabolized radioligand concentrations in the plasma. For accurate quantitation of 2-[F-18]FA-specific binding by graphical analysis, PET studies should last up to 7 h due to the slow kinetics of 2[F-18]FA brain distribution. Further, to avoid substantial underestimation in measured BP values the doses of administered 2-[F-18]FA should not exceed 0.1 nmol/kg body weight. The findings suggest that 2-[F-18]FA is a promising ligand for quantitation of nAChRs in human brain.",positron emission tomography; nonhuman primates; radioligand; in vivo binding; PET; RADIOLIGAND; TRACER

Their functional importance is largely unknown, but they have both corticothalamic and corticocortical connectivity and at least one subpopulation has been implicated in vascular regulation and sleep. Several other studies have reported that the density of WMNs in humans is altered in neuropathological or psychiatric conditions. The present investigation evaluates and compares the density of superficial and deep WMNs in frontal (FR), temporal (TE), and parietal (Par) association regions of four young adult and four aged male rhesus monkeys. A major aim was to determine whether there was age-related neuronal loss, as might be expected given the substantial age related changes known to occur in the surrounding white matter environment. Neurons were visualized by immunocytochemistry for Neu-N in coronal tissue sections (30 vim thickness), and neuronal density was assessed by systematic random sampling. Per 0.16 mm(2) sampling box, this yielded about 40 neurons in the superficial WM and 10 in the deep WM. Consistent with multiple studies of cell density in the cortical gray matter of normal brains, neither the superficial nor deep WM populations showed statistically significant age-related neuronal loss, although we observed a moderate decrease with age for the deep WMNs in the frontal region. Morphometric analyses, in contrast, showed significant age effects in soma size and circularity. In specific, superficial WMNs were larger in FR and Par WM regions of the young monkeys; but in the TE. these were larger in the older monkeys. An age effect was also observed for soma circularity: superficial WMNs were more circular in FR and Par of the older monkeys. This second, morphometric result raises the question of whether other age-related morphological, connectivity, or molecular changes occur in the WMNs. These could have multiple impacts, given the wide range of putative WMN functions and their involvement in both corticothalamic and corticocortical circuitry.",interstitial; morphometrics; non-human primate; aging; Neu-N; HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; Y-IMMUNOREACTIVE NEURONS; LOCAL CIRCUIT NEURONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SUBPLATE NEURONS; NEUROPEPTIDE-Y; VISUAL-CORTEX; DEVELOPMENTAL HISTORY; INTERSTITIAL NEURONS; COGNITIVE DECLINE

Using diffusion tensor imaging and tract-based spatial statistics, social status differences were found in medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) WM and cortico-thalamic tracts, with subordinates showing higher WM structural integrity (measured as fractional anisotropy, FA) than dominant animals. 5HTT genotype-related differences were detected in the posterior limb of the internal capsule, where s-variants had higher FA than I/I animals. Status by 5HTT interaction effects were found in (1) external capsule (middle longitudinal fasciculus), (2) parietal WM, and (3) short-range PFC tracts, with opposite effects in dominant and subordinate animals. In most regions showing FA differences, opposite differences were detected in radial diffusivity, but none in axial diffusivity, suggesting that differences in tract integrity likely involve differences in myelin. These findings highlight that differences in social rank are associated with differences in WM structural integrity in juveniles, particularly in tracts connecting prefrontal, sensory processing, motor and association regions, sometimes modulated by 5HTT genotype. Differences in these tracts were associated with increased emotional reactivity in subordinates, particularly with higher submissive and fear behaviors.",diffusion tensor imaging; emotional behavior; nonhuman primates; prepuberty; social stress; DIFFUSION TENSOR MRI; GENE-ENVIRONMENT INTERACTIONS; EARLY-LIFE STRESS; RHESUS-MONKEYS; REUPTAKE TRANSPORTER; SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS; PROMOTER REGION; SEX-DIFFERENCES; MACACA-MULATTA; 5-HTTLPR POLYMORPHISM

As with a cable, spine neck resistance (Rneck) increases with increasing neck length and is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area of the neck. A synaptic current entering a spine with a high Rneck will lead to greater local depolarization in the spine head than would a similar input applied to a spine with a lower Rneck. This could make spines with high Rneck more sensitive to plastic changes since voltage sensitive conductances, such as N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) channels can be more easily activated. This hypothesis was tested using serial section electron microscopic reconstructions of thalamocortical spine synapses and spine necks located on spiny stellate cells and corticothalamic cells from area 17 of cats. Thalamic axons and corticothalamic neurons were labeled by injections of the tracer biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of anesthetized cats and spiny stellates were filled intracellularly in vivo with horseradish peroxidase. Twenty-eight labeled spines that formed synapses with dLGN boutons were collected from three spiny stellate and four corticothalamic cells and reconstructed in 3D from serial electron micrographs. Spine length, spine diameter, and the area of the postsynaptic density were measured from the 3D reconstructions and Rneck of the spine was estimated. No correlation was found between the postsynaptic density size and the estimated spine Rneck. This suggests that forms of plasticity that lead to larger synapses are independent of spine neck resistance. J. Comp. Neurol. 521:20582066, 2013.

In addition, this view stales that striatal output reaches the basal ganglia output nuclei (the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNR) and the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GP(i))) via a 'direct' pathway and via an 'indirect pathway' which traverses the external segment of the globus pallidus (GP,) and the subthalamic nucleus (STN). However, the topographical relationships of GP(e) and STN, and their topographical relationships with the basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuit, are still unclear. The present work reviewed primate data on the topographical organization of STN afferents from GP(e), and STN efferents to the pallidum, striatum and SNR, and examined these data with respect to a tripartite (motor, associative and limbic) functional subdivision of the striatum and pallidum. This examination indicated the following. (I) On the basis of its efferent connections, the STN may be divided into a motor and an associative territories, as well as a smaller limbic territory, each projecting to corresponding areas in the pallidum and striatum. (2) Efferents from GP(e) are in a position to contact subthalamic cells projecting to GP(i)/SNR, thus providing anatomical support for the existence of indirect pathways. (3) Moreover, given the tripartite division of the striatum, pallidum, and STN, the available data indicate the existence of indirect pathways connecting functionally corresponding subregions of the striatum, pallidum, and STN, as well as indirect pathways connecting functionally non-corresponding subregions. On the basis of the above we suggested that there may be two types of indirect pathways, one which terminates in the same subregion in GP(i)/SNR as the direct pathway arising from the same striatal subregion, and another which terminates in a different GP(i)/SNR subregion than the direct pathway arising from the same striatal subregion. We termed the former a 'closed indirect pathway' and the latter an 'open indirect pathway'. The application of these concepts to the surveyed data suggested the existence of three closed indirect pathways, each connecting the corresponding functional (motor, associative, and limbic) regions of the striatum, pallidum, STN, and SNR, as well as of two open indirect pathways, one connecting the associative striatum to the motor subregions of the basal ganglia, and the other connecting the associative striatum to the limbic subregions of the basal ganglia. While the organization of the closed indirect pathways fits the closed segregated arrangement of basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuitry, the organization of the open indirect pathways fits the recently suggested open interconnected scheme of basal ganglia thalamocortical circuitry.

Most LGN neurons are monocular in that they are activated by visual stimulation through only one (dominant) eye. However, there are both intrinsic connections and inputs from binocular structures to the LGN that could provide these neurons with signals originating from the other (non-dominant) eye. Indeed, previous work introducing luminance differences across the eyes or using a single-contrast stimulus showed binocular modulation for single unit activity in anesthetized macaques and multiunit activity in awake macaques. Here, we sought to determine the influence of contrast viewed by both the non-dominant and dominant eyes on LGN single-unit responses in awake macaques. To do this, we adjusted each eye's signal strength by independently varying the contrast of stimuli presented to the two eyes. Specifically, we recorded LGN single unit spiking activity in two awake macaques while they viewed drifting gratings of varying contrast. We found that LGN neurons of all types [parvocellular (P), magnocellular (M), and koniocellular (K)] were significantly suppressed when stimuli were presented at low contrast to the dominant eye and at high contrast to the non-dominant eye. Further, the inputs of the two eyes showed antagonistic interaction, whereby the magnitude of binocular suppression diminished with high contrast in the dominant eye, or low contrast in the non-dominant eye. These results suggest that the LGN represents a site of precortical binocular processing involved in resolving discrepant contrast differences between the eyes.",binocular; interocular suppression; lateral geniculate nucleus; macaque; monocular; vision; RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; CONTRAST-SENSITIVITY; GAIN-CONTROL; MONKEY; SUMMATION; NEURONS; RIVALRY; COMPONENTS

Spike activity of 67 neurons (48 simple, 19 complex cells) was extracellulary recorded from area 17/18 of anesthetized and paralyzed cats. A total of 107 subfields (on/off) were mapped by applying, a reverse correlation technique to the activity elicited by bright and dark rectangles flashed for 300 ms in a 20 x 10 grid. We found that the width of the (suprathreshold) discharge fields shrank on average by 22% during this 300-ms-long stimulus presentation time. Fifty-eight subfields (54%) shrank by more than 20% of peak width and only ten (less than 10%) showed a slight increase over time. The main size reduction took place 40-60 ms after response onset, which corresponded to the transition from transient peak firing to tonic visual activity in thalamocortical relay cells (TC). The experimentally obtained RFs were then fitted with the aid of a neural field model of the primary visual pathway. Assuming a Gaussian-shaped spatial sensitivity profile across the RF subfield width, the model allowed us to estimate the subthreshold RF (depolarization field, D-field) from the minimal discharge field (MDF). The model allowed us to test to what degree the temporal dynamics of thalamocortical activity contributes to the spatiotemporal changes of cortical RFs. To this end, we performed the fitting procedure either with a pure feedforward model or with a field model that also included intracortical feedback. Spatial and temporal parameters obtained from fits of the experimental RFs matched closely to those achieved by simulating a pure feedforward system with the field model but were not compatible with additional intracortical feedback. Thus, our results show that dot stimulation, which optimally excites thalamocortical cells, leads to a shrinkage with respect to the size of the RF subfield at the first transient response of visual cortical RFs which seems mainly due to a change in the thalamic firing pattern. In these experiments little or no influence from intracortical sources was observed, which, however, may play a role when using more complex visual stimuli.",thalamocortical response dynamics; cortical spatiotemporal receptive field dynamics; field model; depolarization field; discharge field; cat; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; MACAQUE STRIATE CORTEX; SIMPLE CELLS; ORIENTATION SELECTIVITY; CORTICAL-NEURONS; AREA 17; GENICULOCORTICAL AFFERENTS; DIRECTION SELECTIVITY; SYNAPTIC INTEGRATION; ORGANIZATION

Activated macrophages and microglia in white matter along with the hallmark multinucleated giant cells are prominent features of HIV encephalitis (HIVE) and of several simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) models. While infected microglia have been demonstrated in HIVE, this feature is not routinely seen in experimental infections in rhesus macaques using SIV or chimeric simian/HIV (SHIV) strains, limiting utility in HIV-1 pathogenesis and treatment studies. Here, 50 rhesus macaques were inoculated with the CCR5 (R5)-tropic SHIVSF162P3N virus by one of three routes: intravenously (n = 9), intrarectally (n = 17), or intravaginally (n = 24). Forty-three monkeys became viremic, 26 developed AIDS, and 7 (7/26, 27 %) developed giant cell SIV encephalitis (SIVE). Rapid progressor phenotype was evident in five of seven (71 %) macaques with SIVE, and expansion to utilize the CXCR4 coreceptor (X4 coreceptor switch) was observed in four out of seven (57 %). SIVE lesions were present in gray and white matter in the cerebrum, cerebellum, thalamus, and brain stem of affected animals. Lesions were composed of virally infected CD68(+), CD163(+), and HLA-DR+ macrophages accompanied by white matter damage, necrosis, and astroglial and microglial activation. Importantly, microglial infection was observed, which makes R5 SHIVSF162P3N infection of macaques an attractive animal model not only to study transmission and HIVE pathogenesis but also to conduct preclinical evaluation of therapeutic interventions aimed at eradicating HIV-1 from the central nervous system (CNS).",HIV; SHIV; Rhesus macaque; Neuropathogenesis; CCR5; Encephalitis; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY; HIV-1 INFECTION; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; IMMUNE ACTIVATION; CNS PENETRATION; BRAIN; REPLICATION; MACROPHAGES

Calcyon mRNA is found to be abundantly distributed throughout the primate brain. In neocortex, moderately dense, diffuse signal is found in all areas, with increased intensity present in a superficial isodense band corresponding generally to cortical layers II and III. Increased intensity of signal is also seen in the pyramidal cell layers of medial prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex. Calcyon mRNA is present abundantly in subcortical limbic areas such as the nucleus accumbens, septum, hypothalamus, amygdala, and hippocampus. Moderate calcyon transcript expression is seen in caudate and putamen, with lower levels in globus pallidus. Thalamic nuclei, including the reticular nucleus, express low to moderate levels. Very dense expression is noted in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Numerous brainstem regions express this transcript, notably monoaminergic nuclei including the locus coeruleus and dorsal raphe. The cerebellum has detectable levels of expression in both cortex and deep nuclei. Although calcyon is hypothesized as a means for D1-like receptors to modulate cross-talk with other neurotransmitter receptor systems, it is notable that abundant calcyon transcript is detected in brain regions not associated with D1-like neurotransmission, particularly the substantia nigra pars compacta and other dopamine-synthesizing cell groups. A substantial proportion of this may relate to the reported association of calcyon with the D5 receptor, or in addition, may suggest that calcyon has a wider role as a regulator of intracellular signal transduction.

However, it is unclear how specific thalamic nuclei are affected by these changes in basal ganglia activity. The thalamic parafascicular nucleus (PFN) receives input from basal ganglia Output nuclei and directly projects to the subthalamic nucleus (STN), striatum and cortex; thus basal ganglia-mediated changes on PFN activity may further impact basal ganglia and cortical functions. To investigate the impact of increased oscillatory activity in basal ganglia output on PFN activity after dopamine cell lesion, PFN single-unit and local field potential activities were recorded in neurologically intact (control) rats and in both non-lesioned and dopamine lesioned hemispheres of unilateral 6-hydroxydopamine lesioned rats anesthetized With urethane. Firing rates were unchanged 1-2 weeks after lesion; however, significantly fewer spontaneously active PFN neurons were evident. Firing pattern assessments after lesion showed that a larger proportion of PFN spike trains had 0.3-2.5 Hz oscillatory activity and significantly fewer spike trains exhibited low threshold calcium spike (LTS) bursts. In paired recordings, more PFN-STN spike oscillations were significantly correlated, but as these oscillations were in-phase, results are inconsistent with feedforward control of PFN activity by inhibitory oscillatory basal ganglia output. Furthermore, the decreased incidence of ITS bursts is incompatible with inhibitory basal ganglia output inducing rebound bursting in PFN after dopamine lesion. Together, results show that robust oscillatory activity observed in basal ganglia output nuclei after dopamine cell lesion does not directly drive changes in PFN oscillatory activity.

This atlas is based on multiarchitectonic parcellation in sections parallel or perpendicular to the standard intercommissural reference plane. The calcium-binding proteins parvalbumin (PV), calbindin D-28K (CB), and calretinin (CR) were used as neurochemical markers to further characterize thalamic nuclei and delimit subterritories of functional significance for stereotactic explorations. Their overall distribution reveals a subcompartmentalization of thalamic nuclei into several groups. Predominant PV immunostaining characterizes primary somatosensory, visual and auditory nuclei, the ventral lateral posterior nucleus, reticular nucleus (R), and to a lesser degree also, lateral part of the centre median nucleus, and anterior, lateral, and inferior divisions of the pulvinar complex. In contrast, CB immunoreactivity is prevalent in medial thalamic nuclei (intralaminar and midline), the posterior complex, ventral posterior inferior nucleus, the ventral lateral anterior nucleus, ventral anterior, and ventral medial nuclei. The complementary distributions of PV and CB appear to correlate with distinct lemniscal and spinothalamic somatosensory pathways and to cerebellar and pallidal motor territories, respectively. Calretinin, while overlapping with CB in medial thalamic territories, is also expressed in R and limbic associated anterior group nuclei that contain little or no CB. Preliminary analysis indicates that interindividual nuclear variations cannot easily be taken into account by standardization procedures. Nevertheless, some corrections in anteroposterior coordinates in relation to different intercommissural distances are proposed. J. Comp. Neurol. 387:588-630, 1997.

These neurones project predominantly to the primary motor cortex after relaying in the motor thalamus. Given a) that localised regions of the motor cortex control individual muscles which generally act about single joints and b) the relatively tight topographical arrangement of thalamocortical connections, it is reasonable to hypothesise that if cerebellar output neurones control single-joint movements they are likely to project to localised areas of the motor thalamus, whereas if they project to more widespread regions they are likely to influence movements involving multiple joints. In this context, we have examined the ramifications and terminations of single anterogradely labelled axons in the cerebellothalamic pathway of the rat. A total of nine axons were traced (by using a 100x oil objective) through serial sections from the caudal end of the thalamus to their terminations in the motor thalamus. Each of these axons gave off one or more collaterals which terminated in the intralaminar or other associated groups of thalamic nuclei, implying simultaneous activation of two functionally separate cerebellothalamic pathways. In the relay nucleus or motor thalamus, four axons formed either a single focal group of terminals or multiple groupings of terminals within a localised region, and five terminated over widespread regions including one which terminated bilaterally. These results show that a large proportion of cerebellar output neurones may be in a position to influence multi-joint or even bimanual movements.

Immunocytochemical analyses, combined with computerized morphometry revealed that in the visual and auditory systems of the bottlenose dolphin, calretinin and calbindin are the prevalent calcium-binding proteins, whereas parvalbumin is present in very few neurons. The prevalence of calretinin and calbindin-immunoreactive neurons is especially obvious in the auditory system of this species. In both auditory and visual systems of the macaque monkey, the parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons are present in comparable or higher densities than the calretinin and calbindin-immunoreactive neurons. In some structures of the visual and auditory systems of the macaque monkey, the calretinin- and calbindin-immunoreactive neurons are nearly absent. The prevalence of parvalbumin-immunoreactive over calretinin- and calbindin-immunoreactive neurons is particularly prominent in the visual system of primates. Thus, the dominant sensory systems in both aquatic and terrestrial mammals are enriched in specific phenotypes of calcium-binding protein-immunoreactive neurons. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

The mismatch response, or mismatch negativity (MMN), is a neurophysiologic response to stimulus change. In humans and other animals, the MMN may underlie the ability to discriminate acoustic differences, a fundamental aspect of auditory perception. 2. This study investigated the role of the thalamus in the generation of a tone-evoked MMN in guinea pigs. Electrodes were placed in the caudomedial (nonprimary) and ventral (primary) subdivisions of the auditory thalamus (medial geniculate nucleus). Surface epidural electrodes were placed at the midline and over the temporal lobe. The MMN was elicited by a deviant stimulus (2,450-Hz tone burst) embedded in a sequence of standard stimuli (2,300-Hz tone bursts). 3. A tone-evoked MMN was present in nonprimary thalamus but was absent in the primary thalamus. Surface-recorded MMNs were measured at the midline but not over the temporal lobe. The correspondence between nonprimary thalamic responses and midline surface potentials, and between primary thalamic responses and temporal surface potentials, is consistent with data reported for the auditory middle latency responses in guinea pigs. 4. The results demonstrate that the nonprimary auditory thalamus contributes to the generation of a tone-evoked MMN in the guinea pig. Furthermore, the data indicate that the guinea pig is a feasible model for investigating central auditory processes underlying acoustic discrimination.",nan; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; MEDIAL GENICULATE-BODY; MIDDLE LATENCY RESPONSE; MISMATCH NEGATIVITY; GUINEA-PIG; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; STIMULUS DEVIANCE; JAPANESE MACAQUES; GENERATING-SYSTEM; CORTEX LESIONS

Though IT traditionally has been regarded as lacking retinotopy, several recent studies in monkeys have shown that retinotopic maps extend to face patches along the lower bank of the superior temporal sulcus (STS) and neighboring regions of IT cortex. Here, we used fMRI to map the retinotopic organization of medial ventral temporal cortex in four monkeys (2 male and 2 female). We confirm the presence of visual field maps within and around the lower bank of the STS and extend these prior findings to scene-selective cortex in the ventral-most regions of IT. Within the occipitotemporal sulcus (OTS), we identified two retinotopic areas, OTS1 and OTS2. The polar angle representation of OTS2 was a mirror reversal of the OTS1 representation. These regions contained representations of the contralateral periphery and were selectively active for scene versus face, body, or object images. The extent of this retinotopy parallels that in humans and shows that the organization of the scene network is preserved across primate species. In addition retinotopic maps were identified in dorsal extrastriate, posterior parietal, and frontal cortex as well as the thalamus, including both the lateral geniculate nucleus and pulvinar. Together, it appears that most, if not all, of the macaque visual system contains organized representations of visual space.",IT; macaque; organization; retinotopy; scenes; vision; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; PRIMATE CEREBRAL-CORTEX; SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; FIELD MAP CLUSTERS; TOPOGRAPHIC ORGANIZATION; VISUAL-CORTEX; VISUOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; FUNCTIONAL MRI; OCCIPITOTEMPORAL CORTEX

The dopaminergic system is of particular interest due to its role in the development of cognitive function and mood as well as its suspected involvement in neuropsychiatric illness. Nonhuman primate animal models provide a valuable resource for relating neurochemical changes to behavior. To facilitate comparison within and between primate models, we report in vivo D2/D3 binding in a large cohort of adolescent rhesus monkeys. Methods: In this work, the in vivo D2/D3 dopamine receptor availability was measured in a cohort of 33 rhesus monkeys in the adolescent stage of development (3.2-5.3 years). Both striatal and extrastriatal D2/D3 binding were measured using [F-18]fallypride with a high resolution small animal PET scanner. The distribution volume ratio (DVR) was measured for all subjects and group comparisons of D2/D3 binding among the cohort were made based on age and sex. Because two sequential studies were acquired from a single [F-18]fallypride batch, the effect of competing (unlabeled) ligand mass was also investigated. Results: Among this cohort, the rank order of regional D2/D3 receptor binding did not vary from previous studies with adult rhesus monkeys, with: putamen>caudate>ventral striatum>amygdala similar to substantia nigra>medial dorsal thalamus>lateral temporal cortex similar to frontal cortex. The DVR coefficient of variation ranged from 14%-26%, with the greatest variance seen in the head of the caudate. There were significant sex differences in [F-18]fallypride kinetics in the pituitary gland, but this was not observed for regions within the blood-brain barrier. Furthermore, no regions in the brain showed significant sex or age related differences in DVR within this small age range. Based on a wide range of injected fallypride mass across the cohort, significant competition effects could only be detected in the substantia nigra, thalamus, and frontal cortex, and were not evident above intersubject variability in all other regions. Conclusion: These data represent the first report of large cohort in vivo D2/D3 dopamine whole brain binding in the adolescent brain and will serve as a valuable comparison for understanding dopamine changes during this critical time of development and provide a framework for creating a dopaminergic biochemical atlas for the rhesus monkey.

In 2 monkeys, injections were centered on the lateral VTA with some spread into the substantia nigra, while in one animal the injection targeted the medial VTA with partial spread into the ventro-medial thalamus. Double-labeling with antibodies against transduced fluorescent proteins (FPs) and tyrosine hydroxylase indicated that substantial portions of transduced midbrain neurons were dopaminergic. Interestingly, cortical terminals were found either homogeneously in molecular layer I, or more heterogeneously, sometimes forming patches, in the deeper laminae II-VI. In the animals with injections in lateral VTA, terminals were most dense in somatomotor cortex and the striatum. In contrast, when the medial VTA was transduced, dense terminals were found in dorsal prefrontal and temporal cortices, while projections to striatum were sparse. In all monkeys, orbitofrontal and occipito-parietal cortex received strong and weak innervation, respectively. Thus, the dopaminergic ventral midbrain sends heterogeneous projections throughout the brain. Furthermore, our results suggest the existence of subgroups in meso-dopaminergic neurons depending on their location in the primate ventral midbrain.",AAV; anterograde projection; dopamine; immunohistochemistry; Macaca fuscata; VTA; PRIMATE CEREBRAL-CORTEX; TYROSINE-HYDROXYLASE; DOPAMINERGIC INNERVATION; TEGMENTAL AREA; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; REGIONAL-DISTRIBUTION; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; NEURONS

Still, its physiology is poorly understood. In this study, we used microelectrodes and macroelectrodes in surgical epilepsy patients to measure the intracortical and thalamic generators of the alpha rhythm during quiet wakefulness. We first found that alpha in both visual and somatosensory cortex propagates from higher-order to lower-order areas. In posterior cortex, alpha propagates from higher-order anterosuperior areas toward the occipital pole, whereas alpha in somatosensory cortex propagates from associative regions toward primary cortex. Several analyses suggest that this cortical alpha leads pulvinar alpha, complicating prevailing theories of a thalamic pacemaker. Finally, alpha is dominated by currents and firing in supragranular cortical layers. Together, these results suggest that the alpha rhythm likely reflects short-range supragranular feedback, which propagates from higher- to lower-order cortex and cortex to thalamus. These physiological insights suggest how alpha could mediate feedback throughout the thalamocortical system.",alpha; oscillations; intracranial EEG; laminar; thalamocortical; OSCILLATIONS PREDICTS; NEURONAL MECHANISMS; LAMINAR PROFILE; GAMMA; PHASE; EEG; CORTEX; INFORMATION; INHIBITION; MONKEY

However, it is becoming clear that given the same stress, some individuals are very vulnerable and will succumb to illness while others are more resilient and cope effectively, rather than becoming ill. This difference between individuals is called stress sensitivity. Stress sensitivity of an individual appears to be influenced by genetically inherited factors, early life (even prenatal) stress, and by the presence or absence of factors that provide protection from stress. In comparison to other stress-related diseases, the concept of sensitivity versus resilience to stress-induced reproductive dysfunction has received relatively little attention. The studies presented herein were undertaken to begin to identify stable characteristics and the neural underpinnings of individuals with sensitivity to stress-induced reproductive dysfunction. Female cynomolgus macaques with normal menstrual cycles either stop ovulating (stress sensitive) or to continue to ovulate (stress resilient) upon exposure to a combined metabolic and psychosocial stress. However, even in the absence of stress, the stress-sensitive animals have lower secretion of the ovarian steroids, estrogen and progesterone, have higher heart rates, have lower serotonin function, have fewer serotonin neurons and lower expression of pivotal serotonin-related genes, have lower expression of 5HT2A and 2C genes in the hypothalamus, have higher gene expression of GAD67 and CRH in the hypothalamus, and have reduced gonadotropin-releasing hormone transport to the anterior pituitary. Altogether, the results suggest that the neurobiology of reproductive circuits in stress-sensitive individuals is compromised. We speculate that with the application of stress, the dysfunction of these neural systems becomes exacerbated and reproductive function ceases.",Reproduction; Stress; Serotonin; Corticotropin-releasing hormone; Pro-opiomelanocortin; Beta-endorphin; Paraventricular nucleus; Thalamus; Amygdala; Cynomolgus macaque; CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING HORMONE; PULSATILE LUTEINIZING-HORMONE; FUNCTIONAL HYPOTHALAMIC AMENORRHEA; ENDOGENOUS OPIOID-PEPTIDES; GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRIC-ACID; CENTRAL SEROTONERGIC RESPONSIVITY; OVARIECTOMIZED RHESUS-MONKEY; MESSENGER-RIBONUCLEIC-ACID; 5-DAY ENDOTOXIN CHALLENGE; ESTROGEN-RECEPTOR-ALPHA

Peak levels of radioactivity were measured in brain at 90 min after injection of the tracer. Accumulation of radioactivity was highest in the thalamus, intermediate in the frontal cortex and basal ganglia, and lowest in the cerebellum. The ratio of specific to nonspecific binding (V-3) in the thalamus, estimated from the (thalamic - cerebellar)/cerebellar radioactivity ratio, reached a value of 6 at 4 h post-injection. Specific binding was reduced by subcutaneous injection of 1 mg/kg cytisine at 2.25 h after injection of radiotracer. At 2.5 h after cytisine administration, radioactivity in the thalamus was reduced by 84 %, in the frontal cortex, by 76%, and in the basal ganglia, by 57 % of the level measured at the time of cytisine administration, demonstrating that the binding was reversible. On the basis of these findings, together with other data indicating high affinity, receptor subtype selectivity, low nonspecific binding and lack of toxicity in animals, 5-[I-123]iodo-A-85380 appears to be a promising ligand for SPECT imaging of nAChRs in the human brain.

Many of these maps are arranged in a discontinuous or patchy manner. Similarly, thalamocortical projections arising from the ventral division of the medial geniculate body to the primary auditory cortex are also patchy. We used anterograde labeling and electrophysiological methods to examine the relationship between thalamocortical patches and auditory cortical maps. Biotinylated dextran-amine was deposited into physiologically characterized sites in the ventral division of the medial geniculate body of New Zealand white rabbits. Approximately 7 d later, the animal was again anesthetized and the ipsilateral auditory cortex was mapped with tungsten microelectrodes. Multi-unit physiological data were obtained for the following characteristics: best frequency (BF), binaurality, response type, latency, sharpness of tuning, and threshold. Immunocytochemical methods were used to reveal the injection site in the ventral division of the medial geniculate body as well as the anterogradely labeled thalamocortical afferents in the auditory cortex. In 86% of the cases (12 of 14), entry into a thalamocortical patch was associated with a marked change in physiological responses. A consistent BF and binaural class were usually observed within a patch. The patches appear to innervate distinct functional regions coding frequency and binaurality.

Using retrograde transneuronal transfer of rabies virus in combination with a conventional tracer, we studied direct and polysynaptic inputs to the ventral lateral intraparietal area (LIPv) and medial intraparietal area (MIP) in non-human primates, to identify possible sources of eye position and gaze signals. We found that these areas receive disynaptic inputs from the brainstem horizontal eye position integrator network (nucleus prepositus hypoglossi, PH) via the central lateral and ventral lateral thalamic nuclei. Our findings provide the first demonstration that inputs from the horizontal eye position integrator reach cortical areas. We found important topographical differences between PH populations targeting MIP and LIPv that likely reflect transmission of different types of eye movement signals. LIPv receives projections from the ipsilateral rostral PH, which may transmit ipsilateral eye position signals. In addition to inputs from the rostral PH, MIP receives strong projections from the contralateral caudal PH, which may contribute to both eye position and velocity signals. Unlike the horizontal integrator, we found that the vertical eye position integrator network, the interstitial nucleus of Cajal, does not project to these posterior parietal areas, in keeping with findings that the thalamic nuclei targeting LIPv and MIP receive almost exclusively horizontal oculomotor signals.",eye movements; monkey; rabies; spatial updating; transneuronal; LATERAL INTRAPARIETAL AREA; SACCADE-RELATED ACTIVITY; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; MACAQUE MONKEY; RABIES VIRUS; ALERT CAT; NUCLEUS-PREPOSITUS; OCULOMOTOR SYSTEM; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; RHESUS-MONKEY

The results showed that the superior vestibular nucleus and the medial vestibular nucleus, especially its rostral-to-middle parts, project to the lateral part of the parafascicular thalamic nucleus (corresponding to the centromedian nucleus in primates), the transitional zone between the ventrolateral thalamic nucleus (VL) and the ventral posterolateral thalamic nucleus (VPL) (the region considered to be the nucleus ventralis intermedius of Vogt [Vogt C. 1909.

These results suggest that vestibular information is transmitted not only to the cerebral cortex (mainly area 2V and area 3a) but also to the striatum. They also suggest that vestibular activity may affect gaze control by means of vestibulothalamocortical pathway in addition to vestibule-ocular and vestibulopremotoneuronal routes. J. Comp.

However, few studies have investigated the neural sites where multisensory integration may occur. Therefore, we used electrophysiology and retrograde labeling to study a region of the rat parietotemporal cortex that responds uniquely to auditory and somatosensory multisensory stimulation. This multisensory responsiveness suggests a functional organization resembling multisensory association cortex in cats and primates. Extracellular multielectrode surface mapping defined a region between auditory and somatosensory cortex where responses to combined auditory/somatosensory stimulation were larger in amplitude and earlier in latency than responses to either stimulus alone. Moreover, multisensory responses were nonlinear and differed from the summed unimodal responses. Intracellular recording found almost exclusively multisensory cells that responded to both unisensory and multisensory stimulation with excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) and/or action potentials, conclusively defining a multisensory zone (MZ). In addition, intracellular responses were similar to extracellular recordings, with larger and earlier EPSPs evoked by multisensory stimulation, and interactions suggesting nonlinear postsynaptic summation to combined stimuli. Thalamic input to MZ from unimodal auditory and somatosensory thalamic relay nuclei and from multisensory thalamic regions support the idea that parallel thalamocortical projections may drive multisensory functions as strongly as corticocortical projections. Whereas the MZ integrates uni- and multisensory thalamocortical afferent streams, it may ultimately influence brainstem multisensory structures such as the superior colliculus. J. Comp.

V2 contains three sets of stripelike subregions that are marked by differential staining for CO, and which have different corticocortical connections. The pulvinar provides the major subcortical input to V2, and this input is known to be patchy. We were interested to determine how the pattern of pulvinar afferents relates to the layout of the three stripelike compartments that characterize V2. We made large injections of WGA-HRP into the pulvinar (labelling both the inferior and lateral divisions) and mapped the resulting orthograde terminal and retrograde cell label within V2. We observed pulvinar terminal label mainly in lower layer 3 (at the layer 4 border), with light label in layer 1 as well; terminal label in layers 3-4 was distributed in discrete patches with faint bridges of light label between. Comparison with adjacent sections stained for CO or Cat-301 showed that pulvinar terminal zones aligned precisely with regions of increased CO staining, and targeted both ''thick'' (Cat-301(+)) and ''thin'' GO-rich stripes, avoiding the pale stripes (which aligned with the faint bridges of terminal label). Retrogradely labelled cells were found in layers 5A and 6, but the bulk of the feedback to pulvinar arose from layer 6 rather than layer 5 (unlike V1, where feedback to pulvinar arises primarily from layer 5B). These results show that the increased CO staining in certain subregions of V2 is closely correlated with the presence of thalamic terminals from the pulvinar. Although we cannot rule out the possibility that different sets of pulvinar neurons project to different CO compartments in V2, the presence of a prominent thalamic input shared by the ''thick'' and ''thin'' CO stripes (which receive different V1 afferents and make different feedforward projections to other visual cortical areas) could underlie the preferential intrinsic interconnections shown to exist between these V2 subregions and suggests another potential source of integration between the two cortical visual streams.",PRIMATE; THALAMUS; VISUAL CORTEX; NEUROANATOMY; EXTRASTRIATE; MONKEY; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; RECEPTIVE-FIELD PROPERTIES; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; RHESUS-MONKEY; LAMINAR DISTRIBUTION; INFERIOR PARIETAL; CORTEX; ORGANIZATION; PATHWAYS; SEGREGATION

Here we used retrograde transneuronal transport of rabies virus to identify neurons in the cerebellar nuclei that project via the thalamus to area 46 of the prefrontal cortex of macaques in comparison with the projections to the primary motor cortex (M1). After rabies injections into area 46, many neurons in the restricted region of the posterior interpositus nucleus (PIN) were labeled disynaptically via the thalamus, whereas no neuron labeling was found in the anterior interpositus nucleus (AIN). The distribution of the labeled neurons was dorsoventrally different from that of PIN neurons labeled from the M1. This defines an anatomical substrate for the contribution of medial cerebellar output to cognitive functions. Like the dentate nucleus, the PIN has dual motor and cognitive channels, whereas the AIN has a motor channel only.",acquisition; retention; cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathway; CONDITIONED EYELID RESPONSES; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; LESIONS; MONKEY; RABIES; PROJECTIONS; MEMORY; MOTOR; ORGANIZATION; ACQUISITION

Anterograde labeling of terminals was done with 2% WGA-HRP injections in the cervical enlargement; thalamocortical cells were retrogradely labeled with fluorescent tracers. In one experiment, the contralateral;primary somatosensory cortex hand region (hSI) was injected to provide a direct comparison with hSII thalamic label. Both labeled cells and terminal-like structures were visualized in single thalamic sections and their numbers and positions quantitatively analyzed. The number of labeled cells within 100 microns from the STT terminals were counted as overlapping cells. Four thalamic nuclei, ventroposterior inferior (VPI), ventroposterior lateral (VPI), posterior nucleus (PO) and centrolateral nucleus (CL) combined to contain 86.5% of all hSII-projecting overlapping cells. Of all hSII-projecting thalamic overlapping cells, VPI contained the largest number (36.4% of the total)followed by the anterior portion of the posterior nuclear complex (POa; 20.4%), VPL (18.3%) and CL (11.4%). Results of the hSI injection show a different pattern of overlap in agreement with our earlier study. The relative distribution of overlapping cells was dependent on the antero-posterior position of the SII injections. The most anterior injections resulted in small numbers of labeled cells, with the majority of overlapping cells located in PO and CL. The more posterior injections resulted in overlapping cells mainly in VPI and VPL. The results indicate that, in the squirrel monkey, VPI, VPL, POa and CL relay nociceptive information from the spinal cord to the second somatosensory cortex.",THALAMOCORTICAL; SPINAL CORD; ASCENDING PROJECTION; NOCICEPTIVE; PAIN; NOXIOUS THERMAL-STIMULATION; CORTICAL AREA; CORTICOCORTICAL CONNECTIONS; NOCICEPTIVE RESPONSES; MACAQUE MONKEYS; PRIMATE; NEURONS; 2ND; PATHWAYS; CELLS

In addition to the relatively well described age-associated pathologies that reduce sensory processing at the level of the cochlea and eye, multiple changes occur along the ascending auditory and visual pathways that further reduce sensory function in each domain. One fundamental question that remains to be directly addressed is whether the structure and function of the central auditory and visual systems follow similar trajectories across the lifespan or sustain the impacts of brain aging independently. The present study used diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and electrophysiological assessments of auditory and visual system function in adult and aged macaques to better understand how age-related changes in white matter connectivity at multiple levels of each sensory system might impact auditory and visual function. In particular, the fractional anisotropy (FA) of auditory and visual system thalamocortical and interhemispheric corticocortical connections was estimated using probabilistic tractography analyses. Sensory processing and sensory system FA were both reduced in older animals compared with younger adults. Corticocortical FA was significantly reduced only in white matter of the auditory system of aged monkeys, while thalamocortical FA was lower only in visual system white matter of the same animals. Importantly, these structural alterations were significantly associated with sensory function within each domain. Together, these results indicate that age-associated deficits in auditory and visual processing emerge in part from microstructural alterations to specific sensory white matter tracts, and not from general differences in white matter condition across the aging brain.",auditory brainstem response; diffusion MRI; sensory deficits; splenium; thalamic radiation; visual evoked potential; AGE-RELATED DIFFERENCES; STEM RESPONSE LATENCY; OLDER-ADULTS; HEARING-LOSS; RISK-FACTORS; CORTEX; IMPAIRMENT; PATHWAY; CONNECTIONS; VOLUME

Projection neurons were mostly medium-sized, with oval-fusiform or polygonal perikarya, few primary dendrites, and frequent somatic spines; local circuit neurons were smaller. Four basic types of synaptic boutons were distinguished: (1) Small- to medium-sized boutons containing round vesicles (SR) and forming asymmetric contacts, identified as corticothalamic terminals. (2) Heterogeneous medium-sized boutons with asymmetric contacts and round vesicles, similar to the so-called large round (LR) boutons, which were in part of cortical origin. (3) Heterogeneous CAD-positive small- to medium-sized boutons, containing pleomorphic vesicles and forming symmetric contacts (F1 type), which included pallidothalamic terminals. (4) Presynaptic profiles represented by CAD-positive vesicle-containing dendrites of local circuit neurons. Complex synaptic arrangements, serial synapses and triads with LR and SR boutons engaging all parts of projection neuron dendrites and somata, were seen consistently, whereas classical glomeruli were infrequent. LR and SR boutons also established synapses on dendrites of local circuit neurons. Fl boutons established synapses on projection neuron somata, dendrites and initial axon segments. Compared to other previously studied motor-related thalamic nuclei, differences in synaptic coverage between proximal and distal projection neuron dendrites were less pronounced, and the density of synapses formed by local circuit dendrites on projection neuron dendrites was lower. Thus, compared to other thalamic nuclei, the overlap of different inputs was higher on monkey centromedian cells, and centromedian inhibitory circuits displayed a different organization.",nan; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; GLUTAMIC-ACID DECARBOXYLASE; VENTRALIS ANTERIOR THALAMI; MACACA-MULATTA THALAMUS; TMB REACTION-PRODUCT; CELL-TYPES; SUBCORTICAL PROJECTIONS; PARAFASCICULAR COMPLEX; PRESYNAPTIC DENDRITES; EFFERENT PROJECTIONS

In neurodegenerative disorders termed tauopathies, like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease, tau becomes hyperphosphorylated and forms intracellular inclusions. Rhesus macaques are widely used for studying ageing processes and modeling neurodegenerative disorders, yet little is known about endogenous tau expression in their brains. In this study, immunohistochemical methods were used to map and characterize total tau, 3R- and 4R-tau isoforms, and phosphorylated tau (pThr231-tau and pSer202/Thr205-tau/AT8) expression bilaterally in 16 brain regions of normal and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced hemiparkinsonian adult rhesus macaques. Tau-immunoreactivity (-ir), including both 3R and 4R isoforms, was observed throughout the brain, with varying regional intensities. The anterior cingulate cortex, entorhinal cortex, and hippocampus displayed the most robust tau-ir, while the subthalamic nucleus and white matter regions had minimal expression. Tau was present in neurons of gray matter regions; it was preferentially observed in fibers of the globus pallidus and substantia nigra and in cell bodies of the thalamus and subthalamic nucleus. In white matter regions, tau was abundantly present in oligodendrocytes. Additionally, neuronal pThr231-tau-ir was abundant in all brain regions, but not AT8-ir. Differences in regional and intracellular protein expression were not detected between control subjects and both brain hemispheres of MPTP-treated animals. Specifically, tau-ir in the substantia nigra of all subjects colocalized with GABAergic neurons. Overall, this report provides an in-depth characterization of tau expression in the rhesus macaque brain to facilitate future investigations for understanding and modeling tau pathology in this species.",hippocampus; macaque; MPTP; phosphorylated tau; substantia nigra; tau; white matter; NONHUMAN PRIMATE MODELS; ALPHA-SYNUCLEIN; SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; PROTEIN-TAU; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; PROCESS OUTGROWTH; PATHOLOGY; LOCALIZATION; DEGENERATION

The model clarifies how bottom-up and top-down processes work together to realize this goal, notably how processes of learning, expectation, attention, resonance, and synchrony are coordinated. The model hereby clarifies, for the first time, how the following levels of brain organization coexist to realize cognitive processing properties that regulate fast learning and stable memory of brain representations: single-cell properties, such as spiking dynamics, spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP), and acetylcholine modulation; detailed laminar thalamic and cortical circuit designs and their interactions; aggregate cell recordings, such as current source densities and local field potentials; and single-cell and large-scale inter-areal oscillations in the gamma and beta frequency domains. In particular, the model predicts how laminar circuits of multiple cortical areas interact with primary and higher-order specific thalamic nuclei and nonspecific thalamic nuclei to carry out attentive visual learning and information processing. The model simulates how synchronization of neuronal spiking occurs within and across brain regions, and triggers STDP. Matches between bottom-up adaptively filtered input patterns and learned top-down expectations cause gamma oscillations that support attention, resonance, learning, and consciousness. Mismatches inhibit learning while causing beta oscillations during reset and hypothesis testing operations that are initiated in the deeper cortical layers. The generality of learned recognition codes is controlled by a vigilance process mediated by acetylcholine. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Previous studies showed that corticothalamic input is essential for the development of thalamocortical projections, but less is known about the potential role of this reciprocal connection in the development of retinal projections. Here, we show a deficit of retinal innervation in the dLGN around E18.5 in Tra2 beta conditional knockout (cKO) cortexless mice, an age when apoptosis occurs along the thalamocortical tract and in some dLGN neurons. In vivo electrophysiology experiments in the dLGN further confirmed the loss of functional retinal input. Experiments with N-methyl-d-aspartic acid-induced V1 lesion as well as Fezf2 cKO mice confirmed that the disruption of connections between the dLGN and V1 lead to abnormal retinal projections to the dLGN. Interestingly, retinal projections to the ventral Lateral Geniculate Nucleus (vLGN) and Superior Colliculus (SC) were normal in all 3 mice models. Finally, we show that the cortexless mice had worse performance than control mice in a go-no go task with visual cues.

Only 5-10% of the inputs to geniculate relay cells derive from retina, which is the driving input. The rest, being modulatory, derive from local inhibitory inputs, descending inputs from visual cortex, and ascending inputs from brainstem. The nonretinal, modulatory inputs, which form the vast majority, dynamically control the nature of the geniculate relay. Among other actions, these modulatory inputs regulate membrane properties of relay cells and thereby control their mode of response to retinal inputs, and this dramatically affects the nature of information relayed to cortex. Our studies of the lateral geniculate nucleus of the cat lead to the speculation that this dynamic control depends on the animal's behavioral state and represents the neuronal substrate for many forms of visual attention. The lateral geniculate nucleus is a first-order relay, because it relays subcortical (i.e. retinal) information to cortex for the first time. In contrast, the other main thalamic relay of visual information, the pulvinar (and lateral posterior nucleus in carnivores), is largely a higher-order relay, since much of it seems to relay information from one cortical area to another. Much more corticocortical processing may involve these 're-entry' routes than has been hitherto appreciated.

This study examined the possibility that the TRN is involved in covert orienting of attention. Attention can be summoned to a spatial location in the absence of an overt orienting response. The reaction time to a visual target is faster when attention has been drawn to the location of the target by a preceding cue in that location (valid cue) compared with when the cue misdirects attention (invalid cue) away from the location of the subsequent target. This reaction time difference is referred to as the validity effect. Rats were trained to perform such a reaction time task with visual cues and targets presented in poke holes to either side of the rat's head, which had to be maintained centrally and still. If the rat made an overt orienting response to the cue, the trial was aborted. Unilateral lesions were made by injection of ibotenic acid in the TRN. After surgery, there was no bias apparent in their responding; they were as likely to initiate responses and were equally accurate to either side. There was, however, a complete abolition of the validity effect for responses to contralateral targets.

Developing therapeutic interventions for CPSP is difficult because its pathophysiology is unclear. In recent years, rodent models of CPSP have been developed to address this problem. In these models, a lesion of the thalamus including the ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPL) was made by inducing a focal stroke. Using these models, cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie pathogenesis of CPSP have been discovered. Moreover, some drugs have been suggested to ameliorate the symptoms of the rodent CPSP models. In addition to the rodent models, a primate model of CPSP might also contribute to overcoming CPSP because it is more compatible with humans in regard to the structures and functions of brain regions which is suggested to be involved in pain in humans. Aside from humans, the macaque monkeys are the most widespread primate genus, ranging from Japan to North Africa. Since the macaque monkeys are the animal species closest to humans among those which can be used for invasive experiments, they are widely used to understand the mechanisms of the human brain. Therefore, we developed a nonhuman primate model of CPSP using macaque monkeys. Because there were individual differences among macaque monkeys, the location of the VPL in each monkey was determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and extracellular recording of neuronal activity during tactile stimulation. Thereafter, a hemorrhagic lesion was induced by injecting collagenase type IV. Histological analysis using Nissl staining revealed that most of the lesion was localized within the VPL. Several weeks after the injection, the macaques displayed behavioral changes that were interpreted as reflecting the development of both mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. In rodent models, the onsets of mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia occur within 1 week after the induction of hemorrhage due to the injection of collagenase around the VPL. The macaque model more faithfully reproduced the symptoms of patients suffering from CPSP, in which both mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia often develop several weeks after cerebrovascular accident. Therefore, the model may be suitable for testing therapeutic interventions that last for several months, such as continuous pharmacological treatment and rehabilitative training. Currently, brain imaging using functional magnetic resonance imaging is performed to detect brain activity changes underlying CPSP using the established macaque model. The combination of the homology of pain-related cortical areas between macaques and humans with relatively large macaque brain enables acquisition of imaging data on par with those examined in clinical research. Therefore, the brain imaging studies using the macaque monkey provide an advantage for the translation of the findings to human patients. We believe that animal models of CPSP will contribute not only to full understanding of pathophysiology but also to the development of therapeutic interventions for it.",Animal model; Brain imaging; Plasticity; Thalamus; Ventral posterolateral nucleus; nan

None of the doses (3, 10, and 30 mg/kg i.v.) of R-THBP used significantly affected the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF as determined by Raichle's (H2O)-O-15 method), and 10 mg/kg of R-THBP had little effect on the regional cerebral metabolic rate of glucose (rCMRglc) in the Rhesus monkey brain, as assessed by the graphical [F-18]fluoro-deoxyglucose method. The effect of R-THBP on the muscarinic cholinergic system was dose dependent; while 3 mg/kg of R-THBP did not significantly alter the uptake ratio of N-[C-11]methyl-benztropine in several brain regions to that in the cerebellum, 10 and 30 mg/kg of R-THBP significantly reduced the uptake ratio in the thalamus, as well as in the frontal and temporal cortices. None of the doses (3, 10, and 30 mg/kg i.v.) of R-THBP tested affected [C-11]SCH23390 (dopamine D-1 receptor) binding. However, the k3 value for N-[C-11]methyl-spiperone (dopamine D-2 receptor) binding, which represents the association rate x B-max value, was significantly decreased in the striatum. The uptake ratio of (+)[C-11]UH232 (dopamine D-3 receptor) in the striatum to that in the cerebellum was also decreased by administration of R-THBP (3 and 30 mg/kg i.v.). These findings suggest that R-THBP acts on dopamine D-2 and D-3 receptors selectively without markedly affecting dopamine D-1 receptor binding. Furthermore, the changes in cholinergic and dopamine D-2 and D-3 receptors in vivo can not be attributed to a change in rCBF but may depend on the action of R-THBP.","tetrahydrobiopterin; muscarinic cholinergic receptor; dopamine D-1, D-2, D-3 receptors; positron emission tomography; monkey brain; HUMAN-BRAIN; RAT-BRAIN; ACETYLCHOLINE-RELEASE; SEROTONIN RECEPTORS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; PASSIVE-AVOIDANCE; INVITRO BINDING; TETRAHYDROBIOPTERIN; PET; ENHANCEMENT"

We have begun studies of the monkey visual system to investigate the location and nature of these changes as well as to answer general questions about the effects of aging on neural structure and function. We began with the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) because it is the main structure through which visual information passes on the way to cortex and because the parallel parvicellular and magnocellular pathways are most easily identified and studied in the LGN. In the present experiment, we determined the sizes, densities, and numbers of LGN neurons in young-adult (5 to 12.5 years) and old (23 to 27.5 years) rhesus monkeys. The measures were corrected for tissue shrinkage, and stereological procedures were used that yield unbiased estimates. In young-adult monkeys, neuron densities were lower in the magnocellular layers (about 14,000/mm3) than in the parvicellular layers (23,000/mm3). Neuron density increased about 28% from anterior to posterior in both types of layers. There was an average of approximately 1,267,000 neurons in the parvicellular layers and 148,000 neurons in the magnocellular layers; however, there was substantial variability (1.9-fold) among five brains studied. Aging produced a statistically significant decrease in neuron density in both the magnocellular (29% average decrease) and parvicellular (41% average decrease) layers. However, there was no significant loss of neurons. Rather, the density decrease was due to a small (nonsignificant) decrease in the number of neurons combined with a small (nonsignificant) increase in LGN volume. The increase in LGN volume was due to a significant increase in neuron soma-size and proportional increases in the volume of glial cells, blood vessels, and neuropil. These results, together with those of other studies, suggest that the effects of aging on the primate visual pathway from retina through striate cortex are relatively subtle. It is possible that the major neural changes occur more centrally. Alternatively, individual differences in the effects of aging may require much larger samples or prior screening to observe consistent changes.

Studies already demonstrated that the pharmacological disinhibition of the sensorimotor, associative, and limbic GPe produced dyskinesia, hyperactivity, and compulsive behaviors, respectively. The aim of this study was to investigate the cortical regions altered by the disinhibition of each GPe functional territory. Thus, 5 macaques were injected with bicuculline in sensorimotor, associative, and limbic sites of the GPe producing dyskinesia, hyperactivity, and compulsive behaviors, and underwent in vivo positron tomography with F-18-2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose to identify cortical dysfunctions related to GPe disinhibition. Blood cortisol levels were also quantified as a biomarker of anxiety for each condition. Our results showed that pallidal bicuculline injections in anesthetized animals reproducibly modified the activity of specific ipsilateral and contralateral cortical areas depending on the pallidal territory targeted. Bicuculline injections in the limbic GPe led to increased ipsilateral activations in limbic cortical regions (anterior insula, amygdala, and hippocampus). Injections in the associative vs. sensorimotor GPe increased the activity in the ipsilateral midcingulate vs. somatosensory and parietal cortices. Moreover, bicuculline injections increased blood cortisol levels only in animals injected in their limbic GPe. These are the first functional results supporting the model of opened cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loops where modifications in a functional pallidal territory can impact cortical activities of the same functional territory but also cortical activities of other functional territories. This highlights the importance of the GPe as a crucial node in the top-down control of the cortico-striato-thalamocortical circuits from the frontal cortex to influence the perception, attention, and emotional processes at downstream (or non-frontal) cortical levels. Finally, we showed the implication of the ventral pallidum with the amygdala and the insular cortex in a circuit related to aversive processing that should be crucial for the production of anxious disorders.",External globus pallidus; Cortex; PET imaging; Opened cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loops; Aversive processing; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; MONKEY GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; OLD-WORLD MONKEY; BASAL GANGLIA; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; HUNTINGTONS-DISEASE; FUNCTIONAL-ANATOMY; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; PROJECTION NEURONS; MOTOR CONTROL

We employed a triple-labeling technique in the same owl monkey (Aotus trivirgatus). The cerebellothalamic projections were labeled with injections of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, and the pallidothalamic projections were labeled with biotinylated dextran amine. The pre-SMA was identified by location and movement patterns evoked by intracortical microstimulation and injected with the retrograde tracer cholera toxin subunit B. Brain sections were processed sequentially using different chromogens to visualize all three tracers in the same section. Alternate sections were processed for Nissl cytoarchitecture or acetylcholinesterase chemoarchitecture for nuclear boundaries. The cerebellar nuclei primarily projected to posterior (VLp), medial (VLx), and dorsal (VLd) divisions of the ventral lateral nucleus; the pallidum largely projected to the anterior division (VLa) of the ventral lateral nucleus and the parvocellular part of the ventral anterior nucleus (VApc). However, we also found zones of overlapping projections, as well as interdigitating foci of pallidal and cerebellar label, particularly in border regions of the VLa and VApc. Thalamic neurons labeled by pre-SMA injections occupied a wide band and were especially concentrated in the VLx and VApc, cerebellar and pallidal territories, respectively. Labeled thalamocortical neurons overlapped cerebellar inputs in the VLd and VApc and overlapped pallidal inputs in the VLa and the ventral medial nucleus. The results demonstrate that inputs from both the cerebellum and globus pallidus are relayed to the pre-SMA. J. Comp. Neurol. 417:164-180, 2000.

Focal iontophoretic injections of the anterograde tracer, biocytin, were made into the vMGB of neonatal rabbits to examine the morphological organization of auditory thalamocortical (TC) afferents prior to hearing onset. TC afferents terminated in distinct patches as early as postnatal day 1 (PD-0 = day of birth), 6 days before the behavioral onset of hearing. In contrast to TC afferents in adults, the terminal arbors of neonatal vMGB axons occupied the entire depth of the cortical plate and lamina I. Serial section reconstructions revealed that single vMGB axons in neonates branched to form multiple patches within the cortical plate. Collaterals also extended to lamina I where they coursed tangentially for several millimeters. An unusual feature of the neonatal TC patches was the contribution of descending collaterals from axons coursing in lamina I. The presence of distinct patches prior to hearing onset indicates that the segregation of auditory TC axons occurs in the absence of acoustically driven activity.

Viral antigen was found in all cell layers of the cerebellum, the gray matter of the thalamus and brainstem, and the ventral horn of all levels of the spinal cord. Staining was limited to neurons and their processes. Histopathologic changes were limited to the nervous system and characterized by nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis.

In order to understand the potential for acetylcholine to play a role in visual attention, we studied nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) localization and function in area V1 of the macaque. We found nAChRs presynaptically at thalamic synapses onto excitatory, but not inhibitory, neurons in the primary thalamorecipient layer 4c. Furthermore, consistent with the release enhancement suggested by this localization, we discovered that nicotine increases responsiveness and lowers contrast threshold in layer 4c neurons. We also found that nAChRs are expressed by GABAergic interneurons; in V1 but rarely by pyramidal neurons, and that nicotine suppresses visual responses outside layer 4c. All sensory systems incorporate gain control mechanisms, or processes which dynamically alter input/output relationships. We demonstrate that at the site of thalamic input to visual cortex, the effect of this nAChR-mediated gain is an enhancement of the detection of visual stimuli.",nan; CAT VISUAL-CORTEX; CONTRAST RESPONSE FUNCTIONS; MONKEY STRIATE CORTEX; ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; CHOLINERGIC MODULATION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; MACACA-FASCICULARIS; GABAERGIC NEURONS; CORTICAL-NEURONS

The dopamine hypothesis of schizophrenia has, however, not been thoroughly examined in terms of this complex structure, which has connections with most brain regions of central interest in schizophrenia research. The aim of the present study was to examine dopamine D-2 receptor binding in subregions of the thalamus in patients with schizophrenia. Method: The authors used positron emission tomography and the radioligand [C-11]FLB457 to examine dopamine D-2 receptor binding in thalamic subregions of 10 drug-naive patients with schizophrenia. Binding potential was calculated by the reference tissue method and used as an index for dopamine D-2 receptor binding. Comparisons were made with 19 healthy subjects. Subregions of interest were de-fined on individual magnetic resonance images using a percentage-based operational approach. Clinical symptoms were rated by using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Results: The [C-11]FLB457 binding potential was lower in the central medial and posterior subregions of the thalamus in patients with schizophrenia. At a functional level, there was a significant negative correlation between binding potential and BPRS positive symptom scores. Conclusions: The subregions with low D-2 receptor binding comprise primarily the dorsomedial nucleus and pulvinar, two important components in circuitries previously suggested in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Aberrant dopaminergic neurotransmission in thalamic subregions might be a mechanism underlying positive symptoms in schizophrenia.",nan; POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; HUMAN BRAIN; CINGULATE CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; TREATED PATIENTS; PET; ABNORMALITIES; MEDIODORSAL

In situ hybridization histochemistry revealed that SPP1 mRNA was expressed specifically in pyramidal neurons in layer V of the sensorimotor cortex of the rhesus macaque. These SPP1 mRNA-positive neurons were most abundant in the primary motor area, followed by Brodmann area 5 and the supplementary motor area, in accordance with the distribution of corticospinal neurons. In addition, injection of a retrograde neuroanatomical tracer into the lateral corticospinal tract (CST) of the spinal cord caused labeling of SPP1 positive neurons, indicating the expression of SPP1 in corticospinal neurons. SPP1 was also expressed in the thalamus, brainstem, and spinal ventral horn of the rhesus macaque. Although SPP1 was also detected in the brainstem and spinal cord of the marmoset and the rat, it was not detected in their cerebral cortices. Selective expression in the corticospinal neurons of the sensorimotor cortex of the rhesus macaque suggests that SPP1 plays a critical role in the functional or structural specialization of highly developed corticospinal systems in certain primate species.

They are termed caudal and rostral forelimb areas (CFA and RFA). In this study, it was confirmed first that RFA and CFA are located in cytoarchitectonically distinct areas (medial and lateral parts of agranular cortex (AGm and AGI), respectively). In the second part of this study, the distribution of thalamic and cortical neurons projecting to RFA and CFA was quantitatively compared by injections of small and relatively constant amounts of retrograde fluorescent dyes (diamidino yellow and fast blue) into these areas. It was observed that (1) main inputs to RFA originated from AGI, namely CFA (2) CFA received dominant inputs from AGm including RFA and caudally adjacent granular cortex and (3) wider cortical areas and larger number of neurons projected to CFA than to RFA. As for the thalamocortical projections, both RFA and CFA received inputs from various thalamic nuclei, such as VL, VM, Po, PC, PF, CL, but cells projecting to RFA and CFA were differentially located in each nucleus. It was found that labeled cell number and/or density in VM, PC, CL, CM and MD after RFA injections were significantly larger than those after CFA injections. On the other hand, labeled cell number and/or density in VPL and VL were significantly higher after CFA injections than after RFA injections. In comparison with findings in primates, the results suggest that the cortical motor areas of rats may be specialized for different aspects of motor control.

It has been dogma in sensory systems that the thalamic feedforward input is relatively weak and that there is a large amplification of the input signal by recurrent feedback. Here we show that in trichromatic primates there is a major feedforward input to layer 4C of primary visual cortex. Using a combination of 3D-electron-microscopy and 3D-confocal imaging of thalamic boutons we found that the average feedforward contribution was about 20% of the total excitatory input in the parvocellular (P) pathway, about 3 times the currently accepted values for primates. In the magnocellular (M) pathway it was around 15%, nearly twice the currently accepted values. New methods showed the total synaptic and cell densities were as much as 150% of currently accepted values. The new estimates of contributions of feedforward synaptic inputs into visual cortex call for a major revision of the design of the canonical cortical circuit.",cortical layers; NeuN; thalamic afferents; V1; VGluT2; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; VESICULAR GLUTAMATE TRANSPORTERS; SPINY STELLATE NEURONS; MACAQUE STRIATE CORTEX; ORIENTATION SELECTIVITY; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; SIMPLE CELLS; OLD-WORLD; AREA 17; FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE

To study the development of these connections in humans, regions of fixed brain from fetuses of 20-22 gestational weeks (GW) were injected with the fluorescent tracer DiI. Placement of DiI in the optic nerve or tract labeled retinogeniculate projections. In the LGN, these projections were already segregated into eye-specific layers by 20 GW. Retinogeniculate segregation thus preceded cellular lamination of the LGN, which did not commence until 22 GW. Thalamocortical axons, labeled from DiI injections into the optic radiations, densely innervated the subplate, but did not significantly innervate the cortical plate. This pattern was consistent with observations of a waiting period in animals, when thalamocortical axons synapse in the subplate for days or weeks before entering the cortical plate. Cortical efferent neurons (labeled retrogradely from the optic radiations) were located in the subplate and deep layers of the cortical plate. In summary, human visual connections are partially formed by mid-gestation, and undergo further refinement during and after this period.

Because MD is reciprocally interconnected with prefrontal and agranular insular cortical areas, it provides a relay of ventral forebrain activity to these cortical areas. However, there are also direct projections from the piriform cortex and the amygdala to the prefrontal and agranular insular cortices. This study addresses whether this system has a triangular organization, such that structures in the ventral forebrain project to interconnected areas in MD and the prefrontal/insular cortex. The thalamocortical projections of MD have been studied in experiments with injections of retrograde tracers into prefrontal or agranular insular cortical areas. In many of the same experiments, projections from the ventral forebrain to MD and to the prefrontal/insular cortex have been demonstrated with anterograde axonal tracers. The connections of the piriform cortex (PC) with MD and the prefrontal/insular cortex form an organized triangular system. The PC projections to the central and medial segments of MD and to the lateral orbital cortex (LO) and the ventral and posterior agranular insular cortices (AI(v) and AI(p)) are topographically organized, such that more caudal parts of PC tend to project more medially in MD and more caudally within the orbital/insular cortex. The central and medial portions of MD also send matching, topographically organized projections to LO, AI(v) and AI(p), with more medial parts of MD projecting further caudally. The anterior cortical nucleus of the amygdala (CO(a)) also projects to the dorsal part of the medial segment of MD and to its cortical targets, the medial orbital area (MO) and AI(p). The projections of the basal/accessory basal amygdaloid nuclei to MD and to prefrontal cortex, and from MD to amygdaloceptive parts of prefrontal cortex, are not as tightly organized. Amygdalothalamic afferents in MD are concentrated in the dorsal half of the medial segment. Cells in this part of the nucleus project to the amygdaloceptive prelimbic area (PL) and AI(p). However, other amygdaloceptive prefrontal areas are connected to parts of MD that do not receive fibers from the amygdala.

Fibers from other parts of the pallidum, or related areas such as the substantia nigra, pars reticulata, terminate in the lateral and ventral parts of MD, where they overlap with inputs from the superior colliculus and other brainstem structures.

A model of unilateral peripheral neuropathy was developed in the cynomolgus macaque, a species that is phylogenetically close to humans. Nerve entrapment was induced by placing a 4 mm length of polyvinyl cuff around the left common sciatic nerve. Prior to nerve injury, stimulation of the foot with a range of non-noxious von Frey filaments (1, 4, 8, 15, and 26 g) did not evoke brain activation as observed with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Two weeks after injury, stimulation of the ipsilateral foot with non-noxious filaments activated the contralateral insula/secondary somatosensory cortex (Ins/SII) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). By contrast, no activation was observed with stimulation of the contralateral foot. Robust bilateral activation of thalamus was observed three to five weeks after nerve injury. Treatment with the clinical analgesic pregabalin reduced evoked activation of Ins/SII, thalamus and ACC whereas treatment with the NK1 receptor antagonist aprepitant reduced activation of the ipsilateral (left) thalamus. Twelve to 13 weeks after nerve injury, treatment with pregabalin reduced evoked activation of all regions of interest (ROI). By contrast, brain activation persisted in most ROI, except the ACC, following aprepitant treatment. Activation of the contralateral Ins/SII and bilateral thalamus was observed six months after nerve injury and pregabalin treatment suppressed activation of these nuclei. The current findings demonstrated persistent changes in CNS neurons following nerve injury as suggested by activation with non-painful mechanical stimulation. Furthermore, it was possible to functionally distinguish between a clinically efficacious analgesic drug, pregabalin, from a drug that has not demonstrated significant clinical analgesic efficacy, aprepitant.

Since tactile inputs to an opposable thumb are often spatially and temporally out of sync with inputs from the fingers, we hypothesized that inputs from the opposable thumb would be processed in an independent module in the primary somatosensory cortex (area 3b). Here we show that in area 3b of macaque monkeys, most neurons in the thumb representation do not respond to tactile stimulation of other digits and receive few intrinsic cortical inputs from other digits. However, neurons in the representations of other 4 digits respond to touch on any of the 4 digits and interconnect significantly more. The thumb inputs are thus processed in an independent module, whereas there is a significantly more interdigital information exchange between the other digits. This cortical organization reflects behavioral use of a hand with an opposable thumb.",primate; somatotopy; intrinsic connections; area 3b; Macaca; AREA 3B; SPINAL-CORD; HORIZONTAL CONNECTIONS; THALAMOCORTICAL CONNECTIONS; SOMATOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; VISUAL-CORTEX; SENSORY LOSS; MOTOR AREAS; HAND USE

However, most of these models have been established on lower animals, such as rodents, and involve only a single administration of a noxious stimulus. In this study, an inflammatory soup (10 mu L), consisting of prostaglandin E2 (0.2 mM), serotonin (2 mM), bradykinin (2 mM) and histamine (2 mM), was injected into the dura mater of conscious rhesus monkeys through an indwelling catheter. The in fusion started on day 8 and was repeated every 3 days, for a total of six administrations, to induce neurogenic inflammation. We performed behavioral assessments and measured the expression of the oncogcne c-fos, neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) and calcitonin gene related peptide (CGRP) in the trigeminal system and in multiple brain regions involved in pain processing by immunohistochemical staining. Compared with monkeys in the control group, three of the four animals in the inflammatory soup group displayed decreased motor behaviors, and two showed increased ipsilateral nose and mouth secretions during the stimulus period. Higher expression levels of c-fos, nNOS and CGRP were found in various brain areas of experimental animals compared with controls, including the trigeminal nucleus caudalis, thalamus, hypothalamus, midbrain, pons and other areas involved in pain perception. These results suggest that repeated inflammatory soup stimulation of the dura activates the trigeminovascular system and produces migraine-like pathological changes and abnormal behaviors in conscious rhesus monkeys.",nerve regeneration; migraine; rhesus monkey; neurogenic inflammation; cellular oncogene fos; neuronal nitric oxide synthase; calcitonin gene related peptide; trigeminal system; behavior; irnmunohistochemistry; neural regeneration; GENE-RELATED PEPTIDE; C-FOS; NEUROGENIC INFLAMMATION; HEADACHE; STIMULATION; ACTIVATION; NUCLEUS; PAIN; IMMUNOREACTIVITY; PATHOPHYSIOLOGY

The contours of the thalamus were first drawn on the stained histological slices. The series of histological sections were then aligned and mapped onto the in vivo MRI of the same animal acquired prior to the sacrifice following a methodology described in Dauguet et al. (2007) [1] using the block face photographs as an intermediary modality. By applying the series of transformations previously estimated for the histological volume, the contours of the digital atlas were mapped onto the MRI data. The protocol was tested on two baboon brains for which the full series of slices were available, and a macaque brain for which a subset only of the histological slices were available demonstrating the ability of building digital atlases in the MRI geometry without mounting and staining all the brain slices. We then studied the accuracy of mapping the digital atlas of one baboon onto the MRI of the other baboon by comparing the overlapping with its original digital atlas. We finally used the digital atlas of one of the baboons to study the individual kinetic of the main thalamus nuclei on Positron Emission Tomography (PET) images providing a novel and accurate way of measuring very fine and local functional differences.

Numerous algorithms for neuron segmentation have been published, but they are mainly evaluated using limited subsets from a specific anatomical region, targeting neurons of clear contrast and/or neurons with similar staining intensity. It is thus unclear how these algorithms perform on cerebral neurons in diverse anatomical regions. In this article, we introduce and reliably evaluate existing machine learning algorithms using a data set of microscopy images of macaque brain. This data set highlights various anatomical regions (e.g., cortex, caudate, thalamus, claustrum, putamen, hippocampus, subiculum, lateral geniculate, globus pallidus, etc.), poor contrast, and staining intensity differences of neurons. The evaluation was performed using 10 architectures of six classic machine learning algorithms in terms of typical Recall, Precision, F-score, aggregated Jaccard index (AJI), as well as a performance ranking of algorithms. F-score of most of the algorithms is superior to 0.7. Deep learning algorithms facilitate generally higher F-scores. U-net with suitable layer depth has been evaluated to be excellent classifiers with F-score of 0.846 and 0.837 when performing cross validation. The evaluation and analysis indicate the performance gap among algorithms in various anatomical regions and the strengths and limitations of each algorithm. The comparative result highlights at the same time the importance and difficulty of neuron segmentation and provides clues for future improvement. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first comprehensive study for neuron segmentation in such large-scale anatomical regions.",macaque brain; microscopy images; neuron segmentation; segmentation evaluation; U-NET; STEREOLOGICAL ESTIMATION; NUMBERS; ARCHITECTURE; CORTEX; CELLS; SHAPE; SIZE

The nicotinic receptor agonist [C-11]MPA demonstrated rapid uptake into the brain to a similar extent as (S)(-) [C-11]nicotine and [C-11]ABT-418. When unlabeled (S)(-)nicotine (0.02 mg/kg) was administered 5 min before the radioactive tracers, the uptake of [C-11]MPA was decreased by 25% in the thalamus, 19% in the temporal cortex, and 11% in the cerebellum, whereas an increase was found for the uptake of (S)(-)[C-11]nicotine and [C-11]ABT-418.

Striatal neurone degeneration is a hallmark in Huntington's disease and we were interested in estimating total neurone and glial number in this thalamic nuclear complex. Serial 500-mu m-thick gallocyanin-stained frontal sections of the left hemisphere from six cases of Huntington's disease patients (three females, three males) and six age- and sex-matched controls were investigated applying Cavalieri's principle and the optical disector. Mean neurone number in the controls was 646,952 +/- 129,668 cells versus 291,763 +/- 60,122 in Huntington's disease patients (Mann-Whitney U-test, P < 0.001). Total glial cell number (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and unclassifiable glial profiles) was higher in controls with 9,544,191 +/- 3,028,944 versus 6,961,989 +/- 2,241,543 in Huntington's disease patients (Mann-Whitney U-test, P < 0.021). Considerable increase of fibrous astroglia within the centromedian-parafascicular complex could be observed after Gallyas' impregnation. Most probably this cell type enhanced the numerical ratio between glial number and neurone number (glial index: Huntington's disease patients = 24.4 +/- 8.1; controls = 15.0 +/- 5.2; Mann-Whitney U-test, P < 0.013). The neurone number in the centromedian-parafascicular complex correlated negatively, although statistically not significantly, with the striatal neurone number. This lack of correlation between an 80% neuronal loss in the striatum and a 55% neurone loss in the centromedian-parafascicular complex points to viable neuronal circuits connecting the centromedian-parafascicular complex with cortical and subcortical regions that are less affected in Huntington's disease.",Huntington's disease; human brain; thalamus; nuclei centromedianus-parafascicularis; neurone number; FRONTAL EYE FIELD; UNBIASED STEREOLOGICAL ESTIMATION; MACAQUE MONKEY; EFFERENT CONNECTIONS; AFFERENT CONNECTIONS; MACACA-FASCICULARIS; CAUDATE-NUCLEUS; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; PROJECTIONS; CHOREA

Decades of experimental and modeling work in the sensory cortex have demonstrated that a perceptual decision pool is usually composed of tens to hundreds of neurons, the responses of which are significantly correlated not only with each other, but also with the behavioral choices of an animal. Few studies, however, have measured neural activity in the sensory thalamus of awake, behaving animals. Therefore, it remains unclear how many thalamic neurons are recruited and how the information from these neurons is pooled at subsequent cortical stages to form a perceptual decision. In a previous study we measured neural activity in the macaque lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) during a two alternative forced choice (2AFC) contrast detection task, and found that single LGN neurons were significantly correlated with the monkeys' behavioral choices, despite their relatively poor contrast sensitivity and a lack of overall interneuronal correlations. We have now computationally tested a number of specific hypotheses relating these measured LGN neural responses to the contrast detection behavior of the animals. We modeled the perceptual decisions with different numbers of neurons and using a variety of pooling/readout strategies, and found that the most successful model consisted of about 50-200 LGN neurons, with individual neurons weighted differentially according to their signal-to-noise ratios (quantified as d-primes). These results supported the hypothesis that in contrast detection the perceptual decision pool consists of multiple thalamic neurons, and that the response fluctuations in these neurons can influence contrast perception, with the more sensitive thalamic neurons likely to exert a greater influence.",lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN); perception; contrast; neural model; choice probability; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; DECISION-RELATED ACTIVITY; RECEPTIVE-FIELD PROPERTIES; MONKEY AOTUS-TRIVIRGATUS; CHOICE-RELATED ACTIVITY; VISUAL-CORTEX; CORTICAL-NEURONS; AREA MT; PSYCHOPHYSICAL PERFORMANCE; INTERNEURONAL CORRELATIONS

In 23 patients the regional cerebral glucose metabolism (rCMRGlu) was measured with positron emission tomography and the location and spatial extent of the stroke lesions were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging. Motor impairment during the acute and chronic stages (4 weeks after stroke) was determined by a motor score and recordings of magnetic evoked motor potentials. Twelve patients recovered significantly, whereas 11 patients retained a disabling hemiparesis. In contrast to patients with good motor recovery, rCMRGlu was severely depressed in the thalamus on the lesion side in patients with poor motor recovery. This patient group also showed more severe damage to the pyramidal tract on magnetic resonance images and a more pronounced reduction of the magnetic evoked motor potential amplitude. Neither the size of the stroke lesions nor the spatial extent of the lesional and remote rCMRGlu depressions outside the thalamus correlated with the thalamic hypometabolism and the improvement of the motor score. We conclude that preservation both of parts of the pyramidal tract and of the thalamic circuitry is a major determinant for the quality of hand motor recovery following acute brain ischemia in the adult.",nan; MAGNETIC BRAIN-STIMULATION; RHESUS-MONKEY; STRIATOCAPSULAR INFARCTION; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; FRONTAL-LOBE; CORTEX; CONNECTIONS; PULVINAR; LESIONS

The results showed that areas 45A and 45B display reciprocal amygdalar connections, which appear to be considerably richer than those of their neighboring areas. Specifically, these two areas are a target of differentially weighted projections originating predominantly from the magnocellular and the intermediate subdivisions of the basal nucleus and are a source of projections mostly directed to the magnocellular subdivision of the basal nucleus and the dorsal part of the lateral nucleus. The present data, together with previous data on the thalamic connectivity of areas 45A and 45B (Contini et al. Eur J Neurosci 32:1337-53, 2010), suggest that direct and indirect-trans-thalamic-amygdalar connectivity is a characterizing connectional feature of these two areas. Specifically, the amygdalar connections of area 45A, for which a role in communication behavior has been proposed, could convey information on the emotional significance of communicative signals to this area, where it could play a crucial role in guiding appropriate social interactions. Furthermore, the amygdalar connections of area 45B, possibly involved in higher-order aspects of visual guidance of gaze, could convey information related to the relevance of visual stimuli, which could contribute to a representation of priority maps in this VLPF area.",Ventrolateral prefrontal cortex; Communication behavior; Oculomotor behavior; Primates; VENTROLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MONKEY AMYGDALA; TOPOGRAPHIC ORGANIZATION; MACACA-FASCICULARIS; CORTICAL INPUTS; LATERAL NUCLEUS; RHESUS-MONKEY; FRONTAL-LOBE; PROJECTIONS; PATHWAYS

According to the theory conscious mechanisms are associated with behavioural diversity, whereas unconscious output is proposed to have an obligatory association with stereotypical behaviour. The respective processes are by definition a function of the type of reafferent motor input. Concepts of simple and complex premotor networks are introduced as a means of describing unconscious and conscious processes, respectively. Evidence shows that unconscious cognitive performance differs qualitatively from conscious mechanisms suggesting parallel processes. Although the postulated anatomical substrates for conscious and unconscious processes will function in this model as parallel segregated networks, it is proposed they are distributed throughout the same cortical areas of the brain. Motor reafference is postulated to be mediated via pallidal projections to the thalamic reticular nucleus, which is known to modulate thalamocortical pathways. The role of the koniocellular pathway of the lateral geniculate nucleus remains an enigma and has some properties in common with the well-described magnocellular and parvocellular projections. There is also much speculation about the intralaminar and midline nuclei, the so-called non-specific thalamus. The paper will examine the distinctive features of thalamocortical networks and the role of the koniocellular pathway and intralaminar nuclei (ILN) of the thalamus and suggest that they form a neuroanatomical substrate for the categorizing of unconscious cognitive processes. The ILN has unique projections back to the basal ganglia, which could serve in constraining associated neocortical networks with stereotypical behaviour and thus putative unconscious processing. Only after establishing such a theoretical framework can one hope to successfully analyze the empirical literature on the syndrome of blindsight, of which a detailed account is presented. Blindsight refers to the apparent visual abilities of patients with damage to the striate visual cortex (VI). Patients will 'guess' the shape of an object or reach towards it when presented in the blind field, in spite of denying actually seeing it, i.e., they are unconsciously aware of it. Unlike the magnocellular and parvocellular geniculate pathways the koniocellular extrastriate projections partially conserve retinal information in these patients.

Large injections of retrograde tracers involving all layers of the LGN resulted in a distinctive bilaminar distribution of labeled cells in cortical layer 6. One tier of labeled neurons was located along the layer 5-6 border and a second was located near the bottom of the layer, leaving the middle of layer 6 largely free of labeled neurons. Following injections of tracers that were restricted to the magnocellular layers of the LGN, almost all of the labeled neurons were located in the lower tier. In contrast, following injections of retrograde tracers confined to the parvocellular layers of the LGN, labeled cells were found in both tiers, with the greatest number in the upper tier. Thus, layer 6 of macaque striate cortex consists of three distinct sublayers only two of which are the source of descending projections to the LGN: an upper tier that projects exclusively to the parvocellular layers and a lower tier that projects to both magnocellular and parvocellular layers.",VISUAL CORTEX; AREA 17; PARALLEL PATHWAYS; CORTICOTHALAMIC; LATERAL GENICULATE NUCLEUS; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; VISUAL-CORTEX; LAMINAR ORGANIZATION; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; GALAGO-CRASSICAUDATUS; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; AREA 17; PROJECTIONS; CONNECTIONS; AFFERENT

Upon generating a sequence, this model stores information on the serial order of components in a cortical buffer by means of theta-nested gamma frequency oscillations observed experimentally in cortico-striatal neurons. This model assumes the existence of at least two functionally different classes of striatal spiny neurons. One class of striatal projection neurons (S-cells) select the first component in the cortical buffer through a temporal winner-take-all mechanism implemented by lateral inhibition. The inhibition should last for at least a few hundred milliseconds. In reality, it may be mediated by GABAB receptors at the presynaptic terminals of the cortico-striatal projection. The other class of striatal projection neurons (M-cells) retain the currently executed component in a cortico-BG-thalamic loop, for which the strong nonlinearity in transitions between up and down states of striatal neurons is crucial. For sequence generation at the level of striatum, the cortical neurons encoding the component selected for execution are inactivated by the feedback from the activated cortico-BG-thalamic loop. This model predicts that the transition to next component is triggered by a single external signal, i.e. the subthalamic input to the globus pallidum. This input gives a neural substrate for adjusting the rate of sequence generation. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

It receives input from both the basal ganglia and cerebellum, and forms reciprocal connections with motor cortical areas. The current study examined the activity in cat VL thalamus neurons during instrumentally conditioned vocalization. Units in our sample showed irregular spontaneous firing which could be modulated by slowly occurring fluctuations in intensity of vocalization task performance. Two main types of behavioral events were associated with changes in neural firing rate. The first of these was the ingestion of food reward. More than half of all recordings showed phasic bursting patterns during licking; a similar number had increases in firing preparatory to this phasic activity. The second behavioral event modulating unit responses was vocalization. Approximately 60% of recordings showed activity changes time-locked to vocalization. These responses were almost always excitatory, and often involved changes in firing that preceded vocalization onset. No spatial organization of differences in firing pattern between neurons could be distinguished. Our results suggest that VL thalamus may well be involved in mediating vocal behavior, although its functional role remains an object of speculation.

We have now studied thalamic neuronal activity in a cerebellar relay nucleus (ventral intermediate-Vim) and a pallidal relay nucleus (ventralis oral posterior-Vop) during thalamotomy in patients with intention tremor and other clinical signs of cerebellar disease (tremor patients). The activity of single neurons and the simultaneous electromyographic (EMG) activity of the contralateral upper extremity in tremor patients performing a pointing task were analyzed by spectral cross-correlation analysis. EMG spectra during intention tremor often showed peaks of activity in the tremor-frequency range (1.9-5.8 Hz). There were significant differences in thalamic neuronal activity between tremor patients and controls. Neurons in Vim and Vop had significantly lower firing rates in tremor patients than in patients undergoing thalamic surgery for pain (pain controls). Other studies have shown that inputs to Vim from the cerebellum are transmitted through excitatory connections. Therefore the present results suggest that tremor in these tremor patients is associated with deafferentation of the thalamus from cerebellar efferent pathways. The thalamic X EMG cross-correlation functions were studied for cells located in Vim and Vop. Neuronal and EMG activity were as likely to be significantly correlated for cells in Vim as for those in Vop. Cells in Vim were more likely to have a phase lag relative to EMG than were cells in Vop. In monkeys, cells in the cerebellar relay nucleus of the thalamus, corresponding to Vim, are reported to lead movement during active oscillations at the wrist. In view of these monkey studies, the present results suggest that cells in Vim are deafferented and have a phase lag relative to tremor that is not found in normal active oscillations. The difference in phase of thalamic spike X EMG activity between Vim and Vop may contribute to tremor because lesions of pallidum or Vop are reported to relieve cerebellar tremor.",nan; MOTOR CORTEX; UNIT ANALYSIS; NUCLEAR GROUP; RHESUS-MONKEY; PARKINSONIAN TREMOR; MOVEMENT; MICROSTIMULATION; ORGANIZATION; LIMB; PROJECTIONS

These data were compared to the total population of LCN neurons as determined by Nissl stain. In 4 Macaca fascicularis and one Saimiri sciureus the average size of the thalamic projection from LCN was found to be 506 +/- 94 cells contralateral to the injections. Thalamically projecting LCN neurons were located between the lower medulla and the third cervical segment; approximately 90% of these cells were in the first two cervical segments. Morphologic analysis of thalamically projecting LCN cells showed that they were smaller in size, and more oblong in shape in caudal regions of the nucleus. In 3 macaques, the average total number of LCN cells was determined to be 1617 +/- 908 on one side, in Nissl material. In these Nissl-stained preparations LCN neurons were found as far caudal as the fourth cervical segment; 68% were located in the first two cervical segments. Hence, thalamically projecting LCN neurons in the monkey are located in the rostral portion of the nucleus and comprise about one-third of the total population. Comparison of these data with reports in the literature imply that, unlike the cat, the major projection from LCN in monkeys is to the mesencephalon rather than to the thalamus.",HORSERADISH PEROXIDASE; SPINAL CORD; MACACA; SAIMIRI; CELL COUNT; ASCENDING SOMATOSENSORY PROJECTIONS; PRIMATE SPINOTHALAMIC PATHWAYS; DORSAL COLUMN NUCLEI; SPINOCERVICAL TRACT; SPINOMESENCEPHALIC TRACT; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; RETROGRADE TRANSPORT; AOTUS-TRIVIRGATUS; INFERIOR OLIVE; SPINAL-CORD

Using [C-11](R)PKI1195, a sensitive in vivo marker of glial cell activation, and PET, we provide first evidence that limb denervation induces a trans-synaptic increase in [C-11](R)-PKI1195 binding in the human thalamus but not somatosensory cortex: these brain structures appeared morphologically normal on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The increased thalamic signal was detectable many years after nerve injury, indicating persistent reorganization of the thalamus. This glial activation, beyond the first-order projection area of the injured neurons, may reflect continually altered afferent activity. Our findings support the view that long-term rearrangement of cortical representational maps is significantly determined within the thalamus.

Normal right-handed subjects (eight men, eight women, average age=32 years) viewed four types of stimuli positioned to the right or left of the central fixation point (left hemifield-large letter, left hemitield-small letter display with flanking letters; fight hemifield-large letter, fight hemifield-small letter display with flankers). BOLD responses to small letters surrounded by flankers were compared with responses to large isolated letters. To examine maximum functional regional connectivity, we modeled subject as a random effect and attained fixed effect parameter estimates and t-statistics for functional connectivity between each of the thalamic nuclei (pulvinar, medial dorsal, and anterior) as the seed region and each non-seed voxel. Greater BOLD activation for letters surrounded by flankers than for large letters was observed in the pulvinar as anticipated and was also marked in the medial dorsal nucleus (MDN), anterior and superior cingulate (BA24 and BA24' dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and frontal operculum and insula. For the MDN, maximal functional connectivity was with the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; correlations with left superior temporal, parietal, posterior frontal, and occipital regions were also observed.

Consequently, a hypothetical disruption of functions mediated by the pulvinar may help understand common visual and nonvisual symptoms in patients with Alzheimer's disease. To test this hypothesis, the pulvinar nuclei of nine patients with histologically confirmed Alzheimer's disease and twelve young (9-28 years of age) and age-matched controls (without dementia and with non-Alzheimer dementias) were examined using a battery of histopathological methods. All patients with Alzheimer's disease had numerous amyloid plaques and some neuritic plaques throughout the various subdivisions of the pulvinar. Neuropil threads were also present among the senile plaques, and neurofibrillary tangles occurred in clusters throughout the nucleus. Control patients with and without dementia had very few Alzheimer lesions, which should be expected in normal elderly individuals. The lesions in the pulvinar may help understand some of the clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease, including deficits in attention and in a host of visual disturbances. Such deficits may be the result of involvement of reciprocal thalamo-cortical and cortico-thalamo-cortical circuits that appear to be critical for the function of a vast expanse of association cortices interconnected with the pulvinar, which are heavily laden with lesions themselves.",ALZHEIMERS DISEASE; ATTENTION; NEUROFIBRILLARY TANGLES; NEUROPIL THREADS; PULVINAR; SENILE PLAQUES; THALAMUS; MONKEY MACACA-MULATTA; INFERIOR PARIETAL LOBULE; RHESUS-MONKEY; STRIATE CORTEX; NEUROFIBRILLARY TANGLES; NEURITIC PLAQUES; CORTICAL PROJECTIONS; LATERAL PULVINAR; ORGANIZATION; DEGENERATION

The human MD thalamic nucleus has been implicated in a great variety of different clinical conditions and normal functions ranging from schizophrenia, Parkinsonism and epilepsy to many cognitive functions. In the rat the MD thalamic nucleus is divided into three cytoarchitectonic sectors whereas in the primates it is divided into two; medial one-third (magnocellular) and lateral two-thirds further the lateral sector is divided into pars parvocellularis pars multiformis, pars fasciculosa and pars caudalis. In this study we used a retrograde tracer, fluoro-gold (FG) to evaluate some of the afferents reaching the lateral sector of the MD (MDl) thalamic nucleus. The results of the present study have shown that MDl receives afferent connections from the lateral cerebellar nucleus (dentate nucleus), substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNR) and zona incerta (ZI). Subsequent to FG injections into the MDl, labeled cells were observed mainly bilaterally but were sparser on the contralateral side than ipsilaterally from each of the three structures listed. All three afferents showed a topographical organization. The labeled neurons were localized at the dorsomedial aspect of the lateral cerebellar nucleus, the dorsoventral aspect of the SNR and in the dorsal sector of the ZI. The lateral cerebellar nucleus reached the MDl via the superior cerebellar peduncle. No other deep cerebellar nuclei showed labeled cells. There were no labeled cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNC). Although the three regions identified here are recognized as having motor functions, the connections to MD suggest that their outputs also play a role in cognitive or other higher cortical functions.",Tract tracing; retrograde; cerebellum; zona incerta; substantia nigra; mediodorsal thalamic nucleus; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PARS RETICULATA; BASAL-GANGLIA; NIGROTHALAMIC PROJECTIONS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; BRAIN-STEM; NERVE-CELL; ORGANIZATION; CONNECTIONS

Anat. Entwicklungsgesch. 129:53-82). The present study examined their possible contribution to the development of other thalamic nuclei. Postmortem brain tissue from human fetuses ranging between 10.5 and 40 weeks of gestation (wg) was processed by Nissl staining, Golgi impregnation, and MAP2 (microtubule-associated protein 2) immunocytochemistry. The gangliothalamic body, suggested to serve as a conduit for cells migrating from the ganglionic eminence to the thalamus, was found in the period from 15 to 34 wg in all rostrocaudal thalamic regions, particularly at the level of the anterior nuclear complex, mediodorsal and pulvinar nucleus, and in addition, the lateral geniculate nucleus. In Nissl-stained sections, the gangliothalamic body is a thin cellular layer situated beneath the thalamic surface, near the telencephalo-diencephalic junction. In Golgi- and MAP2-stained sections, it is a stream of mostly bipolar cells extending from the ganglionic eminence to the medial thalamus. In addition, MAP2-immunoreactivity confirms the neuronal nature of its cells. The present study further supports the hypothesis that certain neurons migrate from the ganglionic eminence to the thalamus through the transient gangliothalamic body during fetal development. Moreover, our data indicate that both the association (mediodorsal and pulvinar), as well as the anterior (limbic) and specific relay nuclei are potential recipients of the telencephalic neurons.

The anatomy and connectivity of the primate auditory cortex has been modeled as a core region receiving direct thalamic input surrounded by a belt of secondary fields. The core contains multiple tonotopic fields (including the primary auditory cortex, AI, and the rostral field, R), but available data only partially address the degree to which those fields are functionally distinct. This report, based on single-unit recordings across four hemispheres in awake macaques, argues that the functional organization of auditory cortex is best understood in terms of temporal processing. Frequency tuning, response threshold, and strength of activation are similar between AI and R, validating their inclusion as a unified core, but the temporal properties of the fields clearly differ. Onset latencies to pure tones are longer in R (median, 33 ms) than in AI (20 ms); moreover, synchronization of spike discharges to dynamic modulations of stimulus amplitude and frequency, similar to those present in macaque and human vocalizations, suggest distinctly different windows of temporal integration in AI (20-30 ms) and R (100 ms). Incorporating data from the adjacent auditory belt reveals that the divergence of temporal properties within the core is in some cases greater than the temporal differences between core and belt.",nan; BINDING PROTEIN IMMUNOREACTIVITY; AMPLITUDE-MODULATED SOUNDS; RHESUS-MONKEY; RESPONSE PROPERTIES; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; TONOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; NEURAL REPRESENTATIONS; FREQUENCY MODULATIONS; INFERIOR COLLICULUS; ACOUSTIC FEATURES

Comparable projections have yet to be described in the primate brain, where part of the problem has been in effectively delineating these nuclei. Immunohistochemical staining of tissue from a series of macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta) showed that cells in the region of both the ventral and dorsal tegmental nuclei selectively stain for parvalbumin, thus helping to reveal these nuclei. These same tegmental nuclei were not selectively revealed when tissue was stained for SMI32, acetylcholinesterase, calbindin, or calretinin. In a parallel study, horseradish peroxidase was injected into the mammillary bodies of five cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). Retrogradely labeled neurons were consistently found in the three subdivisions of the ventral tegmental nucleus of Gudden, which are located immediately below, within, and above the medial longitudinal fasciculus. Further projections to the mammillary body region arose from cells in the anterior tegmental nucleus, which appears to be a rostral continuation of the infrafascicular part of the ventral tegmental nucleus. In the dorsal tegmental nucleus of Gudden, labeled cells were most evident when the tracer injection was more laterally placed in the mammillary bodies, consistent with a projection to the lateral mammillary nucleus. The present study not only demonstrates that the primate mammillary bodies receive parallel inputs from the dorsal and ventral tegmental nuclei of Gudden, but also helps to confirm the extent of these poorly distinguished nuclei in the monkey brain.

This study was aimed at discovery of such a radioligand from a group of CAF(1), receptor ligands based on a core 3-(phenylamino)-pyrazin-2(1H)-one scaffold. Methods: CRF1 receptor ligands were selected for development as possible PET radioligands based on their binding potency at CRF1 receptors (displacement of [I-128]CRF from rat cortical membranes), measured lipophilicity, autoradiographic binding profile in rat and rhesus monkey brain sections, rat biodistribution, and suitability for radiolabeling with carbon-11 or fluorine-18. Two identified candidates (BMS-721313 and BMS-732098) were labeled with fluorine-18. A third candidate (BMS-709460) was labeled with carbon-11 and all three radioligands were evaluated in PET experiments in rhesus monkey. CRF1 receptor density (B-rnax) was assessed in rhesus brain cortical and cerebellum membranes with the CRF1 receptor ligand, [H-3]BMS-728300. Results: The three ligands selected for development showed high binding affinity (IC50 values, 0.3-8 nM) at CRF1 receptors and moderate lipophilicity (LogD, 2.8-4.4). [H-3]BMS-728300 and the two F-18-labeled ligands showed region-specific binding in rat and rhesus monkey brain autoradiography, namely higher binding density in the frontal and limbic cortex, and cerebellum than in thalamus and brainstem. CRF1 receptor B-max, in rhesus brain was found to be 50-120 fmol/mg protein across cortical regions and cerebellum. PET experiments in rhesus monkey showed that the radioligands [F-18]BMS-721313, [F-18]BMS-732098 and [C-11]BMS-709460 gave acceptably high brain radioactivity uptake but no indication of the specific binding as seen in vitro. Conclusions: Candidate CRF1 receptor PET radioligands were identified but none proved to be effective for imaging monkey brain CRF1 receptors. Higher affinity radioligands are likely required for successful PET imaging of CRF1 receptors. (c) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

Thionin-stained sections in different planes showed that this is a subregion of lamina I containing clusters of neurons that appear to have pyramidal or polygonal somata. Extracellular microelectrode recordings in this region revealed clusters of thermoreceptive specific (COLD) cells with nasal or labial receptive fields, whereas nociceptive neurons were found in the adjacent portions of lamina I. Anterograde tracer injections in this region produced trigeminothalamic terminal labeling in the site homologous to the lamina I spino-thalamo-cortical relay nucleus identified previously in the Old World macaque monkey and in humans. Retrograde tracer injections involving this thalamic site, where recordings of trigeminal COLD-like neurons were obtained, produced clusters of retrogradely labeled trigeminothalamic neurons in this immunohistochemically distinct subregion of lamina I, nearly all of which are pyramidal neurons. We conclude that the nocturnal owl monkey has a specialized perinasal thermoreceptive trigeminothalamic sensory pathway that is probably of behavioral significance during olfactory sniffing. In addition, these observations corroborate other findings that have indicated that lamina I COLD cells are pyramidal neurons and are not physiologically modulated by substance P or serotonin, in contrast to nociceptive neurons.

Secondary pathways involving superior colliculus, koniocellular lateral geniculate nucleus and pulvinar and their V1-bypassing projections to higher order cortex are known to exist. While they may form an evolutionary old visual system, their contribution to perception and visually guided behaviour remain largely obscure. Recent developments in tract tracing and circuit manipulation technologies provide new insights. Here we discuss how secondary visual pathways mediate residual vision (blindsight) after V1 injury by relaying signals directly into higher order cortical areas. We contrast these findings on blindsight with new studies on dyslexia suggesting that dysfunction of secondary visual pathways might contribute to dyslexic's perceptual difficulties. Emerging from these considerations, secondary visual pathways involving koniocellular LGN may be critical for detection of visual change, whereas pulvinar function appears more linked to visuomotor planning.",nan; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; STRIATE CORTEX; RESPONSE PROPERTIES; AREAS MT; MACAQUE; NEURONS; PROJECTION; PATHWAY; LESIONS

Herein, using a battery of complementary morphological approaches, including cytoarchitecture, myeloarchitecture and the expression of molecular markers, we pinpoint the features or combination of features that best characterize each nucleus of the pretectothalamic transitional zone of the rat. Our results reveal useful morphological criteria to identify and delineate, with unprecedented precision, several [mostly auditory] nuclei of the posterior group of the thalamus, namely the pretectothalamic lamina (PTL; formerly known as the posterior limitans nucleus), the medial division of the medial geniculate body (MGBm), the suprageniculate nucleus (SG), and the ethmoid, posterior triangular and posterior nuclei of the thalamus. The PTL is a sparsely-celled and fiber rich flattened nucleus apposed to the lateral surface of the anterior pretectal nucleus (APT) that marks the border between the pretectum and the thalamus; this structure stains selectively with the Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA), and is essentially immunonegative for the calcium binding protein parvalbumin (PV). The MGBm, located medial to the ventral division of the MGB (MGBv), can be unequivocally identified by the large size of many of its neurons, its dark immunostaining for PV, and its rather selective staining for WFA. The SG, which extends for a considerable caudorostral distance and deviates progressively from the MGB, is characterized by its peculiar cytoarchitecture, the paucity of myelinated fibers, and the conspicuous absence of staining for calretinin (CR); indeed, in many CR-stained sections, the SG stands out as a blank spot. Because most of these nuclei are small and show unique anatomical relationships, the information provided in this article will facilitate the interpretation of the results of experimental manipulations aimed at the auditory thalamus and improve the design of future investigations. Moreover, the previously neglected proximity between the MGBm and the caudal region of the scarcely known PTL raises the possibility that certain features or roles traditionally attributed to the MGBm may actually belong to the PTL.",auditory thalamus; posterior limitans nucleus of the thalamus; suprageniculate nucleus; medial geniculate body; anterior pretectal nucleus; ethmoid nucleus; Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA); rat; MEDIAL GENICULATE-BODY; HAMSTER INTERGENICULATE LEAFLET; INFERIOR COLLICULUS; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; AUDITORY-CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; ASCENDING PROJECTIONS; PERINEURONAL NETS; POSTERIOR GROUP; RAT-BRAIN

Most of these studies were performed with nocturnal animals, particularly mice and rats. In the current study, the PK2 and its receptor, PKR2, was cloned from a species of diurnal macaque monkey. The macaque monkey PK2 and PKR2 were found to be highly homologous to that of other mammalian species. The mRNA expression of PK2 and PKR2 in the macaque brain was examined by in situ hybridization. The expression patterns of PK2 and PKR2 in the macaque brain were found to be quite similar to that of the mouse brain. Particularly, PK2 mRNA was shown to oscillate in the SCN of the macaque brain in the same phase and with similar amplitude with that of nocturnal mouse brain. PKR2 expression was also detected in known primary SCN targets, including the midline thalamic and hypothalamic nuclei. In addition, we detected the expression of PKR2 mRNA in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DR) of both macaque and mouse brains. As a likely SCN to dorsal raphe projection has previously been indicated, the expression of PKR2 in the raphe nuclei of both macaque and mouse brain signifies a possible role of DR as a previously unrecognized primary SCN projection target.",Prokineticin 2; G protein-coupled receptor; circadian clock; suprachiasmatic nucleus; monkey; diurnal; SUPRACHIASMATIC NUCLEUS; CIRCADIAN CLOCK; EFFERENT PROJECTIONS; SEROTONIN RELEASE; GENE-EXPRESSION; DIURNAL RODENT; RAT; NEURONS; RHYTHMS; OUTPUT

Although it is tempting to relegate them to a subsidiary role in visual processing, because their supposed latency and lag might appear to be unfavourable for an involvement in fast processing, this is a dangerous simplification. Certainly for the world in motion, feedback from higher motion areas can influence the transfer of ascending input when, or even before, the input arrives. Here, we consider the circuit formed by layer 6 feedback cells in the visual cortex and how this straddles the retinothalamic and thalamocortical transfer of visual input. We discuss its links to feedback from the cortical motion area MT (V5), and suggest that motion perception involves a dynamic interplay between MT, V1 and the thalamus.

SUMMARY ANSWER Behavioral, pharmacological and in vivo brain imaging findings indicate that pain can be quantified in macaques with endometriosis. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY Endometriosis is characterized by abdominopelvic hypersensitity. The mechanism by which endometriosis evokes pain is largely unknown, as currently available analgesics offer limited pain relief. Thus, there is a need for both greater understanding of the in vivo mechanism of endometriosis-associated pain and better methods of testing novel therapeutics. STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION Pain-related behavior and brain activation were assessed in five cynomolgus macaques with endometriosis. Three healthy female macaques served as controls. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS Abdominopelvic sensitivity to force was assessed with an algometer. Activation of brain areas using block design force stimulation and the effects of a single dose of the analgesic drug morphine and 2-month treatment with the progestin dienogest on brain activation were observed via functional magnetic resonance imaging. MAIN RESULTS AND THE ROLE OF CHANCE Pain response thresholds in macaques with endometriosis were significantly less than that of healthy macaques (P = 0.0003). In addition, non-noxious force activated the insula and thalamus, which was reduced with morphine and 2-month dienogest treatment. LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION The specific role of cysts, such as peritoneal cysts, in endometriosis pain was not explored. While non-noxious stimulation activated the insula and thalamus, macaques were sedated during fMRI scans. Current findings need further confirmation in a larger cohort. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS The current study demonstrated central sensitization and related pain behavior in macaques with naturally occurring endometriosis. Altered functioning of the central nervous system could be the focus of future mechanistic studies and for the development of novel therapeutics.

To answer this question, we first located flexible and stable value-coding areas in the caudate head (CDh) and caudate tail (CDt) of two rhesus macaque monkeys, and then injected different retrograde tracers into these areas of each monkey. We found that CDh and CDt received different inputs from several cortical and subcortical areas including temporal cortex, prefrontal cortex, cingulate cortex, amygdala, claustrum and thalamus. Superior temporal cortex and inferior temporal cortex projected to both CDh and CDt, with more CDt-projecting than CDh-projecting neurons. In superior temporal cortex and dorsal inferior temporal cortex, layers 3 and 5 projected to CDh while layers 3 and 6 projected to CDt. Prefrontal and cingulate cortex projected mostly to CDh bilaterally, less to CDt unilaterally. A cluster of neurons in the basolateral amygdala projected to CDt. Rostral-dorsal claustrum projected to CDh while caudal-ventral claustrum projected to CDt. Within the thalamus, different nuclei projected to either CDh or CDt. The medial centromedian nucleus and lateral parafascicular nucleus projected to CDt while the medial parafascicular nucleus projected to CDh. The inferior pulvinar and lateral dorsal nuclei projected to CDt. The ventral anterior and medial dorsal nuclei projected to CDh. We found little evidence of neurons projecting to both CDh and CDt across the brain. These data suggest that CDh and CDt can control separate functions using anatomically separate circuits. Understanding the roles of these striatal projections will be important for understanding how value memories are created and stored.",basal ganglia; caudate; neural pathways; object value learning; rhesus monkey; PRIMARY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; BASAL GANGLIA CIRCUITS; LAYER VI NEURONS; MACAQUE MONKEY; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; CORTICOSTRIATAL PROJECTIONS; NEUROFILAMENT PROTEIN; RHESUS-MONKEY; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE

In guinea pigs, although alternating bilateral jaw movements are usually seen during natural chewing, it is still unclear which cortical areas are responsible for chewing-like RJM. To address this issue, we first defined the cortical areas inducing chewing-like RJM by intracortical microstimulation. Stimulation of the most lateral area of the CMA, the granular cortex, induced chewing-like RJM, but from the region medial to this area, simple vertical RJM were induced. Subsequently, to reveal the properties of these two areas in the CMA, the connections between the CMA and the dorsal thalamus were examined by neuronal tract-tracing techniques. The area inducing chewing-like RJM possessed strong reciprocal connections, mainly with the medial part of the ventral posteromedial nucleus, which is the sensory-relay thalamus. On the other hand, the simple vertical RJM-inducing area had reciprocal connections with the motor thalamus. The present study suggests that the CMA inducing chewing-like RJM is different from the CMA inducing simple vertical RJM, and plays a role in cortically induced chewing-like RIM under the influence of the sensory thalamus in guinea pigs.

This report focuses on STT input to the ventral lateral nucleus (VL), where prior anterograde tracing studies identified dense or moderately dense STT terminations. Large and very large injections in VL produced large numbers of labeled cells predominantly in laminae V and VII (more than half as many as from massive injections in the entire thalamus). Medium-sized and small injections in VL labeled STT cells almost exclusively in laminae V and VII, in segments consistent with the coarse mediolateral VL topography; few or no cells were labeled in lamina I. All injections labeled the deep cerebellar nuclei (see accompanying article: Evrard and Craig, 2008). Notably, even the most anterior injection in VL that produced dense pallidal labeling still labeled both STT and deep cerebellar cells. These observations indicate that VL receives STT input originating from laminae V and VII neurons that may be coextensive with its cerebellothalamic input. These findings support the role of laminae V and VII STT cells in sensorimotor integration and suggest a significant ongoing influence on both motor and premotor thalamocortical function. Together with the preceding observations of selective STT projections to other thalamic regions, these results provide compelling evidence that the primate STT consists of anatomically and functionally differentiable components.",sensorimotor; somatosensory; integration; cerebellothalamic; motor; DORSAL COLUMN NUCLEI; II MUSCLE AFFERENTS; ROSTRAL BRAIN-STEM; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; MOTOR CORTEX; SPINAL-CORD; THALAMIC NUCLEI; LAMINA-I; SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS; REFLEX PATHWAYS

This unique connectivity suggests that the TRN plays a pivotal role in regulating information flow through the thalamus. Here, we analyzed the roles of TRN neurons in visually guided reaching movements. We first used retrograde transneuronal labeling with rabies virus, and showed that the rostro-dorsal sector of the TRN (TRNrd) projected disynaptically to the ventral premotor cortex (PMv). In other experiments, we recorded neurons from the TRNrd or PMv while monkeys performed a visuomotor task. We found that neurons in the TRNrd and PMv showed visual-, set-, and movement-related activity modulation. These results indicate that the TRNrd, as well as the PMv, is involved in the reception of visual signals and in the preparation and execution of reaching movements. The fraction of neurons that were non-selective for the location of visual signals or the direction of reaching movements was greater in the TRNrd than in the PMv. Furthermore, the fraction of neurons whose activity increased from the baseline was greater in the TRNrd than in the PMv. The timing of activity modulation of visualrelated and movement-related neurons was similar in TRNrd and PMv neurons. Overall, our data suggest that TRNrd neurons provide motor thalamic nuclei with inhibitory inputs that are predominantly devoid of spatial selectivity, and that these signals modulate how these nuclei engage in both sensory processing and motor output during visually guided reaching behavior.",action; nonhuman primates; premotor cortex; reaching movement; visuomotor control; VENTRAL PREMOTOR CORTEX; 3 MOTOR AREAS; POSTERIOR MEDIAL THALAMUS; MULTISYNAPTIC PROJECTIONS; SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; MACAQUE MONKEYS; NEURAL REPRESENTATIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SENSORY SELECTION

To understand the neural mechanism of this transformation process, we examined whether or not the information represented in individual MD neuron's activity changes during a trial of the task. Two monkeys performed two oculomotor delayed-response tasks (an ordinary and a rotatory oculomotor delayed-response task). As MD neurons show directional delay-period activity, we compared the directional selectivity of the same MD neuron between these two tasks and determined whether the activity represented the cue direction or the saccade direction. Among the 26 MD neurons that showed directional delay-period activity, representing information of 27% of neurons gradually altered from the visual domain to the oculomotor domain, while the remaining neurons kept holding either the visual or the oculomotor information throughout the delay period. These results indicate that gradual alteration of information representing in individual MD neurons during the delay period plays an important role in spatial working-memory performance. This alteration could be performed by interactions among MD neurons representing different information during the delay period.",delay-period activity; information transformation; monkey; spatial working memory; thalamic mediodorsal nucleus; POPULATION VECTOR ANALYSIS; FRONTAL EYE FIELD; WORKING-MEMORY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; NUCLEUS; LOBE; ORGANIZATION; PROJECTIONS; EFFERENTS

The ligand has high affinity for alpha(4)beta(2) nAChRs (K-D=50pM), crosses the blood-brain barrier, and distributes in the monkey brain in a pattern consistent with that of alpha(4)beta(2) nAChRs. The specific/non-specific binding ratio increased steadily, reaching a value of 3.3 in the thalamus at 4 h. The specific binding of 2-[F-18]F-A-85380 Was reversed by cytisine.

This study aimed to further explore white matter abnormalities in OCD patients through diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) and tractography of the two white matter tracts which most probably play an important role in OCD neuropathology: the anterior segment of cingulum bundles (ACB) and the anterior thalamic radiations (ATR). Twelve right-handed, medicated adult patients with OCD and 12 matched controls underwent DSI on a 3 tesla magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) system. Tractography based on DSI data was reconstructed to define the ACB and ATR. Mean generalized fractional anisotropy (GFA) was calculated for each targeted tract and was used to analyze local changes in microstructural integrity along individual tracts. There was a significantly lower mean GFA in both the right ATR and left ACB in OCD subjects compared to controls. OCD subjects also demonstrated decreased left-lateralized asymmetry of the ACB when compared to controls. Furthermore, the mean GFA of the left ACB positively correlated with OCD subjects' obsessive subscores on the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive scale. This study supports the white matter abnormalities in the ACB and ATR of OCD subjects, which corroborates neurobiological models that posit a defect in fronto-striato-thalamic circuitry in OCD.

Specific HRP pressure injections to the rostral RNT(1.6-1.8 mm caudal to bregma) resulted in retrograde labelling of neurones in the cerebellar nuclei. The rostral RNT showed specific topographical organization of its cerebellar connections. Microinjections into the rostral RNT, 1.6 mm caudal to bregma, produced numerous HRP-labelled neurones within the anterior interposed (emboliform nucleus) and scarce HRP-labelled neurones within the lateral (dentate nucleus) cerebellar nuclei, whereas injections into the rostral RNT, 1.8 mm caudal to bregma, produced numerous HRP-labelled neurones within the posterior interposed (globose nucleus) and scarce lightly HRP-labelled neurones within the lateral (dentate nucleus) cerebellar nuclei. Cerebellar connections with the rostral RNT were exclusively ipsilateral to the injection site. No HRP-labelled cells were detected in the medial (fastigial nucleus) cerebellar nucleus. The cerebellar connections reach the RNT via the superior cerebellar peduncle. By contrast, HRP injections into the anterior, posterior interposed and lateral cerebellar nuclei produced no labelled cells within the RNT. This study demonstrates the existence of direct cerebello-RNT but not RNT-cerebellar connections.

Dense global subnetworks of these pathways have often been studied, primarily due to their functional implications. Instead we study sparse local subnetworks of the pathways to establish the role of a brain area in enabling shortest path communication between its non-adjacent topological neighbours. We propose a novel metric to measure the topological communication load on a vertex due to its immediate neighbourhood, and show that in terms of distribution of this local communication load, a network of Macaque long distance pathways is substantially different from other real world networks and random graph models. Macaque network contains the entire range of local subnetworks, from star-like networks to clique-like networks, while other networks tend to contain a relatively small range of subnetworks. Further, sparse local subnetworks in the Macaque network are not only found across topographical super-areas, e.g., lobes, but also within a super-area, arguing that there is conservation of even relatively short-distance pathways. To establish the communication role of a vertex we borrow the concept of brokerage from social science, and present the different types of brokerage roles that brain areas play, highlighting that not only the thalamus, but also cingulate gyrus and insula often act as relays for areas in the neocortex.

In the present study, based on neural tracer injections in different parts of the striatum in macaques of either sex, we analyzed and compared qualitatively and quantitatively the distribution of labeled CSt cells in the two hemispheres. The results showed that crossed CSt projections to the caudate and the putamen can be relatively robust (up to 30% of total labeled cells). The origin of the direct and the crossed CSt projections was not symmetrical as the crossed ones originated almost exclusively from motor, prefrontal, and cingulate areas and not from parietal and temporal areas. Furthermore, there were several cases in which the contribution of contralateral areas tended to equal that of the ipsilateral ones.

Thalamic neurons that receive synaptic input from the globus pallidus or the cerebellar nuclei were identified in awake monkeys trained to perform an arm-reaching task. The location of electrophysiologically identified cerebellar-receiving (CR) and pallidal-receiving (PR) neurons was used to identify a total of 264 thalamic neurons in cerebellar (CB) or pallidal (GP) regions of the thalamus. 2. Stimulation in the brachium conjunctivum or white matter adjacent to the cerebellar nuclei excited 85 neurons in the thalamus at short latencies. These CR neurons were located in the oral portion of the ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPLo), in caudal portions of the ventral lateral nucleus (VLc), and in area X. 3. Stimulation in the internal globus pallidus (GPi) inhibited 10 thalamic neurons at short latency. These PR neurons were located in rostral portions of VLc, in the oral part of the ventral lateral nucleus (VLo), and in the parvicellular part of the ventral anterior nucleus (VApc). 4. There was no clear single somatotopic organization of neurons in CB and GP regions of the thalamus, as defined by free-form responses to passive manipulation and observation of eye movements. There was, in fact, a tendency for two representations, each, of the head/eye/mouth cells and cells with modifications of activity in response to manipulation of the arm. 5. During the hold period before illumination of a visual target, the mean firing rates and variability of discharge of arm-related CR and PR neurons did not differ significantly. This was also true for the total sample of arm-related neurons in the CB versus GP regions. 6. The activity of many neurons in both the CB and GP regions began to change before the reaching movement and, for some, before the earliest recorded changes in electromyographic (EMG) activity. The initial change was an increase in discharge for > 75% of the cells studied in both the CB and GP regions. 7. During the reaching task, there also was no significant difference in the time of the initial change in discharge of neurons in the CB versus GP regions of the thalamus. 8. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the initial task-related change in discharge of PR thalamic neurons is dominated by input from the cerebral cortex and that pallidal input modulates later phases of their movement-related changes in activity.",nan; GOAL-DIRECTED MOVEMENT; SINGLE CELL DISCHARGE; NIGRA PARS RETICULATA; PRIMATE MOTOR CORTEX; GLOBUS PALLIDUS; SUBSTANTIA NIGRA; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; MACACA-FASCICULARIS; BASAL GANGLIA; ARM MOVEMENTS

Accordingly, we used in vitro slices from which to record and labeled cells in the middle layers of the cat auditory and visual cortices to compare basic anatomical and physiological features of cells recovered in similar layers using the same methods. Our results demonstrate a striking difference in a basic characteristic of two primary sensory cortical areas. In the visual cortex, spiny stellate cells predominate, receive short-latency synaptic inputs, and project to supergranular layers. No such spiny stellate population is encountered in the middle layers of the auditory cortex. Spiny cells that are not stellate or pyramidal are occasionally encountered but, as a group, do not display consistent anatomical or physiological features that might allow them to function as auditory cortical versions of the visual spiny stellates.

To probe the function of CG feedback in a causal manner, we selectively and reversibly manipulated the activity of CG neurons in anesthetized ferrets in vivo using a combined viral-infection and optogenetics approach to drive expression of channelrhodopsin2 (ChR2) in CG neurons. We observed significant increases in temporal precision and spatial resolution of LGN neuronal responses to drifting grating and white noise stimuli when CG neurons expressing ChR2 were light activated. Enhancing CG feedback reduced visually evoked response latencies, increased spike-timing precision, and reduced classical receptive field size. Increased precision among LGN neurons led to increased spike-timing precision among granular layer V1 neurons as well. Together, our findings suggest that the function of CG feedback is to control the timing and precision of thalamic responses to incoming visual signals.",corticothalamic; LGN; V1; feedback; optogenetics; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; CORTICOTHALAMIC FEEDBACK; MACAQUE MONKEY; CORTICOFUGAL FEEDBACK; CORTICAL FEEDBACK; STRIATE CORTEX; RABIES VIRUS; GAIN-CONTROL; LAYER 6; THALAMUS

In three experiments using blood-oxygen level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging, we examined the neural substrates of acquired auditory-tactile synesthesia, in which certain sounds can produce an intense somatosensory tingling sensation in a patient with a thalamic lesion. Compared with nine normal controls, the first experiment showed that the patient had a threefold greater BOLD response to sounds in the parietal operculum, the location of secondary somatosensory cortex. We hypothesized that this abnormal opercular activity might be the neural substrate of the patient's synesthesia. Supporting this hypothesis, the second experiment demonstrated that sounds that produced no somatosensation did not evoke a BOLD response in the operculum, while sounds that produced strong somatosensations evoked large BOLD responses. These abnormal responses may have resulted from plasticity induced by the loss of somatosensory inputs. Consistent with this idea, in the third experiment, BOLD responses to somatosensory stimulation were significantly weaker in the patient's operculum than in normal controls. These experiments demonstrate a double dissociation in the patient's secondary somatosensory cortex (increased responses to auditory stimulation and decreased responses to somatosensory stimulation), and suggest both that stroke-induced plasticity can result in abnormal connections between sensory modalities that are normally separate, and that synesthesia can be caused by inappropriate connections between nearby cortical territories.",somatosensory; multisensory integration; auditory; tactile; thalamus; stroke; POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; AUDITORY ASSOCIATION CORTEX; HUMAN SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL SULCUS; HUMAN BRAIN; ANATOMICAL EVIDENCE; MACAQUE MONKEY; STIMULATION; INTEGRATION; PERCEPTION

Angiotensin IV binds to a high affinity site that is quite distinct in pharmacology and distribution from the angiotensin II AT(1) and AT(2) receptors and is known as the AT(4) receptor. These observations suggest that the AT(4) receptor may have multiple central effects. The present study uses in vitro receptor autoradiography, and employs [I-125]angiotensin IV to map AT(4) receptors in the macaca fascicularis brain. The distribution of the AT(4) receptor is remarkable in that its distribution extends throughout several neural systems. Most striking is its localization in motor nuclei and motor associated regions. These include the ventral horn spinal motor neurons, all cranial motor nuclei including the oculomotor, abducens, facial and hypoglossal nuclei, and the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. Receptors are also present in the vestibular, reticular and inferior olivary nuclei, the granular layer of the cerebellum, and the Betz cells of the motor cortex. Moderate AT(4) receptor density is seen in all cerebellar nuclei, ventral thalamic nuclei and the substantia nigra pars compacta, with lower receptor density observed in the caudate nucleus and putamen. Abundant AT(4) receptors are also found in areas associated with cholinergic nuclei and their projections, including the nucleus basalis of Meynert, ventral limb of the diagonal band and the hippocampus, somatic motor nuclei and autonomic preganglionic motor nuclei. AT(4) receptors are also observed in sensory regions, with moderate levels in spinal trigeminal, gracile, cuneate and thalamic ventral posterior nuclei, and the somatosensory cortex. The abundance of the AT(4) receptor in motor and cholinergic neurons, and to a lesser extent, in sensory neurons, suggests multiple roles for the AT(4) receptor in the primate brain.",motor neuron; sensory neuron; cholinergic neuron; cognition; VASCULAR SMOOTH-MUSCLE; ANGIOTENSIN-IV; BINDING-SITE; CHOLINE-ACETYLTRANSFERASE; CORTICAL CONNECTIONS; RHESUS-MONKEY; RAT-BRAIN; CORTEX; CELLS

Damage to the medial, magnocellular part of the mediodorsal thalamus (MDmc) impairs cognitive functions dependent on prefrontal cortex, including memory. The contribution of MDmc to other aspects of cognition dependent on prefrontal cortex has not been determined. The ability of monkeys to adjust their choice behavior in response to changes in reinforcer value, a capacity impaired by lesions of orbital prefrontal cortex, can be tested in a reinforcer devaluation paradigm. In the present study, rhesus monkeys with bilateral neurotoxic MDmc lesions were tested in the devaluation procedure. Monkeys learned visual discrimination problems in which each rewarded object is reliably paired with one of two different food rewards and then were given choices between pairs of rewarded objects, one associated with each food. Selective satiation of one of the food rewards reduces choices of objects associated with that food in normal monkeys. Monkeys with bilateral neurotoxic lesions of MDmc learned concurrently presented visual discrimination problems as quickly as unoperated control monkeys but showed impaired reinforcer devaluation effects. This finding suggests that the neural circuitry for control of behavioral choice by changes in reinforcer value includes MDmc.",amygdala; choice behavior; decision-making; devaluation; medial thalamus; orbitofrontal cortex; prefrontal cortex; reward; ORBITAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEYS; FRONTAL-LOBE; BASOLATERAL AMYGDALA; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; MACACA-FASCICULARIS; DOUBLE DISSOCIATION; KORSAKOFF PATIENTS; MEMORY; PROJECTIONS

To investigate the development of a major afferent input to the cortex, we studied the formation of thalamocortical connections in an organotypic culture system. Slices from the lateral thalamus of young rats were cocultured with slices from the visual cortex. Thalamocortical projections in vitro were examined anatomically with fluorescent dyes and physiologically with electrophysiological and optical recording techniques. Axons emerged from thalamic explants radially in all directions. The outgrowth of thalamic fibers and the course of the axonal trajectories were not influenced by the presence of the cocultured cortex. Only those thalamic axons that happened to grow toward the cortical slices invaded their target tissue. Thalamocortical projection cell in vitro had the characteristic morphology of thalamic relay neurons. Cells with the morphology of interneurons were present in thalamic explants, but these neurons did not project to the cocultured cortex. Thalamocortical axons in vitro terminated in their appropriate cortical target layer, formed axonal arbors, and made functional synaptic contacts. Such specific connections between thalamic neurons and their cortical target cells were established regardless of whether thalamocortical axons invaded the cortex from the white matter side or from the pial surface. These results suggest that thalamic projection neurons have an innate mechanism that allows them to recognize their cortical target cells. Thus, intrinsic factors play a significant role in the laminar specification of cortical connections during development.",nan; EARLY POSTNATAL-DEVELOPMENT; VASOACTIVE INTESTINAL POLYPEPTIDE; IDENTIFIED PROJECTION NEURONS; GABA-IMMUNOREACTIVE NEURONS; CENTRAL NERVOUS-SYSTEM; CAT CEREBRAL-CORTEX; SUBPLATE NEURONS; WHITE MATTER; OCCIPITAL CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY

This work assesses the in vivo binding and imaging characteristics of [F-18]nifene in rhesus monkeys for the development of PET experiments examining nAChR binding. Methods: Dynamic PET imaging experiments with [F-18]nifene were acquired in four anesthetized Macaca mulatta (rhesus) monkeys using a microPET P4 scanner. Data acquisition was initiated with a bolus injection of 109 +/- 17 MBq [F-18] nifene and the time course of the radioligand in the brain was measured for up to 120 min. For two experiments, a displacement dose of (-)nicotine (0.03 mg kg(-1), i.v.) was given 45-60 min post injection and followed 30 min later with a second [F-18]nifene injection to measure radioligand nondisplaceable uptake. Time activity curves were extracted in the regions of the antereoventral thalamus (AVT), lateral geniculate nucleus region (LGN), frontal cortex, and the cerebellum (CB). Results: The highest levels of [F-18]nifene uptake were observed in the AVT and LGN. Target-to-CB ratios reached maximum values of 3.3 +/- 0.4 in the AVT and 3.2 +/- 0.3 in the LGN 30-45 min postinjection. Significant binding of [F-18]nifene was observed in the subiculum, insula cortex, temporal cortex, cingulate gyrus, frontal cortex, striatum, and midbrain areas. The (-)nicotine displaced bound [F-18]nifene to near background levels within 15 min postdrug injection. No discernable displacement was observed in the CB, suggesting its potential as a reference region. Logan graphical estimates using the CB as a reference region yielded binding potentials of 1.6 +/- 0.2 in the AVT and 1.3 +/- 0.1 in the LGN. The postnicotine injection displayed uniform nondisplaceable uptake of [F-18]nifene throughout gray and white brain matter. Conclusions: [F-18]Nifene exhibits rapid equilibration and a moderately high target to background binding profile in the alpha 4 beta 2* nAChR rich regions of the brain, thus providing favorable imaging characteristics as a PET radiotracer for nAChR assay.

The present study addressed this question from the point of view of connectional properties by comparing the afferent and efferent projections of the caudal forelimb area (CFA), considered to be the equivalent of the forelimb area of the primary motor cortex (MI), and a second forelimb motor representation, the rostral forelimb area (RFA). As a result of various tracing experiments (including double labeling), it was observed that CFA and RFA had reciprocal corticocortical connections characterized by preferential, asymmetrical, laminar distribution, indicating that RFA may occupy a different hierarchical level than CFA, according to criteria previously discussed in the visual cortex of primates. Furthermore, it was found that RFA, but not CFA, exhibited dense reciprocal connections with the insular cortex. With respect to their efferent projection to the basal ganglia, it was observed that CFA projected very densely to the lateral portion of the ipsilateral caudate putamen, whereas the contralateral projection was sparse and more restricted. The ipsilateral projection originating from RFA was slightly less dense than that from CFA, but it covered a larger portion of the caudate putamen (in the medial direction); the contralateral projection from RFA to the caudate putamen was of the same density and extent as the ipsilateral projection. The reciprocal thalamocortical and corticothalamic connections of RFA and CFA differed from each other in the sense that CFA was mainly interconnected with the ventrolateral thalamic nucleus, while RFA was mainly connected with the ventromedial thalamic nucleus. Altogether, these connectional differences, compared with the pattern of organization of the motor cortical areas in primates, suggest that RFA in the rat may well be an equivalent of the premotor or supplementary motor area. In contrast to the corticocortical, corticostriatal, and thalamocortical connections, RFA and CFA showed similar efferent projections to the subthalamic nucleus, substantia nigra, red nucleus, tectum, pontine nuclei, inferior olive, and spinal cord.",MOTOR CORTEX; BASAL GANGLIA; THALAMUS; TRACING; DOUBLE LABELING; PHASEOLUS-VULGARIS LEUKOAGGLUTININ; BIOCYTIN; WGA-HRP; CHOLERA TOXIN; RAT; LEUKOAGGLUTININ PHA-L; RETROGRADE AXONAL-TRANSPORT; SOMATIC SENSORY CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; EFFERENT CONNECTIONS; INTRACORTICAL MICROSTIMULATION; CORTICOSPINAL PROJECTIONS; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; THALAMIC PROJECTIONS; AFFERENT CONNECTIONS

The visual system of macaque has been extensively characterized both anatomically and functionally. We have taken advantage of this to examine the influence of congenital blindness in a macaque model of developmental anophthalmia. Developmental anophthalmia in macaque effectively removes the normal influence of the thalamus on cortical development leading to an induced hybrid cortex (HC) combining features of primary visual and extrastriate cortex. Here we show that retrograde tracers injected in early visual areas, including HC, reveal a drastic reduction of cortical projections of the reduced lateral geniculate nucleus. In addition, there is an important expansion of projections from the pulvinar complex to the HC, compared to the controls. These findings show that the functional consequences of congenital blindness need to be considered in terms of both modifications of the interareal cortical network and the ascending visual pathways.",connectivity; deafferentation; hybrid cortex; primate; pulvinar; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; MIDDLE TEMPORAL AREA; BILATERAL ENUCLEATION; CORTICAL AREAS; CONNECTIVITY; ORGANIZATION; PLASTICITY; PULVINAR; MONKEY; SPECIFICATION

Some degree of pathway specificity in the utilization of synaptic zinc has been reported in rodents. Here, we use focal injections of the retrograde tracer sodium selenite to identify zinc-positive (Zn+) projection neurons in the monkey ventral visual pathway. After injections in V1, V4, and TEO areas, neurons were detected preferentially in several feedback pathways but, unusually, were restricted to deeper layers without involvement of layers 2 or 3. Temporal injections resulted in more extensive labeling of both feedback and intratemporal association pathways. The Zn+ neurons had a broader laminar distribution, similar to results from standard retrograde tracers. After anterograde tracer injection in area posterior TE, electron microscopic analysis substantiated that a proportion of feedback synapses was colabeled with zinc. Nearby injections, Zn+ intrinsic neurons concentrated in layer 2, but in temporal areas were also abundant in layer 6. These results indicate considerable pathway and laminar specificity as to which cortical neurons use synaptic zinc. Given the hypothesized roles of synaptic zinc, this is likely to result in distinct synaptic properties, possibly including differential synaptic plasticity within or across projections.",feedback; feedforward; subpopulations of pyramidal neurons; ventral visual pathway; zinc; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL NETWORKS; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL SULCUS; PARAHIPPOCAMPAL CORTICES; INFEROTEMPORAL CORTEX; ZINCERGIC NEURONS; BARREL CORTEX; THALAMOCORTICAL SYNAPSES; DIFFERENTIAL CONNECTIONS; INTRINSIC CONNECTIONS

The present experiments use both anterograde and retrograde tracing techniques to characterize the connections of Rgb. The main cortical projections from Rgb are to the caudal part of the anterior cingulate cortex, area 18b, retrosplenial granular a cortex (Rga), and postsubiculum, and less dense terminal fields are present in the prelimbic and caudal occipital cortices. The major subcortical projections are to the anterior thalamic nuclei and the rostral pontine nuclei, and very small terminal fields are present in the caudal dorsomedial part of the striatum, the reuniens and reticular nuclei of the thalamus, and the mammillary bodies. Contralaterally, Rgb primarily projects to itself, i.e., hornotypically, and more sparsely projects to Rga and postsubiculum. In general, the axons from Rgb terminate ipsilaterally in cortical layers I and III-V and contralaterally in layer V, with a smaller number of terminals in layers I and VI. Thalamic projections from Rgb target the anteroventral and laterodorsal nuclei of the thalamus, with only a few axons terminating in the anterodorsal nucleus, the reticular nucleus, and the nucleus reuniens of the thalamus. Rgb is innervated by the anterior cingulate cortex, precentral agranular cortex, cortical area 18b, dorsal subiculum, and postsubiculum. Subcortical projections to Rgb originate mainly in the claustrum, the horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca, and the anterior thalamic nuclei. These data demonstrate that, in the rat, Rgb is a major nodal point for the integration and subsequent distribution of information to and from the hippocampal formation, the midline limbic and visual cortices, and the thalamus. Thus, similarly to the entorhinal cortex, Rgb in the rat is a prominent gateway for information exchange between the hippocampal formation and other limbic areas of the brain.",anterior thalamic nuclei; cingulate cortex; hippocampus; limbic system; Papez circuit; ANTERIOR THALAMIC NUCLEI; CINGULATE CORTICAL-LESIONS; HEAD-DIRECTION CELLS; SPATIAL MEMORY; RHESUS-MONKEY; EFFERENT CONNECTIONS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; EPISODIC MEMORY; HIPPOCAMPAL-FORMATION; LATERODORSAL NUCLEUS

Following tritiated amino acid injections into the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) and WGA-HRP injections into the contralateral cerebellar nuclei, we found that the nigrothalamic and cerebellothalamic afferents distribute to three main targets: the central portion of the ventral anterior nucleus (VA) and the ventral lateral nucleus (VL), the internal medullary lamina (IML) region, which includes the paralaminar VA, the mediodorsal nucleus (MD) and the central lateral nucleus (CL), and finally the ventromedial nucleus (VM). We observed three distribution patterns of labeled fibers: a) Dense single label was observed in the central portion of VA following the SNr injections and in VL following the cerebellar nuclei injections. b) A complementary pattern consisting of alternating foci of nigral and cerebellar label was found in the IML region. This pattern was also observed in the caudal intralaminar nuclei where cerebellar label predominated in the centrum medianum (CM), while the parafascicular nucleus (Pf) primarily contained nigral label. c) An overlapping pattern of autoradiographic and WGA-HRP label was found in the lateral half of the VM. Overall, the distribution of nigrothalamic and cerebellothalamic projections was widespread throughout much of rostrocaudal thalamus. However, the pattern of projections varied along a continuum from lateral to medial thalamus. In lateral thalamus, nigral and cerebellar projections distributed to separate nuclei while in medial thalamus, the projection pattern changed to focal and complementary in the IML and overlapping in VM. Taken together, these thalamic projections may constitute crucial links in different functional channels involved in alerting and orienting mechanisms associated with motor behavior. Our findings also suggest that the organization of motor thalamic afferents in the dog shares similarities with the segregated and parallel circuitry characteristic of primates as well as with the overlapping and converging circuits of rodents and other carnivores.",AUTORADIOGRAPHY; CEREBELLUM; MOTOR THALAMUS; SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; VENTROMEDIAL THALAMIC NUCLEUS; NIGRA PARS RETICULATA; ROSTRAL BRAIN-STEM; SUBSTANTIA NIGRA; TOPOGRAPHICAL ORGANIZATION; CEREBELLAR PROJECTIONS; MACACA-MULATTA; RHESUS-MONKEY; SPATIAL RELATIONSHIPS; EFFERENT CONNECTIONS

Previous PET S1R radiotracers are characterized by slow kinetics or off-target binding that impedes their use in humans. Here, we report the first PET imaging evaluation in rhesus monkeys of 4 F-18-labeled spirocyclic piperidine-based PET radiotracers (F-18-1 to F-18-4). Methods: Baseline scans for the 4 radiotracers were obtained on an adult male rhesus monkey. Blocking scans were obtained with the S1R-selective agonist SA4503 to assess binding specificity of F-18-2 and F-18-4. Arterial input functions were measured, and binding parameters were determined with kinetic modeling analysis. Results: In the rhesus brain, all 4 radiotracers showed high and fast uptake. Tissue activity washout was rapid for F-18-2 and F-18-4, and much slower for F-18-1 and F-18-3, in line with their respective in vitro S1R-binding affinities. Both the 1-tissue-compartment and multilinear analysis-1 kinetic models provided good fits of time-activity curves and reliable estimates of distribution volume. Regional distribution volume values were highest in the cingulate cortex and lowest in the thalamus for all radiotracers. F-18-4 showed greater differential uptake across brain regions and 3-fold-higher binding potential than F-18-2. SA4503 at the dose of 0.5 mg/kg blocked approximately 85% (F-18-2) and 95% (F-18-4) of radiotracer binding. Conclusion: Tracers F-18-2 and F-18-4 displayed high brain uptake and fast tissue kinetics, with F-18-4 having higher specific binding signals than F-18-2 in the same monkey. Taken together, these data indicate that both F-18-2 and F-18-4 possess the requisite kinetic and imaging properties as viable PET tracers for imaging S1R in the human brain.",sigma-1 receptor; PET; radioligand; F-18; rhesus monkey; RECEPTOR LIGANDS; BINDING; RADIOLIGAND; BRAIN; TOMOGRAPHY; NEUROSTEROIDS; DERIVATIVES; SA4503; MICE

In each of these three domains the rodent model exhibits striking similarities to humans. We hypothesize that there is a specific thalamo-cortical-basal ganglia network that subserves spatial attentional functions. Key components of this network are medial agranular and posterior parietal cortex, dorsocentral striatum, and the lateral posterior thalamic nucleus. Several issues need to be addressed before we can hope to realistically understand or model the functions of this networks Among these are the roles of medial versus lateral posterior parietal cortex; cholinergic mechanisms in attention; interhemispheric interactions; the role of synchronous firing at the cortical, striatal, and thalamic levels; interactions between cortical and thalamic projections to the striatum; interactions between cortical and nigral inputs to the thalamus; the role of collicular inputs to the lateral posterior thalamic nucleus; the role of cerebral cortex versus superior colliculus in driving the motor output expressed as orienting behavior during directed attention; the extent to which the circuitry we describe for directed attention also plays a role in other forms of attention.

According to their model, core auditory cortex receives predominantly unimodal sensory input from the ventral nucleus of the medial geniculate body (MGBv); whereas belt cortex receives predominantly cross-modal sensory input from nuclei outside the MGBv. We previously characterized distinct response properties in rat primary (A1) versus ventral auditory field (VAF) cortex; however, it has been unclear whether VAF should be categorized as a core or belt auditory cortex. The current study employed high-resolution functional imaging to map intrinsic metabolic responses to tones and to guide retrograde tracer injections into A1 and VAF. The size and density of retrogradely labeled somas in the medial geniculate body (MGB) were examined as a function of their position along the caudal-to-rostral axis, subdivision of origin, and cortical projection target. A1 and VAF projecting neurons were found in the same subdivisions of the MGB but in rostral and caudal parts, respectively. Less than 3% of the cells projected to both regions. VAF projecting neurons were smaller than A1 projecting neurons located in dorsal (MGBd) and suprageniculate (SG) nuclei. Thus, soma size varied with both caudal-rostral position and cortical target. Finally, the majority (>70%) of A1 and VAF projecting neurons were located in MGBv.

In addition, portions of the sensory nucleus ventralis posterior lateralis, pars caudalis (VPLc) were explored. Isolated neurons were examined for their responses to somatosensory examination and active movement (n = 919) and for their response to torque-induced joint displacements ( n = 375). A total of 684 neurons was determined histologically to lie within specific subnuclei of the motor (n = 574) or sensory (n = 110) thalamus. The sensorimotor response properties of neurons in the thalamic subnuclei showed clear differences in their response to somatosensory examination. In order of decreasing frequency, the percent of neurons responding to passive somatosensory examination in each subnucleus were as follows: VPLc, 96% (106/110), VPLo, 93% (252/270), VLc, 77% (43/56), VLo, 37% (59/155), Area X, 22%( 12/53), and VA, 12% (5/40). Conversely, neurons that responded only to active movement were most frequent in VLo, 44% (68/155), VA, 45% (18/40), and Area X, 40% (21/53) and relatively infrequent in VLc 11% (6/56) and VPLo, 3% (7/270). In VPLc, no neurons were found that responded only to active movement (0/110). A well-defined somatotopic organization was found in VLo, VPLo, and VPLc and was suggested strongly for VLc. Individual body regions were represented in a series of lamellae, organized in a partial onion skin-like arrangement with the leg represented in the outermost lamella, and the trunk, arm, and orofacial regions represented in successively deeper lamellae. In general the body representations, although present for each subnucleus thoroughly examined, i.e., VLo, VPLo, and VPLc, also were contiguous across subnuclei. Based on the available data, a clear somatotopic picture could not be discerned for Area X or VA. Responses to torque application were more common in neurons in VPLo (77%; 60/78) and VLc (73%; 16/22) than in VLo (44%; 12/27). Mean latencies were shortest for neurons in VPLo (25 +/- 14 ms; mean +/- SD) and the bordering (shell) region of VPLc (22 +/- 15 ms) and were approximately twice as long in VLc (51 +/- 23 ms) and VLo (47 +/- 21 ms). Short-latency (<20 ms) responses to torque application were found for a large proportion of cells in VPLo (45%; 27/60). These neurons were located largely in the lateral portions of ventro-caudal VPLo. The presence of short-latency torque responses in this portion of VPLo suggests that this region may act as a direct relay for proprioceptive information from the periphery to the motor cortex because this area of VPLo has been demonstrated to project directly to the motor cortex. Although mean firing frequencies for VPLo (22 +/- 11 Hz) were different from other subnuclei within the motor thalamus (12 +/- 8, 13 +/- 8, 15 +/- 8, and 12 +/- 8 Hz for VLc, VLo, VA, and Area X, respectively), there was a wide distribution of average rates with significant overlap between subnuclei. Mean firing frequencies in VPLc (26 +/- 8 Hz) were similar to those in VPLo. This study is the first physiological study to demonstrate a detailed somatotopy in both basal ganglia (VLo) and cerebellar (VPLo and VLc) receiving areas of the thalamus and to identify and localize neurons with short-latency responses to kinesthetic stimuli in the posterolateral portions of VPLo.",nan; VENTRALIS INTERMEDIUS NEURONS; MONKEY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; LATENCY PERIPHERAL INPUTS; DORSAL COLUMN INPUT; MACACA-MULATTA; CAT THALAMUS; SINGLE CELL; VL NEURONS; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; CEREBELLAR PROJECTIONS

Preferred directions are influenced by visual cues as well as idiothetic self-motion cues derived from vestibular, proprioceptive, motor efferent copy, and command signals. To distinguish the relative importance of active locomotor signals, we compared HD cell response properties in 49 anterodorsal thalamic HD cells of six male Long-Evans rats during active displacements in a foraging task as well as during passive rotations. Since thalamic HD cells typically stop firing if the animals are tightly restrained, the rats were trained to remain immobile while drinking water distributed at intervals from a small reservoir at the center of a rotatable platform. The platform was rotated in a clockwise/counterclockwise oscillation to record directional responses in the stationary animals while the surrounding environmental cues remained stable. The peak rate of directional firing decreased by 27% on average during passive rotations (r(2) = 0.73, P < 0.001). Individual cells recorded in sequential sessions (n = 8) reliably showed comparable reductions in peak firing, but simultaneously recorded cells did not necessarily produce identical responses. All of the HD cells maintained the same preferred directions during passive rotations. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that the level of locomotor activity provides a state-dependent modulation of the response magnitude of AD HD cells. This could result from diffusely projecting neuromodulatory systems associated with motor state.",nan; WHOLE-BODY ROTATIONS; FREELY MOVING RATS; ANTERIOR THALAMUS; NUCLEUS; NEURONS; POSTSUBICULUM; CORTEX; CUES; PROJECTIONS; DEPENDENCE

Cat areas 17, 18, and 19 can be equated with macaque areas V1, V2, and V3, respectively, based on criteria of relative position in the cortical mantle, internal organization of visual field representations, and trans- and subcortical connections. Using these same criteria, a visual area on the medial bank of the lateral suprasylvian sulcus (area PMLS) in the cat can be equated with macaque area V5. The equivalences are supported by data on neuronal receptive field properties and the contributions the areas make to visual behavior. Although the data are scanty for most other visual areas, there are enough data tentatively to equate collectively cat areas 20a and 20b with macaque areas TF and TH and to liken cat areas 21a and 21b with macaque area V4. What is not clear is if there is a region in cat that is equivalent to area TE in the macaque monkey. If there is, it likely lies on the banks of the posterior suprasylvian sulcus between areas 20 and 21 and the polysensory cortex of the posterior ectosylvian gyrus. Knowledge gained from prior research on macaque areas V4 and TE can be used to formulate specific additional investigations of cat area 21 and the uncharted posterior suprasylvian sulcus. In addition, prior investigations carried out on cat area 20 can be used to devise specific explorations of macaque areas TF and TH.",nan; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL SULCUS; RECEPTIVE-FIELD PROPERTIES; LATERAL SUPRASYLVIAN AREA; POSTERIOR-PULVINAR COMPLEX; SINGLE-CELL PROPERTIES; ADJACENT THALAMIC NUCLEI; REVERSIBLE COLD LESIONS; STRIATE CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; DIRECTION SELECTIVITY

Inflammatory changes in brain could underlie this injury. Here, we evaluated whether neuroinflammation is induced by chorioamnionitis in a clinically relevant model. Methods: Rhesus macaque fetuses were exposed to either intra-amniotic (IA) saline, or IA lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (1 mg) 16 or 48 h prior to delivery at 130 days (85 % of gestation) (n = 4-5 animals/group). We measured cytokines in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), froze samples from the left brain for molecular analysis, and immersion fixed the right brain hemisphere for immunohistology. We analyzed the messenger RNA (mRNA) levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1 beta, CCL2, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and COX-2 in the periventricular white matter (PVWM), cortex, thalamus, hippocampus, and cerebellum by RT-qPCR. Brain injury was assessed by immunohistology for myelin basic protein (MBP), IBA1 (microglial marker), GFAP (astrocyte marker), OLIG2 (oligodendrocyte marker), NeuN (neuronal marker), CD3 (T cells), and CD14 (monocytes). Microglial proliferation was assessed by co-immunostaining for IBA1 and Ki67. Data were analyzed by ANOVA with Tukey's post-test. Results: IA LPS increased mRNA expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the PVWM, thalamus, and cerebellum, increased IL-6 concentration in the CSF, and increased apoptosis in the periventricular area after 16 h. Microglial proliferation in the white matter was increased 48 h after IA LPS. Conclusions: LPS-induced chorioamnionitis caused neuroinflammation, microglial proliferation, and periventricular apoptosis in a clinically relevant model of chorioamnionitis in fetal rhesus macaques. These findings identify specific responses in the fetal brain and support the hypothesis that neuroinflammatory changes may mediate the adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes associated with chorioamnionitis.",Chorioamnionitis; Prematurity; Brain injury; Periventricular leukomalacia; Cytokines; Microglia; Apoptosis; WHITE-MATTER INJURY; PERIVENTRICULAR LEUKOMALACIA; BRAIN-INJURY; HISTOLOGICAL CHORIOAMNIONITIS; PREMATURE-INFANT; GESTATIONAL-AGE; CEREBRAL-PALSY; GRAY-MATTER; INFECTION; BIRTH

We determined regional brain (basal ganglia, thalamus, and frontal cortex) immune and virological profiles at 7 and 14 days post infection (dpi) with SIVmac239 in rhesus macaques. The basal ganglia and thalamus had detectable viruses earlier (7 dpi) than the frontal cortex (14 dpi) and contained higher quantities of viruses than the latter. Increased immune activation of astrocytes and significant infiltration of macrophages in the thalamus at 14 dpi coincided with elevated plasma viral load, and SIV colocalized only within macrophages. RNA signatures of proinflammatory responses, including IL-6, were detected at 7 dpi in microglia and interestingly, preceded reliable detection of virus in tissues and were maintained in the chronically infected macaques. Countering the proinflammatory response, the antiinflammatory response was not detected until increased TGF-beta expression was found in perivascular macrophages at 14 dpi. But this response was not detected in chronic infection. Our data provide evidence that the interplay of acute proinflammatory and antiinflammatory responses in the brain likely contributed to the overt neuroinflammation, where the immune activation preceded reliable viral detection.",nan; SIMIAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; CD8(+) T-CELLS; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; MOLECULAR CLONES; HIV; PHOSPHORYLATION; SIVMAC239; RESERVOIR; GENES

Using in situ hybridization, we examine the distribution pattern of both GAD mRNAs in the hypothalamus and thalamus of prepubertal and adult male rhesus macaques. Qualitatively, GAD(65) and GAD(67) mRNAs showed a similar wide, but highly specific distribution pattern, supporting the view that GABAergic neurons play an important role in modulating neuroendocrine function. However, no quantitative difference in the intensity of hybridization signal was detected between prepubertal and adult animals in any of the hypothalamic or thalamic nuclei. Therefore, although GABAergic neurons are anatomically well-placed to control the secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in primates, it is unlikely that the onset of puberty and the associated increase in GnRH secretion is triggered by a change in GAD gene transcription.

The usual CA-CP system did not appear satisfactory for stereotaxy of the amygdala and anterior hippocampus. Variation studies on ventriculograms and reconstructions from histological material were done to find more reliable systems. The most precise system of coordinates for cartography and stereotaxy of the amygdala is based on the 'amygdalar notch', a ventricular diverticulum forming the angle between the inferior and anterior borders of the temporal horn of the lateral ventricle, located beneath the inferior border of the amygdala. The AN point, the vertex of the notch in the sagittal direction, is a reliable ventricular landmark in the antero-posterior and infero-superior directions. The medial vertex of the diverticulum, ANm, is a ventricular landmark in the medio-lateral direction. The 'AN system of coordinates' is a reliable system for amygdalar stereotaxy. Stereotaxy of the anterior hippocampus would benefit from other ventricular landmarks. The most lateral point of the main body (HiL) is a landmark for the medio-lateral dimension. Ventriculography and ventricular landmarks should always be used for stereotaxy in primate species.

The lateral posterior thalamic nucleus (LP) may also play a role in directed attention and neglect because LP has robust reciprocal connections with these cortical areas and projects to DCS. We used anterograde axonal tracing to map thalamostriatal projections from LP and surrounding thalamic nuclei, with a focus on projections to DCS. The thalamic nuclei investigated included LP, laterodorsal thalamic nucleus (LD), central lateral nucleus (CL), and posterior thalamic nucleus (Po). We found that the mediorostral part of LP (LPMR) projects strongly to DCS as well as to the dorsal peripheral region of the striatum. Further, there is topography within LPMR and DCS such that the far medial LPMR projects to the central region of DCS (projection area of AGm) and the central LPMR projects to the dorsal region of DCS (projection area of PPC and Oc2M). In contrast, the laterorostral part of LP (LPLR) and other thalamic nuclei surrounding LP project to dorsolateral to dorsomedial peripheral regions of the striatum but do not project to DCS. These findings indicate that DCS is a region of convergence for thalamostriatal and corticostriatal projections from regions that are themselves interconnected, serving as the key element of the corticostriatal-thalamic network mediating spatial processing and directed attention.

As expected, all of the neurons in the visual sector were immunoreactive for GAD, the synthesizing enzyme for GABA, but the distribution of SOM-immunoreactive cells was not uniform. It appeared that every cell in the medial tier was immunoreactive for SOM, but that very few cells in the lateral tier contained this neuropeptide.

However, it is unknown whether, and how, these structures are engaged during the observation of actions performed by effectors different from the hand. To address this issue, in the present fMRI study, healthy human participants were required to execute or to observe grasping acts performed with different effectors, namely mouth, hand, and foot. As control, participants executed and observed simple movements performed with the same effectors. The results show that: (1) execution of goal-directed actions elicited somatotopically organized activations not only in the cerebral cortex but also in the cerebellum, basal ganglia, and thalamus; (2) action observation evoked cortical, cerebellar and subcortical activations, lacking a clear somatotopic organization; (3) in the territories displaying shared activations between execution and observation, a rough somatotopy could be revealed in both cortical, cerebellar and subcortical structures. The present study confirms previous findings that action observation, beyond the cerebral cortex, also activates specific sectors of cerebellum and subcortical structures and it shows, for the first time, that these latter are engaged not only during hand actions observation but also during the observation of mouth and foot actions. We suggest that each of the activated structures processes specific aspects of the observed action, such as performing internal simulation (cerebellum) or recruiting/inhibiting the overt execution of the observed action (basal ganglia and sensory-motor thalamus).",Action observation; Mirror neuron system; Somatotopy; fMRI; cerebellum; Basal ganglia; Thalamus; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; SOMATOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; FMRI EVIDENCE; PARIETAL; REPRESENTATION; NEURONS; PREMOTOR; MACAQUE; PERCEPTION; MOVEMENT

One possible underlying pathophysiology is serotonergic dysfunction. In this study, we used an animal model of HIV, the SIV-infected macaque, to longitudinally image serotonin transporter (SERT) expression before and after inoculation, using 11C-DASB (SERT ligand) PET imaging. Methods: We infected seven rhesus macaques with a neurovirulent SIV strain and imaged them at baseline and multiple time points after inoculation (group A). Pyrosequencing methylation analysis of the SERT promoter region was performed. We also measured SERT mRNA/protein in brain single-cell suspensions from another group (group B) of SIV-infected animals (n = 13). Results: Despite some animals showing early fluctuations, 86% of our group A animals eventually showed a net increase in midbrain/thalamus binding potential (BPND) over the course of their disease (mean increased binding between last time point and baseline = 30.2% and 32.2%, respectively). Repeated-measures mixed-model analysis showed infection duration to be predictive of midbrain BPND (p = 0.039). Thalamic BPND was statistically significantly associated with multiple CSF cytokines (P < 0.05). There was higher SERT protein levels in the second group (group B) of SIV-infected animals with SIV encephalitis (SIVE) compared to those without SIVE (p = 0.014). There were no longitudinal changes in SERT gene promoter region percentage methylation between baselines and last time points in group A animals. Conclusion: Upregulated SERT leading to lower synaptic levels of serotonin is a possible mechanism of depression in HIV+ patients, and extrapolating our conclusions from SIV to HIV should be sought using translational human studies.",HIV; SIV; depression; serotonin transporter; PET; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; DNA METHYLATION; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MAJOR DEPRESSION; BINDING DOMAIN; EXPRESSION; BRAIN; VIRUS; GENE

The purpose of this work was to explore the cortical and subcortical mechanisms underlying the execution of voluntary saccadic eye movements in humans. 2. Normalized regional cerebral blood flow (NrCBF) was measured using positron emission tomography (PET) and (H2O)-O-15 bolus intravenous injections in four right-handed healthy volunteers at rest and while performing self-paced voluntary horizontal saccadic eye movements in total darkness. 3. Magnetic resonance imaging of each subject's brain was matched to PET images, allowing the detection of activation in individually defined anatomic regions of interest. Cortical regions were drawn according to gyri limits; subcortical structures were also defined. 4. Self-paced saccadic eye movements elicited bilateral NrCBF increases in the lenticular nuclei, including putamen and globus pallidus, and in the thalamus. At the cortical level, we found bilateral NrCBF increases in the precentral gyrus, the superior part of the median frontal gyrus that corresponds to the supplementary motor area. There was also a significant NrCBF increase in the cerebellar vermis. 5. Right fusiform and lingual gyri, right insula, and left cingulate gyrus were also activated during the execution of saccades. 6.

Compared with previous studies, we observed a more widespread distribution of Met-8 in the human diencephalon. Met-8-immunoreactive cell bodies and fibers exhibited a more widespread distribution in the hypothalamus than in the thalamus. We observed six populations of Met-8immunoreactive cell bodies. These perikarya were observed in the paratenial thalamic nucleus, ventromedial and dorsomedial hypothalamic nuclei, lateral hypothalamic area, pallidohypothalamic nucleus and in the paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (posterior part). In the thalamus, Met-8-immunoreactive fibers were primarily observed in the midline region, whereas in the hypothalamus, these fibers were widely distributed. In general, a moderate/low density of Met-8-immunoreactive fibers was observed in the diencephalic nuclei. A moderate density was observed in the paraventricular thalamic nucleus, reuniens thalamic nucleus, lateral and medial geniculate nuclei, dorsomedial hypothalamic nucleus, paraventricular hypothalamic nucleus (posterior part) and ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus. The present study is the first to demonstrate the presence of clusters of Met-8-immunoreactive cell bodies in the human thalamus and hypothalamus, the distribution of fibers containing neuropeptides in the hypothalamus and the presence of these fibers in several thalamic nuclei. This neuroanatomical study will serve to elucidate the physiological roles of Met -8 in future studies of the human diencephalon. (C) 2016 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The main thalamic projections, which originated in both the magnocellular and parvocellular subdivisions of the mediodorsal nucleus, were topographically organized. Our results suggest the existence of a third, caudal subdivision of this nucleus, which is likely to be homologous to the macaque's pars densocellularis. A substantial, but not topographically organized, projection to Brodmann's area 10 originated in the medial part of the ventral anterior nucleus. Minor thalamic projections originated in the medial pulvinar nucleus and in the midline/intralaminar nuclei. Finally, the posterior thalamic group (including the limitans and suprageniculate nuclei) sent a small projection to rostral area 10 that has not previously been documented in primates. The main extrathalamic projections stemmed from the claustrum, which contained as many as 50% of all subcortical labelled neurons. Minor connections originated in the hypothalamus (mainly in the lateral anterior and lateral tuberal regions), dorsal periaqueductal grey matter, basal forebrain (nucleus basalis of Meynert and horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca), and amygdala (basal, accessory basal and lateral nuclei). The present results, combined with recent data on the cortical projections to area 10, reveal the frontal pole as a region that integrates information from multiple neural processing systems, including high-level sensory, limbic and working memory-related structures. Although the pattern of subcortical projections is similar to that previously described in the macaque, suggesting a homologous organization, the present data also suggest functional distinctions between medial and lateral sectors of area 10.",claustrum; cognition; connectivity; limbic; prefrontal cortex; primate; thalamus; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MIDBRAIN PERIAQUEDUCTAL GRAY; RHESUS-MONKEY; CALLITHRIX-JACCHUS; MACAQUE MONKEY; MEDIODORSAL NUCLEUS; TOPOGRAPHIC ORGANIZATION; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; COMMON MARMOSET

Neurons were counted in this same nucleus, allowing the magnification functions (cells/degree(2) as functions of eccentricity) of magnocellular and parvocellular layers to be determined after eliminating the effects of nonuniform volume shrinkage. Parvocellular magnification was approximately 10,000 times higher in the foveola than in the far periphery. On average, magnocellular neurons made up 2.6% of the LGN in the central 2 degrees (but probably a smaller fraction in the central fovea). The magnocellular portion increased steadily with eccentricity to 27% in the far periphery. Thus the magno/parvo ratio increases from foveola to far periphery by a factor of at least 14. The parvocellular magnification function matches estimates of cortical magnification, whereas the density of magnocellular afferents to cortex increases monotonically with eccentricity. At the posterior pole of the nucleus, the numbers of layers are reduced through a fusion of two layers and the disappearance of one or two others, a feature that may be associated with the foveal ipsilateral hemifield representation.

Behavioural investigation of the effects of these disconnections gives information that cannot be derived either from clinical studies or from the effects of bilateral symmetrical ablations in the monkey. Disconnection experiments are particularly suited to the study of the interactions between the components of widespread cortical networks. We propose that memory acquisition is dependent on plastic cortical changes that are widespread, rather than limited to the medial temporal lobe. Further, memory acquisition depends on cortical-subcortical interactions to a greater extent than memory retrieval does. Prefrontal cortex, we suggest, is specifically important in the representation of temporally complex events. (C) 2008 Elsevier Masson Srl.

In particular, modulatory control of processing in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus, V1, and V2 will alter the outcome of all subsequent processing of visual information, including the extent to and manner in which individual inputs contribute to perception and decision making and are stored in memory. This review addresses five small-molecule neuromodulators-acetylcholine, dopamine, serotonin, no-radrenaline, and histamine-considering the structural basis for their action, and the effects of their release, in the early visual pathway of the macaque monkey. Traditionally, neuromodulators are studied in isolation and in discrete circuits; this review makes a case for considering the joint action of modulatory molecules and differences in modulatory effects across brain areas as a better means of understanding the diverse roles that these molecules serve.",cholinergic; dopaminergic; histaminergic; noradrenergic; norepinephrine; serotonergic; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; LOCUS-COERULEUS; CHOLINERGIC MODULATION; SEROTONERGIC PROJECTIONS; IMMUNOREACTIVE NEURONS; BASAL FOREBRAIN; CORTICAL STATE; GUINEA-PIG; NEW-WORLD; INNERVATION

An animal's ability to adapt behavioral responses according to changes in reward value can be measured using a reinforcer devaluation task, wherein the desirability of a given object is reduced by decreasing the value of the associated food reinforcement. Elements of the neural circuits serving this ability have been studied in both rodents and nonhuman primates. Specifically, the basolateral amygdala, orbitofrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and mediodorsal thalamus have each been shown to play a critical role in the process of value updating, required for adaptive goal selection. As these regions receive dense cholinergic input, we investigated whether systemic injections of nonselective nicotinic or muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists, mecamylamine and scopolamine, respectively, would impair performance on a reinforcer devaluation task. Here we demonstrate that in the presence of either a nicotinic or muscarinic antagonist, animals are able to shift their behavioral responses in an appropriate manner, suggesting that disruption of cholinergic neuromodulation is not sufficient to disrupt value updating, and subsequent goal selection, in rhesus macaques.",Acetylcholine; Nicotinic receptor; Muscarinic receptor; Behavioral flexibility; ORBITAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MEDIODORSAL THALAMIC NUCLEUS; RHESUS-MONKEYS; BASOLATERAL AMYGDALA; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; RECOGNITION MEMORY; BASAL FOREBRAIN; STRATEGY IMPLEMENTATION; TRANSIENT INACTIVATION; HIPPOCAMPAL-LESIONS

Peak dose dyskinesia is a major problem in the treatment of parkinsonian patients with levodopa therapy but this remains the best pharmacological agent for treating the condition. The hypothesis was derived from previous work which has suggested that reduced pallidal inhibition of the thalamus results in dyskinesia [Crossman (1990) Movement Dis. 5, 100-108]. A neuroanatomical tracing study was carried out prior to the thalamotomy work, using the anterograde tracer wheatgerm-agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase. This delineated the anterior part of the ventrolateral thalamus in the primate in terms of its afferent inputs. Wheatgerm agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase was injected into the medial segment of the globus pallidus bilaterally in three Macaca fascicularis and traced to terminals in the ventral thalamus and other brain areas. The appropriate thalamic area involved was plotted on atlas sections in preparation for stereotactic thalamotomy. Previous studies of neuronal input to the ventral thalamus are confusing due to the different nomenclatures used by different workers. Early workers used cytoarchitectonic boundaries which do not correspond with function. There are also differences in nomenclature between man, monkey and other animals. The current study maps the pallidal terminal territory within the thalamus in terms of stereotactic co-ordinates related to a published macaque atlas [Shantha et al. (1968) A Stereotaxic Atlas of the Java Monkey Brain. S. Karger, Basel] and can thus be used by other workers in the field. A well-established primate model of Parkinsonism was used for the thalamotomy study. Eight monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were rendered parkinsonian with 1-methyl-4-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. Regular dosing with levodopa or apomorphine reliably resulted in peak-dose dyskinesia which was scored in terms of its choreic and dystonic components. A radiofrequency electrode was used to create the ablative lesions. Chorea was always reduced and frequently abolished by a thalamotomy located in the pallidal terminal territory. This result was obtained after 10 thalamotomies in a total of six animals. Four animals received bilateral lesions, with an interval between operations and two animals underwent unilateral surgery. Lesions which were positioned medial to the pallidal terminal territory (n = 3) had no permanent effect upon chorea. Lesions were also made in the thalamic areas which receive cerebellar and nigral inputs and in other areas which receive input from the medial segment of the globus pallidus, including the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus, the substantia nigra pars reticulata and the pedunculopontine nucleus. None of these lesions had a significant effect upon peak-dose chorea. In contrast to the dramatic effects upon chorea, peak-dose dystonia was not affected by any of the thalamic lesions. The data suggest that: (i) levodopa-induced chorea can be alleviated by a thalamotomy in the pallidal terminal territory of the thalamus and (ii) chorea and dystonia are mediated by different pathophysiological circuits.",nan; LATERAL THALAMIC REGION; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; PARS COMPACTA; BASAL GANGLIA; NEURONS; PROJECTIONS; RAT; HRP; MECHANISMS; RETROGRADE

On the basis of a systematic series of tritiated amino acid injections into different portions of the substantia nigra, we found that the rostral three-fourths of the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) gives rise to widespread thalamic projections. The nigrothalamic label occupied a longitudinal band extending from rostral ventral anterior nucleus (VA) through to caudal mediodorsal nucleus (MD). In the dog, VA is histochemically identified as an acetylthiocholinesterase (AChE)-negative region and is distinct from the adjacent ventral lateral nuclei which stain positively for AChE. In rostral thalamus, the dense autoradiographic label was observed in rostral VA within the AchE-negative region lying alongside the mammillothalamic tract (MT). The adjacent AChE-positive ventral lateral nuclei did not contain autoradiographic label. In addition, homogeneously distributed silver grains were observed throughout the ventromedial nucleus (VM) bilaterally. More caudally, as the ventral lateral thalamic compartment emerges, label was also observed within the internal medullary lamina region, including the paralaminar portion of VA, the central lateral nucleus (CL), and the paralaminar portion of MD. Finally, in caudal thalamus, the central portion of MD, as well as the parafascicular nucleus (Pf), contained autoradiographic label. The overall nigrothalamic distribution observed in the dog was similar to the distribution of nigrothalamic projections in monkeys with one exception. Unlike that of primates, the distribution of nigral efferents is to the whole extent of VM in the dog as in other non-primate species. Overall, we found that nigral efferents primarily project to three main thalamic targets: the VA/MD region, VM, and the internal medullary lamina region, which includes dorsal CL and paralaminar VA and MD. We propose that these three nigrothalamic territories may constitute critical links subserving different functional channels.","AUTORADIOGRAPHY; THALAMUS, SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; BASAL GANGLIA; VENTROMEDIAL THALAMIC NUCLEUS; VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; NIGRA PARS RETICULATA; SUBSTANTIA NIGRA; BASAL GANGLIA; TOPOGRAPHICAL ORGANIZATION; EFFERENT CONNECTIONS; VISUOMOTOR FUNCTIONS; RHESUS-MONKEY; CAT"

The present study was undertaken in the context of surgical treatment of motor disorders such as essential tremor (ET) and Parkinson's disease (PD) to precisely determine the course and three-dimensional stereotactic localisation of the cerebellothalamic and pallidothalamic tracts in the human brain. The course of the fibre tracts to the thalamus was traced in the subthalamic region using multiple staining procedures and their entrance into the thalamus determined according to our atlas of the human thalamus and basal ganglia [Morel (2007) Stereotactic atlas of the human thalamus and basal ganglia. Informa Healthcare Inc., New York]. Stereotactic three-dimensional coordinates were determined by sectioning thalamic and basal ganglia blocks parallel to stereotactic planes and, in two cases, by correlation with magnetic resonance images (MRI) from the same brains prior to sectioning. The major contributions of this study are to provide: (1) evidence that the bulks of the cerebellothalamic and pallidothalamic tracts are clearly separated up to their thalamic entrance, (2) stereotactic maps of the two tracts in the subthalamic region, (3) the possibility to discriminate between different subthalamic fibre tracts on the basis of immunohistochemical stainings, (4) correlations of histologically identified fibre tracts with high-resolution MRI, and (5) evaluation of the interindividual variability of the fibre systems in the subthalamic region. This study should provide an important basis for accurate stereotactic neurosurgical targeting of the subthalamic region in motor disorders such as PD and ET.",basal ganglia; thalamus; motor disorders; essential tremor; Parkinson's disease; DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; PRIMATE MOTOR THALAMUS; MICROELECTRODE-GUIDED PALLIDOTOMY; INTERNAL GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; SINGLE-UNIT ANALYSIS; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; BASAL GANGLIA; MACAQUE MONKEY; THALAMOCORTICAL NEURONS

In the contralateral hemisphere injections of the same tracer involving the full cortical depth were made in homotopical locations, and the distribution and soma size of retrogradely labeled thalamocortical neurons in each side of the thalamus were compared. It was found that, in the cat, labeled neurons in the lateral posterior-pulvinar complex, and in paralaminar regions of the ventrolateral complex, were fewer in number and smaller in size in cases of superficial deposits than in cases of deep injection. In more lateral portions of the ventrolateral complex, however, there were no size differences. In the monkey, similar differences in number and size appeared in the caudal division of the ventrolateral complex and in the lateral posterior and pulvinar nuclei, whereas no such differences were found for neurons labeled in the oral and medial divisions of the ventrolateral complex, and in the ventral posteroinferior nucleus. In all cases the intralaminar and midline nuclei exhibited retrogradely labeled neurons only when deep layers were injected. These and previous findings point to the existence of a widely distributed layer I-projecting system of neurons which, in most nuclei, are interspersed among neurons projecting mainly to middle or deep layers. In some nuclei, however, as is the case with the ventromedial nucleus proper, layer I-projecting system neurons would make up the whole nucleus. The cell groups located in a paralaminar position, which would be but a part of this system, could provide through their projections to layer I in the posterior parietal and frontal cortical regions a final path for recruiting responses and spontaneous spindling activities.",nan; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; STRIATE CORTEX; CORTICAL PROJECTIONS; AFFERENT CONNECTIONS; TOPOGRAPHICAL ORGANIZATION; EFFERENT CONNECTIONS; LAMINAR ORGANIZATION; INTRALAMINAR NUCLEI; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; RHESUS-MONKEY

The study includes descriptions of some of the major cortical influences on sensory and motor circuits subserving vision, hearing and proprioception, as well as movements of the eyes, head and limbs. It also describes the detailed anatomy of the red nucleus in the monkey, and highlights species differences in this structure. It also postulates that cortical projections to the parvicellular component of the red nucleus provide a recurrent loop returning via the thalamus to the motor cortex. The findings reported in this paper helped to substantiate Kuypers' new theory on the organisation of the descending motor pathways by showing that the primary motor cortex, as well as providing a direct crossed corticospinal input to spinal circuits controlling movements of the distal extremities (hand and foot), also influenced these same circuits through ipsilateral projections to the cells of origin of the rubrospinal tract. In contrast, projections from more rostra] motor, premotor and prefrontal regions terminated bilaterally in the parvicellular red nucleus, and influenced ventromedial descending pathways controlling movements of the head, neck, trunk and proximal limbs. The paper has proved of lasting value to our understanding of sensorimotor control and the contribution of different pathways to it.

Rats were given saline or muscimol infusions into the MATN contralateral to the trained eye before each of four conditioning sessions with an auditory CS. Rats were then given four additional sessions without infusions to assess savings from the initial training. All rats were then given a retention test with a muscimol infusion followed by a recovery session. Muscimol infusions through cannula placements within 0.5 mm of the MGm prevented acquisition of eyeblink conditioned responses (CRs) and also blocked CR retention. Cannula placements more than 0.5 mm from the MATN did not completely block CR acquisition and had a partial effect on CR retention. The primary and secondary effects of MATN inactivation were examined with 2-deoxy-glucose (2-DG) autoradiography. Differences in 2-DG uptake in the auditory thalamus were consistent with the cannula placements and behavioral results. Differences in 2-DG uptake were found between groups in the ipsilateral auditory cortex, basilar pontine nuclei, and inferior colliculus. Results from this experiment indicate that the MATN contralateral to the trained eye and its projection to the pontine nuclei are necessary for acquisition and retention of eyeblink CRs to an auditory CS.",nan; NICTITATING-MEMBRANE RESPONSE; RABBITS ORYCTOLAGUS-CUNICULUS; RECEPTIVE-FIELD PLASTICITY; LATERAL RETICULAR NUCLEUS; GENICULATE-BODY; PONTINE NUCLEI; INTERPOSITUS NUCLEUS; INFERIOR COLLICULUS; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; RHESUS-MONKEY

The thalamic input to these two subregions was studied and quantified to gain more information about the influence of the cerebellum and basal ganglia on the oculomotor control mechanisms of the cerebral cortex. A recent study using transneuronal transport of virus demonstrated that there are neurons in the basal ganglia and cerebellum that project to the FEFsac with only a single intervening synapse (Lynch et al., 1994). In the present study, we concentrated on the thalamic input to the FEFsem to define possible basal ganglia-thalamus-cortex and cerebellum-thalamus-cortex channels of information flow to the FEFsem. We localized the functional subregions using low threshold microstimulation, and retrogradely transported fluorescent tracers were then placed into the FEFsem and FEFsac. The neurons that project to the FEFsem are distributed in (1) the rostral portion of the ventral lateral nucleus, pars caudalis, (2) the caudal portion of the ventral lateral nucleus, pars caudalis, (3) the mediodorsal nucleus, (4) the ventral anterior nucleus, pars parvocellularis, and (5) the ventral anterior nucleus, pars magnocellularis. In contrast, the large majority of neurons that project to the FEFsac are located in the paralaminar region of the mediodorsal nucleus. The FEFsac and FEFsem thus each receive neural input from both basal ganglia-receiving and cerebellar-receiving cell groups in the thalamus, but each receives input from a unique combination of thalamic nuclei.",pursuit eye movements; saccades; basal ganglia; substantia nigra; cerebellum; frontal eye field; supplementary eye field; thalamus; Cebus monkeys; NIGRA PARS RETICULATA; LOCAL DOPAMINE DEPLETION; RHESUS-MONKEY; SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; BASAL GANGLIA; OCULOMOTOR FUNCTIONS; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; HUNTINGTONS-DISEASE; MACAQUE MONKEY; MACACA-MULATTA

To explore how temporal dynamics and directional tuning are sculpted in hierarchical vestibular circuits, we compared responses of macaque otolith afferents with neurons in the vestibular and cerebellar nuclei, as well as five cortical areas, to identical three-dimensional translational motion. We demonstrate a remarkable spatio-temporal transformation: otolith afferents carry spatially aligned cosine-tuned translational acceleration and jerk signals. In contrast, brainstem and cerebellar neurons exhibit non-linear, mixed selectivity for translational velocity, acceleration, jerk and position. Furthermore, these components often show dissimilar spatial tuning. Moderate further transformation of translation signals occurs in the cortex, such that similar spatio-temporal properties are found in multiple cortical areas. These results suggest that the first synapse represents a key processing element in vestibular pathways, robustly shaping how self-motion is represented in central vestibular circuits and cortical areas.",nan; VENTRAL INTRAPARIETAL AREA; CHOICE-RELATED ACTIVITY; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL AREA; LINEAR ACCELERATION; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; SELF-MOTION; HEADING PERCEPTION; NERVE AFFERENTS; UTRICULAR AFFERENTS; RESPONSE PROPERTIES

Here we describe the organization of the somatosensory system in a 6-year-old monkey (Macaca radiata) born with a deformed left foot in comparison to the results from a normal monkey (Macaca fascicularis). Toes 1, 3, and 5 were missing, but the proximal parts of toes 2 and 4 were present. We used anatomical tracers to characterize the patterns of peripheral input to the spinal cord and brainstem, as well as between thalamus and cortex. We also determined the somatotopic organization of primary somatosensory area 3b of both hemispheres using multiunit electrophysiological recording. Tracers were subcutaneously injected into matching locations of each foot to reveal their representations within the lumbar spinal cord, and the gracile nucleus (GrN) of the brainstem. Tracers injected into the representations of the toes and plantar pads of cortical area 3b labeled neurons in the ventroposterior lateral nucleus (VPL) of the thalamus. Contrary to the orderly arrangement of the foot representation throughout the lemniscal pathway in the normal monkey, the plantar representation of the deformed foot was significantly expanded and intruded into the expected representations of toes in the spinal cord, GrN, VPL, and area 3b. We also observed abnormal representation of the intact foot in the ipsilateral spinal cord and contralateral area 3b.

A novel single-cell staining procedure performed in vivo under electrophysiological control: morpho-functional features of juxtacellularly labeled thalamic cells and other central neurons with biocytin or neurobiotin. J Neurosci Meth 1996;65:113-36], which allows us to functionally characterize and subsequently label single neurons in vivo in macaque VI. The method is generally applicable in acute in vivo preparations. Extracellular recording is made with a patch electrode when the electrode is attached to the cell membrane. Initially a 'blind' search method is used as a guide to obtaining a cell attached configuration that we refer to as a loose-patch (LP). The neuron's receptive field properties are functionally characterized, the neuron is labeled and then characterization is confirmed, all in the LP configuration. There are a number of advantages of the method that we describe over other methods. First, we have found that we can obtain stable extracellular recordings for periods of hours that enable us to make a relatively comprehensive visual functional characterization of a neuron's receptive field properties. Second, because the electrode is closely apposed to the cell we obtain excellent isolation of the extracellular spike. Third, the method provides labeling that gives complete dendritic and axonal filling that survives over a number of days, which is an important feature in acute primate experiments. Fourth, the in vivo method of labeling and reconstructing neurons gives complete three-dimensional structure of the neuron including its intra-cortical axonal arbor. These features overcome known limits of the established methods of studying neuronal morphology including the Golgi stain (limited when adult tissue is used) and in vitro whole cell methods (incomplete axonal filling due to limited slice thickness). They also overcome the known limits of the established method of combined function-morphology studies i.e. intracellular recording in vivo. The modified juxtacellular method provides a reliable alternative to the difficult method of characterization by extracellular recording and subsequent intracellular labeling [Anderson JC, Martin KAC, Whitteridge D. Form, function and intracortical projections of neurons in the striate cortex of the monkey Macacus nemestrinus. Cerebral Cortex 1993;3:412-20]. We show the method can be used to record at a range of depths through V 1 cortex allowing for sampling of neurons in the different layers and functional subpopulations. Links can then be made with existing knowledge about the anatomical organization of V I, the various morphological classes of neurons found therein, their functional connectivity and visual response properties.

The responses of neurons in this area are not critically dependent on inputs from the primary visual cortex (VC), as lesions of VC leave neuronal response properties in PMLS relatively unchanged (Spear & Baumann, 1979; Spear, 1988; Guido et al., 1990b). However, previous studies have used a limited range of visual stimuli. In this study, we assessed whether neurons in PMLS cortex remained direction-selective to complex motion stimuli following a lesion of VC, particularly to complex random dot kinematograms (RDKs). Unilateral aspiration of VC was performed on post-natal days 7-9. Single unit extracellular recordings were performed one year later in the ipsilateral PMLS cortex. As in previous studies, a reduction in the percentage of direction selective neurons was observed with drifting sinewave gratings. We report a previously unobserved phenomenon with sinewave gratings, in which there is a greater modulation of firing rate at the temporal frequency of the stimulus in animals with a lesion of VC, suggesting an increased segregation of ON and OFF sub-regions. A significant portion of neurons in PMLS cortex were direction selective to simple (16/18) and complex (11/16) RDKs. However, the strength of direction selectivity to both stimuli was reduced as compared to normals. The data suggest that complex motion processing is still present, albeit reduced, in PMLS cortex despite the removal of VC input. The complex RDK motion selectivity is consistent with both geniculo-cortical and extra-geniculate thalamo-cortical pathways in residual direction encoding.",electrophysiology; neuronal reorganization; thalamo-cortical loops; cortico-cortical connectivity; plasticity; LATERAL SUPRASYLVIAN CORTEX; POSTERIOR-PULVINAR COMPLEX; MIDDLE TEMPORAL AREA; NEW-WORLD MONKEYS; STRIATE CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; RESPONSE PROPERTIES; GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; EXTRASTRIATE CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL COMPENSATION

In this study, we examined the extent and anatomical organization of cerebellar input to multiple regions of prefrontal cortex. We first used conventional retrograde tracers to map the origin of thalamic projections to five prefrontal regions: medial area 9 (9m), lateral area 9 (9l), dorsal area 46 (46d), ventral area 46, and lateral area 12. Only areas 46d, 9m, and 9l received substantial input from thalamic regions included within the zone of termination of cerebellar efferents. This suggested that these cortical areas were the target of cerebellar output. We tested this possibility using retrograde transneuronal transport of the McIntyre-B strain of herpes simplex virus type 1 from areas of prefrontal cortex. Neurons labeled by retrograde transneuronal transport of virus were found in the dentate nucleus only after injections into areas 46d, 9m, and 9l. The precise location of labeled neurons in the dentate varied with the prefrontal area injected. In addition, the dentate neurons labeled after virus injections into prefrontal areas were located in regions spatially separate from those labeled after virus injections into motor areas of the cerebral cortex. Our observations indicate that the cerebellum influences several areas of prefrontal cortex via the thalamus. Furthermore, separate output channels exist in the dentate to influence motor and cognitive operations. These results provide an anatomical substrate for the cerebellum to be involved in cognitive functions such as planning, working memory, and rule-based learning.",prefrontal cortex; cerebellum; thalamus; dentate nucleus; transneuronal transport; herpes simplex virus; primate; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; HERPES-SIMPLEX-VIRUS; FRONTAL ASSOCIATION CORTEX; MONKEY MACACA-FASCICULARIS; RHESUS-MONKEY; BASAL GANGLIA; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; TRANSNEURONAL TRANSPORT; THALAMIC PROJECTIONS; MACAQUE MONKEY

However, little is known about the distribution of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the auditory system of macaque monkeys. In this study, we examined the overall distribution of cell bodies that expressed mRNAs for VGLUT1, and VGLUT2 (markers for glutamatergic neurons), GAD67 (a marker for GABAergic neurons), and GLYT2 (a marker for glycinergic neurons) in the auditory system of the Japanese macaque. In addition, we performed immunohistochemistry for VGLUT1, VGLUT2, and GAD67 in order to compare the distribution of proteins and mRNAs. We found that most of the excitatory neurons in the auditory brainstem expressed VGLUT2. In contrast, the expression of VGLUT1 mRNA was restricted to the auditory cortex (AC), periolivary nuclei, and cochlear nuclei (CN). The co-expression of GAD67 and GLYT2 mRNAs was common in the ventral nucleus of the lateral lemniscus (VNLL), CN, and superior olivary complex except for the medial nucleus of the trapezoid body, which expressed GLYT2 alone. In contrast, the dorsal nucleus of the lateral lemniscus, inferior colliculus, thalamus, and AC expressed GAD67 alone. The absence of co-expression of VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 in the medial geniculate, medial superior olive, and VNLL suggests that synaptic responses in the target neurons of these nuclei may be different between rodents and macaque monkeys.

From 8-13 g.w. mainly CaBP was expressed in the cells while fiber bundles traversing the thalamus in addition to CaBP expressed all GABA markers except GAD67. CaBP and PARV expression patterns in different nuclei changed over the time course studied, whereas NT was expressed consistently along the anterior-lateral curvature of the thalamus. CalR and SMI were detectable at 23 g.w. in the ventral parts of the dorsal thalamus. Most remarkably, punctate GAD65 immunoreactivity in the neuropil was confined to the nigro- and pallidothalamic afferent receiving nuclei from 16 to about 21 g.w., overlapping with that of CaBP in some of these nuclei (subdivisions of the ventral anterior and mediodorsal nuclei) and with PARV in others (centromedian nucleus). During this period, GAD65 immunoreactivity can be considered a marker of the basal ganglia afferent receiving territory in the motor thalamus. GAD67-positive local circuit neurons were first detected at 12-13 g.w. in the thalamic nuclei outside the basal ganglia afferent receiving territory. In the ventral anterior and centromedian nuclei, GAD-containing local circuit neurons were not conspicuous even at 22-23 g.w. The cells of the reticular nucleus expressed GAD67 and PARV from 12 g.w. on starting in the lateral-posterior regions. By 23 g.w., both markers were expressed in about two-thirds of the nucleus except for its most medial-anterior part. The results imply spatially and temporally differential expression of GABA and differentiation markers in the developing human thalamus.

We test the hypothesis that SIV-infection produces proton-magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (H-1-MRSI)-observed decline in the neuronal marker, N-acetylaspartate (NAA), and elevations in the glial marker, myo-inositol (mI), and associated creatine (Cr) and choline (Cho) in these structures.Design:Pre- and 4-6 weeks post-SIV infection (with CD8(+) T-lymphocyte depletion) was monitored with T-2-weighted quantitative MRI and 16x16x4 multivoxel H-1-MRSI (TE/TR=33/1400ms) in the brains of five rhesus macaques.Methods:Exploiting the high-resolution H-1-MRSI grid, we obtained absolute, cerebrospinal fluid partial volume-corrected NAA, Cr, Cho and mI concentrations from centrum semiovale, caudate nucleus, putamen, thalamus and hippocampus regions.Results:Pre- to post-infection mean Cr increased in the thalamus: 7.20.4 to 8.0 +/- 0.8mmol/l (+11%, P<0.05); mI increased in the centrum semiovale: 5.1 +/- 0.8 to 6.6 +/- 0.8mmol/l, caudate: 5.7 +/- 0.7 to 7.3 +/- 0.5mmol/l, thalamus: 6.8 +/- 0.8 to 8.5 +/- 0.8mmol/l and hippocampus: 7.7 +/- 1.2 to 9.9 +/- 0.4mmol/l (+29%, +27%, +24% and +29%, all P<0.05). NAA and Cho changes were not significant.Conclusion:SIV-infection appears to cause brain injury indirectly, through glial activation, while the deep gray matter structures' neuronal cell bodies are relatively spared. Treatment regimens to reduce gliosis may, therefore, prevent neuronal damage and its associated neurocognitive impairment.

Next to reviewing the role of beta oscillations in human beat perception, here we discuss the role of primate putaminal oscillatory activity in the control of rhythmic movements that are guided by a sensory metronome or internally gated. The analysis of the local field potentials of the behaving macaques showed that gamma-oscillations reflect local computations associated with stimulus processing of the metronome, whereas beta-activity involves the entrainment of large putaminal circuits, probably in conjunction with other elements of cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuit, during internally driven rhythmic tapping. Thus, this review emphasizes the need of parametric neurophysiological observations in non-human primates that display a well-controlled behavior during high-level cognitive processes.",Interval timing; Basal ganglia; Putamen; Beta oscillations; Neural encoding; Rhesus macaques; MEDIAL PREMOTOR CORTEX; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS OSCILLATIONS; BASAL GANGLIA; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; MOTOR CORTEX; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; BAND OSCILLATIONS; SENSORIMOTOR SYNCHRONIZATION; BEAT PERCEPTION; NEURAL ACTIVITY

They learned a series of new two-choice visual discriminations between coloured patterns displayed on a touch-sensitive monitor screen; the feedback for correct choice was delivery of food. Normal learning in this task is known to be dependent on the amygdala. The monkeys received brain lesions which were designed to disconnect the amygdala from interaction with other brain structures thought to be involved in this memory task. All the monkeys received an amygdalectomy in one hemisphere and lesions in the other hemisphere of some of the projection targets of the amygdala, namely the ventral striatum, the mediodorsal thalamus and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex. The rate of learning new problems was assessed before and after each operation. Disconnection of the amygdala from the ventral striatum was without effect on learning rate. An earlier study had shown that disconnection of the amygdala from either the mediodorsal thalamus or the ventromedial prefrontal cortex produced only a mild impairment, significantly less severe than that produced by bilateral lesions of any of these three structures. The present results show, however, that disconnection of the amygdala from both the mediodorsal thalamus and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in the same animal, by crossed unilateral lesions of the amygdala in one hemisphere and of both the mediodorsal thalamus and the ventromedial prefrontal cortex in the other hemisphere, produces an impairment as severe as that which follows bilateral lesions of any of these three structures. These results show that, in stimulus - reward associative memory, the role of the amygdala is entirely dependent on its interaction with the frontal lobe, either by direct projections or by indirect subcortical pathways including the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus; and that there are at least two partially independent pathways by which the amygdala can influence the frontal lobe.",CYNOMOLGUS; MACAQUE; VISUAL LEARNING; VENTRAL STRIATUM; VENTROMEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MEDIODORSAL NUCLEUS OF THE THALAMUS; MONKEYS; CORTEX; DISCONNECTION; ORGANIZATION; PROJECTIONS; NUCLEUS

Collinear flankers can enhance or decrease the perceptual and neuronal sensitivity to flanked stimuli. These effects are mediated through lateral interactions between neurons in the primary visual cortex (area V1), in conjunction with feedback from higher visual areas. The strength of lateral interactions is affected by cholinergic neuromodulation. Blockade of muscarinic receptors should increase the strength of lateral intracortical interactions, while nicotinic blockade should reduce thalamocortical feed-forward drive. Here we test this proposal through local iontophoretic application of the muscarinic receptor antagonist scopolamine and the nicotinic receptor antagonist mecamylamine, while recording single cells in parafoveal representations in awake fixating macaque V1. Collinear flankers generally reduced neuronal contrast sensitivity. Muscarinic and nicotinic receptor blockade equally reduced neuronal contrast sensitivity. Contrary to our hypothesis, flanker interactions were not systematically affected by either receptor blockade.",nan; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; SPATIAL INTEGRATION; SURROUND SUPPRESSION; LATERAL INTERACTIONS; CHOLINERGIC MODULATION; CONTRAST SENSITIVITY; STRIATE CORTEX; FEEDBACK; ACETYLCHOLINE; NEUROMODULATION

The subcortical connections of MST and FST were found to be very similar. Both areas were found to be reciprocally connected with the pulvinar, mainly with its medial subdivision, and with the claustrum. Nonreciprocal projections from both MST and FST were consistently found in the striatum (caudate and putamen), reticular nucleus of the thalamus, and the pontine nuclei. The labeled terminals in the pons were in the dorsolateral, lateral, dorsal, and peduncular nuclei. Additional nonreciprocal projections were found in one MST and one FST case to the nucleus of the optic tract, and, in one FST case, to the lateral terminal nucleus. Finally, three cases showed a nonreciprocal projection to FST from the basal forebrain. The subcortical structures containing label following MST and FST injections were largely the same as those labeled after injections of the middle temporal visual area (MT), but the label within each structure after MST and FST injections was more widespread than that from MT, overlapping the distribution of label that has been reported after injections of parietal visual areas.

Dysregulation of the CRF system may underlie the pathophysiology of several disorders, including depression and anxiety. The distribution of CRF1 mRNA and CRF1 specific ligand binding has been reported by multiple groups in rodents using in situ hybridization and receptor autoradiography, respectively. More recently, somewhat conflicting rodent anti-CRF1 immunohistochemical studies were reported. In this study we report the generation of an antihuman CRF1 antiserum and provide the first immunohistochemical description of CRF1 distribution in a primate brain, that of the rhesus monkey. The specificity of anti-CRF-R1 antiserum R221 was demonstrated using transfected hCRF(1)-expressing HEK 293 cells and rhesus monkey pituitary. CRF1-immunoreactive neurons were widespread in the rhesus brain. CRF1 staining was associated with neuronal cell bodies and dendrites and was primarily intracellular, suggesting a high rate of receptor turnover or receptor sequestration. Anti-CRF1 immunoreactivity was most abundant in pituitary, cerebellum, and in portions of brain stem associated with sensorimotor function. CRF1 staining was also observed in cerebral cortex, basal forebrain, portions of the basal ganglia, and thalamus. Staining was relatively low in prefrontal cortex and in limbic areas, which may reflect masking of the N-terminal epitope. The distribution of CRF1 immunoreactivity is suggestive of roles in attentional processing as well as the processing of motor and sensory information.

However, except for the visual modality, little is known about its sensory functions. A hypothesis is that, as a region of convergence of information from different sensory modalities, the medial pulvinar plays a role in multisensory integration. To test this hypothesis, 2 macaque monkeys were trained to a fixation task and the responses of single-units to visual, auditory, and auditory-visual stimuli were examined. Analysis revealed auditory, visual, and multisensory neurons in the medial pulvinar. It also revealed multisensory integration in this structure, mainly suppressive (the audiovisual response is less than the strongest unisensory response) and subadditive (the audiovisual response is less than the sum of the auditory and the visual responses).

Neuroanatomical tracers were injected throughout the caudorostral extent of the auditory core and rostral STP by direct visualization of the cortical surface. Auditory cortical areas were distinguished by SMI-32 immunostaining for neurofilament, in addition to established cytoarchitectonic criteria. The results describe a pathway comprising step-wise projections from AI through the rostral and rostrotemporal fields of the core (R and RT), continuing to the recently identified rostrotemporal polar field (RTp) and the dorsal temporal pole. Each area was strongly and reciprocally connected with the areas immediately caudal and rostral to it, though deviations from strictly serial connectivity were observed. In RTp, inputs converged from core, belt, parabelt, and the auditory thalamus, as well as higher order cortical regions.

On the basis of its connectivity and physiology, this nucleus has been implicated in the control of saccadic eye movements, Because of the complexity of its afferent signals and its simple efferent signal, there must be much local interaction within the ZI to integrate these various afferents, The purpose of this study was to investigate, at the ultrastructural level, whether the ZI contains the anatomical substrata which could subserve the control of eye movements, Methods: Blocks of tissue from the ZI of macaque monkeys were prepared for electron microscopy using standard techniques. Some of these animals were taken specifically for electron microscopy, Others had received injections of tracer substances and were prepared for electron microscopy subsequent to tracer visualization, Results: Cell bodies of medium-large neurons were found in our preparations, They have large nucleoli and relatively small volumes of karyoplasm, Cell bodies and dendrites of all sizes have many synaptic contacts, Three types of synaptic profiles were found, designated Types 1, 2, and 3. Type 1 profiles are symmetrical and contact cell bodies and small dendrites. Spe 2 profiles are thought to be presynaptic dendrites and may have symmetrical or asymmetrical contacts, Type 3 profiles are asymmetrical and primarily contact small dendrites, Many synapses contacted vesicle-containing profiles, In some cases, it was clear that these profiles participated in serial synapses on presumptive presynaptic dendrites, Other profiles appeared to be axoaxonic contacts, Conclusions: Afferent and efferent signals are Likely to be modulated extensively within the ZI. Therefore, there needs to be complex interactions between neuronal elements of the ZI and its afferents, This study demonstrates that this nucleus possesses the structural substrata to subserve diverse roles, such as the gating of saccadic eye movements.

In a sample of 4654 excitatory neurons, synapse cover did not correlate consistently with cell variety (pyramid or spiny stellate), soma size, synaptic apposition length or thalamic input. There were significant differences in somatic synapse cover per layer, but the pattern of differences in cover among layers differed significantly between animals, suggesting that laminar environment alone is not a generally applicable determinant of amount of inhibitory synapse cover. The pattern of cover for cells in different layers was, however, similar between the two hemispheres of an individual monkey. Measures of inhibitory synapse cover on four sets of pyramidal neurons in layers 5 and 6, each with different efferent projection targets, showed that the sets differed significantly from other cells in their respective layers, and differed significantly from each other. These findings demonstrate that there is unique circuitry for different subsystems within single layers of cortex and provide a rationale for the rich variety of cortical GABAergic interneurons within single layers.",nan; LOCAL CIRCUIT NEURONS; STRIATE CORTEX; CORTICOTHALAMIC CELLS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; MEYNERT CELLS; AREA 17; ORGANIZATION; AFFERENT; PATTERNS; NUMBER

Studies in rodents have provided insight in the interplay between intrinsic genetic mechanisms and extrinsic inputs relayed to the cortex by thalamocortical axons. Here we focus on the exploration of the developing primate visual system which points to embryonic thalamic axons exerting a profound, early instructive role on arealisation in the primate cortex, via an influence on cortical progenitor cell-cycle and mode of division.

Twelve right-handed, schizophrenic patients treated with typical or atypical antipsychotics and 6 healthy control subjects were studied with fMRI while performing a 2-back working memory task. Effective connectivity within a cortical-subcortical-cerebellar network for mnemonic information processing was assessed and compared between both groups. The path model included cortico-cortical connections comprising the parietal association cortex, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC), and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) as well as a cortico-cerebellar feedback loop comprising prefrontal cortex, contralateral cerebellum, and thalamus. Group differences were analyzed with a stacked models approach. Relative to normal controls, both patient groups revealed a pattern of reduced connectivity within the prefrontal-cerebellar and the cerebellar-thalamic limbs but enhanced connectivity in the thalamo-cortical limb of the cortical-cerebellar circuit. Moreover. a direct comparison of both treatment groups revealed enhanced connectivity in the interhemispheric connections between the cortical association areas in patients treated with atypical antipsychotics. However, right prefrontal and left parieto-frontal path coefficients were lower in the patient group receiving atypical antispychotic drugs. The findings suggest that the relationship between pathology in cortical-subcortical cerebellar networks and associated functional connectivity is complex and may include aspects of increased and decreased levels of connectivity consistent with the notion of cognitive dysmetria in schizophrenia. The observed pronounced connectivity within thalamo-cortical projections could be attributed to a compensatory increase of thalamic input in the presence of disrupted effective connectivity within the preceding limb of the cortical-cerebellar circuitry. The study demonstrated the feasibility of structural equation modeling for the investigation of group and treatment-related differences in effective connectivity and provides a promising approach to further disentangle the relationship between altered functional capacity and associated fMRI signal changes.

Topography and synaptic organization of the pallidothalamic projection,"The objectives of this study were, on one hand, to better understand how the segregated functional pathways from the cerebral cortex through the striatopallidal complex emerged in the projections to the thalamus and, on the other hand, to compare the ultrastructure and synaptic organization of the pallidal efferents to the ventrolateral (VL) and centromedian (CM) thalamic nuclei in primates. These aims were achieved by injections of the retrograde-anterograde tracer, biotinylated dextran amine (BDA), in different functional regions of the internal pallidum (GPi) in squirrel monkeys. The location of retrogradely labelled cells in the striatum was determined to ascertain the functional specificity of the injection sites. Injections in the ventrolateral two-thirds of the GPi (group 1) led to retrograde labelling in the postcommissural region of the putamen (''sensorimotor striatum'') and plexuses of labelled fibers in the rostral one-third of the principal ventrolateral nucleus (VLp) and the central part of the CM. On the other hand, injections in the dorsal one-third (group 3) and the rostromedial pole (group 4) of the GPi led to retrogradely labelled cells in the body of the caudate nucleus (''associative striatum'') and the ventral striatum (''limbic striatum''), respectively. After those injections, dense plexuses of anterogradely labelled varicosities were found in common thalamic nuclei, including the parvocellular ventral anterior nucleus (VApc), the dorsal VL (VLd), and the rostrodorsal part of the parafascicular nucleus (PF). In the caudal two-thirds of the CM/PF, the labelled fibers formed a band that lay along the dorsal border of the complex in a region called the dorsolateral PF (PFdl) in this study. The ventromedial nucleus (VM) was densely labelled only after injections in the rostromedial GPi, whereas the dorsal part of the zona incerta was labelled in both groups. At the electron microscopic level, the BDA-positive terminals in the VLp were larger and more elongated than those in the CM but, overall, displayed the same pattern of synaptic organization. Our findings indicate 1) that some associative and limbic cortical information, which is largely processed in segregated corticostriatopallidal channels, converges to common thalamic nuclei and 2) that the PF is a major target of associative and limbic GPi efferents in monkeys.

The subjects actively stroked their fingertips over gratings that varied in groove width. Many cells in each location displayed average firing rates that incrementally reflected groove width dimensions (0.5-2.9 mm). Approximately 10% of cortical cells were more active to surfaces with narrower grooves, i.e., had negative graded response functions. All thalamic cells and similar to 50% of cortical cells with positive graded functions to gratings also showed increased responsiveness to contact force. Some cells also varied their activity with stroke speed. Many thalamic, a few primary somatosensory cortical cells, and no secondary somatosensory cortical cells showed periodic firing patterns that reflected the spatial-temporal frequency of stimulation. Responses to gratings of nearly every cell with negative graded responses and the remaining cortical cells with positive functions were independent of contact force and stroke velocity. The results only partially confirm predictions based on different models of texture perception that propose spatial, intensive, or cross modal neural codes.

We recognize three subdivisions of the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), which are architectonically distinct from the neighboring somatosensory and visual cortices. Furthermore, we show that the different parietal areas are differently connected with thalamic nuclei. The medial portion of PPC (mPPC) is connected primarily with the medial portion of the lateral posterior nucleus (LP), whereas the lateral portion (lPPC) connects with the posterior complex (Po). The more caudolateral part of PPC (PtP) also projects to Po but can be distinguished from lPPC based on architectonic criteria. The primary somatic and visual cortices, neighboring PPC, are preferentially connected with the primary ventral posterior and dorsolateral geniculate nuclei, respectively, and less with the associational Po and LP. Particularly the border between the secondary visual cortex and the PPC has been a matter of controversy, but here we show that, although PPC subareas are connected with Po and medial LP, the medial and lateral secondary visual cortices are connected with lateral LP and a portion of medial LP different from that connected with PPC. The resulting delineations and specifications of connectivity with thalamic nuclei together with upcoming studies of cortical connectivity will facilitate detailed studies on the role of the subdivisions of PPC in the rat as diverse, higher order associative cortical areas, comparable to those described in the primate.for J.

Here we show that the receptive fields of these cells differ in size and response latency but not at random. We have found that in the cat lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) the receptive field size and response latency of neighboring neurons are significantly correlated: the larger the receptive field, the faster the response to visual stimuli. This correlation is widespread in LGN. It is found in groups of cells belonging to the same type ( e. g., Y cells), and of different types (i.e., X and Y), within a specific layer or across different layers. These results indicate that the inputs from the multiple geniculate afferents that converge onto a cortical cell ( approximately 30) are likely to arrive in a sequence determined by the receptive field size of the geniculate afferents. Recent studies have shown that the peak of the spatial frequency tuning of a cortical cell shifts toward higher frequencies as the response progresses in time. Our results are consistent with the idea that these shifts in spatial frequency tuning arise from differences in the response time course of the thalamic inputs.",nan; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; RETINAL GANGLION-CELL; Y-CELLS; X-CELLS; SPATIAL-FREQUENCY; W-CELLS; MACAQUE MONKEYS; NEURONS; CORTEX; ORGANIZATION

Afferent input responses were recorded extracellularly during cortical inactivation through superfusion of the cortex with muscimol, allowing investigation of lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus (LGN) cell properties in the absence of cortical feedback. Responses from afferent inputs were classified as magno-, parvo-, or koniocellular based on anatomical organization within the cortex, established through histological reconstructions, and visual response wavelength sensitivity. More than 80% of afferents showed strong surround suppression [ suppression index (SI) > 0.5] and 14% showed negligible surround suppression (SI < 0.2). Afferent responses with weak and strong surround suppression were found throughout cortical input layers 4C and 4A. High-contrast estimates of the spatial extent of the classical surround were similar to the nonclassical surround. The classical and nonclassical surrounds were, on average, 1.5-fold larger than the excitatory center. Unlike neurons within V1, the spatial extent of excitatory summation for geniculocortical afferents was contrast invariant. Nonclassical surround suppression showed slight contrast dependency with estimates larger (20%) at lower contrasts and stronger at higher contrasts (13%). Surround suppression is inherent in cortical input responses and likely derives from lateral inhibition in either the LGN or retina. Although surround suppression within afferent responses increases slightly with contrast, the spatial spread of excitation remains fixed with contrast. This argues for distinct mechanisms of action for contrast-dependent modulation in cortical and subcortical responses.",nan; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; RECEPTIVE-FIELD PROPERTIES; MARMOSET CALLITHRIX-JACCHUS; V1 NEURONS; GALAGO-CRASSICAUDATUS; STRIATE CORTEX; CONTRAST-SENSITIVITY; KONIOCELLULAR CELLS; RESPONSE PROPERTIES; RELAY CELLS

Reconstructions of labeled terminals and their beaded varicosities in the neostriatum and thalamus were analyzed quantitatively to compare the extent of overlapping projections to both subcortical structures. Corticostriatal projections from focal sites in both somatosensory areas exhibited substantial amounts of divergence within the dorsolateral neostriatum. Most of the labeled terminals were concentrated in densely packed arborizations that occupied lamellar-shaped regions along the dorsolateral edge of the neostriatum. Tracer injections in both cortical areas also produced dense anterograde and retrograde labeling in the thalamus, especially in the ventrobasal complex (VB) and in the medial part of the posterior (POm) nucleus. Because these thalamic regions are topographically organized and have reciprocal connections with corresponding representations in both SI and SII, the amount of labeled overlap in the thalamus was used to indicate the degree of somatotopic correspondence at the SI and SII injection sites. We found that the proportion of overlapping projections to the neostriatum was moderately correlated with the amount of overlap observed in the thalamus. This result strongly indicates that specific sites in the dorsolateral neostriatum receive convergent projections from corresponding somatotopic representations in SI and SII, but also suggests that some of the corticostriatal divergence may reflect neostriatal integration of somatosensory information from noncorresponding representations in SI and SII.

[C-11]CB-119 was synthesized with high specific activity by alkylation of a phenolic precursor with [C-11]methyl iodide. In vitro autoradiographic studies using rhesus brain slices were carried out using [H-3]CB-119, and in vivo imaging studies were carried out using [C-11]CB-119 in rhesus monkeys under baseline and blocked conditions. Autoradiographic studies in rhesus brain showed the expected distribution pattern for CB1R with highest binding in the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, caudate/putamen, globus pallidus, substantia nigra, and hippocampus. Lower binding was seen in the posterior hypothalamus, ventral tegmental area, and periventricular gray area, and the lowest binding was in the thalamic nuclei. The binding of [H-3]CB-119 was fully blocked by the addition of 10 mu M CB-119. Rhesus positron emission tomography imaging studies showed very good brain uptake and a distribution pattern consistent with that seen in the autoradiographic studies. The kinetics of tracer uptake was slow. The brain uptake was blocked by pretreatment with taranabant, a CB1R inverse agonist.

Whether functional connections between CG neurons and LGN relay neurons obey or ignore the separation of feedforward visual signals into parallel processing streams is not known. Accordingly, there is some debate about whether CG neurons are morphologically heterogeneous or homogenous. Here we characterized the morphology of CG neurons in the ferret, a visual carnivore with distinct feedforward parallel processing streams, and compared the morphology of ferret CG neurons with CG neuronal morphology previously described in macaque monkeys [Briggs et al. (2016) Neuron, 90, 388]. We used a G-deleted rabies virus as a retrograde tracer to label CG neurons in adult ferrets. We then reconstructed complete dendritic morphologies for a large sample of virus-labeled CG neurons. Quantification of CG morphology revealed three distinct CG neuronal subtypes with striking similarities to the CG neuronal subtypes observed in macaques. These findings suggest that CG neurons may be morphologically diverse in a variety of highly visual mammals in which feedforward visual pathways are organized into parallel processing streams. Accordingly, these results provide support for the notion that CG feedback is functionally parallel stream-specific in ferrets and macaques.",corticogeniculate; LGN; morphology; RRID: AB_10013483; RRID: AB_221570; RRID: SCR_001622; RRID: SCR_001775; V1; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; INDIVIDUAL X-CELL; STRIATE CORTEX; LAYER-VI; AREAS 17; SUBLAMINAR ORGANIZATION; FEEDBACK PATHWAY; LOCAL CIRCUITRY; CAT

Terminations from the amygdala were denser and larger in pOFC compared with the anterior cingulate cortex, which is also strongly connected with the amygdala. Axons from the amygdala terminated most densely in the upper layers of pOFC through large terminals. Most of these terminals innervated spines of presumed excitatory neurons and many were frequently multisynaptic and perforated, suggesting high synaptic efficacy. These amygdalar synapses in pOFC exceeded in size and specialization even thalamocortical terminals from the prefrontal-related thalamic mediodorsal nucleus to the middle cortical layers, which are thought to be highly efficient drivers of cortical neurons. Pathway terminals in the upper layers impinge on the apical dendrites of neurons in other layers, suggesting that the robust amygdalar projections may also activate neurons in layer 5 that project back to the amygdala and beyond to autonomic structures. Among inhibitory neurons, the amygdalar pathway innervated preferentially the neurochemical classes of calbindin and calretinin neurons in the upper layers of pOFC, which are synaptically suited to suppress noise and enhance signals. These features provide a circuit mechanism for flexibly shifting focus and adjusting emotional drive in processes disrupted in psychiatric disorders, such as phobias and obsessive-compulsive disorder.",emotion and amygdala; neural circuits; OCD; orbitofrontal; synapse; thalamus; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER; THALAMIC RETICULAR NUCLEUS; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; AMPA RECEPTOR EXPRESSION; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; CHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS; DISTINGUISHING DRIVERS; CORTICAL CONNECTIONS; SYMPTOM PROVOCATION

Tactile allodynia, in which innocuous tactile stimuli are perceived as painful, is common in patients with CPSP. Previous brain imaging studies have reported plastic changes in brain activity in patients with tactile allodynia after stroke, but a causal relationship between such changes and the symptoms has not been established. We recently developed a non-human primate (macaque) model of CPSP based on thalamic lesions, in which the animals show behavioral changes consistent with the occurrence of tactile allodynia. Here we performed functional magnetic resonance imaging under propofol anesthesia to investigate the changes in brain activation associated with the allodynia in this CPSP model. Before the lesion, innocuous tactile stimuli significantly activated the contralateral sensorimotor cortex. When behavioral changes were observed after the thalamic lesion, equivalent stimuli significantly activated pain-related brain areas, including the posterior insular cortex (PIC), secondary somatosensory cortex (SII), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and amygdala. Moreover, when either PIC/SII or ACC was pharmacologically inactivated, the signs of tactile allodynia were dampened. Our results show that increased cortical activity plays a role in CPSP-induced allodynia.",Allodynia; Chronic pain; Functional brain imaging; Inactivation; Non-human primate; Thalamic pain; Ventral posterolateral nucleus; ANTERIOR CINGULOTOMY; NEURAL ACTIVATION; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; MOTOR CORTEX; PROJECTIONS; MECHANISMS; ALLODYNIA; INSULA; LESION; ORGANIZATION

The goal of the study was to evaluate a high affinity and high selectivity antagonist, [C-11]P943, as a positron emission tomography (PET) tracer for imaging the 5-HT1B receptor. [C-11]P943 was synthesized via N-methylation of the precursor with [C-11]methyl iodide or [C-11]methyl triflate using automated modules. The average radiochemical yield was approx. 10% with radiochemical purity of >99% and specific activity of 8.8 +/- 3.6 mCi/nmol at the end-of-synthesis (n=37). PET imaging was performed in non-human primates with a high-resolution research tomograph scanner with a bolus/infusion paradigm. Binding potential (BPND) was calculated using the equilibrium ratios of regions to cerebellum. The tracer uptake was highest in the globus pallidus and occipital cortex, moderate in basal ganglia and thalamus, and lowest in the cerebellum, which is consistent with the known brain distribution of 5-HT1B receptors. Infusion of tracer at different specific activities (by adding various amount of unlabeled P943) reduced BPND values in a dose-dependent manner, demonstrating the saturability of the tracer binding. Blocking studies with GR127935 (2 mg/kg iv), a selective 5-HT1B/5-HT1D antagonist, resulted in reduction of BPND values by 42-95% across regions; for an example, in occipital region from 0.71 to 0.03, indicating a complete blockade. These results demonstrate the saturability and specificity of [C-11]P943 for 5-HT1B receptors, suggesting its suitability as a PET radiotracer for in vivo evaluations of the 5-HT1B receptor system in humans.

We reported previously how the anlage of the retrosplenial cortex merges with the immature presubicular zone in the fetal rhesus monkey at the end of the first trimester of gestation. In the present study, this caudal area was further defined on a chemoarchitectonic basis, particularly during the late prenatal and perinatal stages, which correspond to the development of the cingulate sulcus and temporal gyri, and the differentiation of the retrosplenial/subicular complex. Neurotensin (NT), a pyramidal cell marker in the limbic cortex, and parvalbumin (PV), a marker of a subset of inhibitory local circuit neurons in the hippocampal formation, were used as immunocytochemical markers. According to distinct chemoarchitectural patterns, (1) areas 29l and 29m of the retrosplenial cortex formed a triangle-shaped ventral expansion which merged with a similar but dorsal expansion of the pre/parasubicular fields. A temporal extension of area 29m down to area TH could not be detected. The pre/parasubiculum contributed with area 29m to the lateral bank of the calcarine sulcus as far as the most caudal extent of the hippocampal formation. (2) The lamina principalis interna of the presubiculum was well individualized and did not appear as a simple horizontal shift of adjoining fields. (3) NT and PV displayed a distinct temporal profile of development. NT was already expressed in the pyramidal cells of the prospective retrosplenial cortex and ventral hippocampal formation at E47 (term 165 days). Major pathways of the hippocampal formation and retrosplenial cortex (fimbria, fornix, angular and cingulum bundles) were progressively labeled indicating early developing projections. A large set of NT-positive afferents reached the retrosplenial cortex between E114 and E120. Their laminar distribution was compatible with a thalamic or a subicular origin. (4) The development of PV expression was delayed until the last quarter of gestation, supporting its proposal as a signal of functional onset. The developmental fate and the particular connections of the presubiculum suggest that its functional importance should be further investigated during infancy and adulthood.

For reasons that remain unclear, the patterns of ocular dominance are very diverse across species and can take the shape of highly organized stripes, convoluted beads, or no pattern at all. Here, we use a new image-processing algorithm to measure ocular dominance patterns more accurately than in the past. We use these measurements to demonstrate that ocular dominance maps follow a common organizing principle that makes the cortical axis with the slowest retinotopic gradient orthogonal to the ocular dominance stripes. We demonstrate this relation in multiple regions of the primary visual cortex from individual animals, and different species. Moreover, consistent with the increase in the retinotopic gradient with visual eccentricity, we demonstrate a strong correlation between eccentricity and ocular dominance stripe width. We also show that an eye/polarity grid emerges within the visual cortical map when the representation of light and dark stimuli segregates along an axis orthogonal to the ocular dominance stripes, as recently demonstrated in cats. Based on these results, we propose a developmental model of visual cortical topography that sorts thalamic afferents by eye input and stimulus polarity, and then maximizes the binocular retinotopic match needed for depth perception and the light-dark retinotopic mismatch needed to process stimulus orientation. In this model, the different ocular dominance patterns simply emerge from differences in local retinotopic cortical topography.",ocular dominance; plasticity; receptive field; thalamocortical; thalamus; visual cortex; STRIATE CORTEX; SIMPLE CELLS; ORIENTATION COLUMNS; BINOCULAR DISPARITY; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; MACAQUE MONKEY; LAYER-IV; REPRESENTATION; AFFERENTS; PRIMATE

We find that, in the retina, alphaCamKII expression also differentiates two primary groups of ganglion cell, both characterized by broad, sparsely branching dendritic trees and cell bodies intermediate in size between the parvo- and magnocellular-projecting ganglion cells. Cells in the first group have three or four primary dendrites, a thick axon, and a rounded cell body and likely are made up of multiple types. In contrast, ganglion cells in the second group demonstrate a highly regular morphology, with strictly two primary dendrites and a thinner axon emanating from a smaller, elliptical cell body. This cell resembles the large sparse ganglion cell identified by others in retrograde labeling from the LGN and represents about 2% of all ganglion cells. In the optic nerve, alphaCamKII+ axons are also intermediate in size and form a bimodal distribution, correlating with the axonal sizes of the two groups of ganglion cell. For the LGN, we describe a group of aCamKII+ axon terminals with morphology consistent with terminals from retinal ganglion cells. These terminals form long, filamentous contacts with aCamKII+ relay cells and increase in frequency from the dorsal to the ventral koniocellular regions. Our results indicate that ganglion cells expressing aCamKII represent multiple projections to the brain, at least one of which provides input to one or more koniocellular regions of the LGN.

It may therefore be difficult to translate the results to the clinical situations. In the present study, the detailed change of NET occupancy was investigated among a wider range of doses in a more advanced manner. Two rhesus monkeys were examined using a high-resolution PET system with (S,S)-[F-18]FMeNER-D-2 under baseline conditions and after steady-state infusion of different doses of atomoxetine (0.003 to 0.12 mg/kg per hour). NET occupancy of the thalamus, brainstem and anterior cingulate cortex was calculated using BPND obtained with the simplified reference tissue model. NET occupancy increased regionally and uniformly as the plasma concentration of atomoxetine increased. The estimated Kd value (the amount to occupy 50% of NET) in the thalamus was 16 ng/ml.

Loss of neurons has been reported in the cerebral cortex following immunodeficiency viral infection. but thalamic structures which may contribute to electrophysiological changes and neurological deficits have not been examined. In this study, the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of macaques inoculated with macrophage-tropic, neurovirulent virus SIV(mac)239 (R71 and 17E) was examined for neuron loss using the optical fractionator method. Estimates of the number of neurons in the P layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus of age-matched control macaques ranged from 1.0 to 1.3 x 10(6), while the number of neurons in SIV infected macaques ranged from 0.8 to 1.1 x 10(6), reflecting neuron loss of up to 28%. Neuron loss was not observed in the magnocellular layers, The total number of glia and glial density were unchanged. Loss of neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus was correlated with the pattern of neuropathological changes. Neuron loss was most severe in animals with encephalitis concentrated in the brain stem and subcortical white matter and was less apparent in animals with diffuse encephalitis, Neuron loss in the lateral geniculate nucleus did not explain changes observed in the visual evoked potential, which was severely affected in two animals which showed a loss of 24 and 26%, while it was normal in a third animal which showed neuron loss of 28%.",simian immunodeficiency virus; AIDS; lateral geniculate nucleus; fractionator; neuron death; NUMBER; INVOLVEMENT; NEOCORTEX; MONKEYS; CORTEX; AIDS

In this study, we examined the timing and occurrence of perisaccadic modulation of LGN single-unit activity in awake-behaving macaque monkeys while they made spontaneous saccades in the dark and made visually guided saccades to discrete stimuli located outside the receptive field. Our hypothesis was that the activity of LGN cells is modulated by efference copies of motor plans to produce saccadic eye movements and that this modulation depends neither on the presence of feedforward visual information nor on a corollary discharge of signals directing saccadic eye movements. On average, 25% of LGN cells demonstrated significant perisaccadic modulation. This modulation consisted of a moderate suppression of activity that began more than 100 ms prior to the initiation of a saccadic eye movement and continued beyond the termination of the saccadic eye movement. This suppression was followed by a large enhancement of activity after the eyes arrived at the next fixation. Although members of all three LGN relay cell classes (magnocellular, parvocellular, and koniocellular) demonstrated significant saccade-related suppression and enhancement of activity, more cells demonstrated postsaccadic enhancement (25%) than perisaccadic suppression (17%). In no case did the timing of the modulation coincide directly with saccade duration. The degree of modulation observed did not vary with LGN cell class, LGN receptive field center location, center sign (ON-center or OFF-center), or saccade latency or velocity. The time course of modulation did, however, vary with saccade size such that suppression was longer for longer saccades. The fact that activity from a percentage of LGN cells from all cell classes was modulated in relationship to saccadic eye movements in the absence of direct visual stimulation suggests that this modulation is a general phenomenon not tied to specific types of visual stimuli. Similarly, because the onset of the modulation preceded eye movements by more than 100 ms, it is likely that this modulation reflects higher order motor-planning rather than a corollary of mechanisms in direct control of eye movements themselves. Finally, the fact that the largest modulation is a postsaccadic enhancement of activity may suggest that perisaccadic modulations are designed more for the facilitation of visual information processing once the eyes land at a new location than for filtering unwanted visual stimuli.",primates; vision; thalamus; eye movement; saccade; SACCADIC EYE-MOVEMENTS; VISUAL THRESHOLD; RETINOGENICULATE TRANSMISSION; UNIT-ACTIVITY; TIME-COURSE; SUPPRESSION; NEURONS; CELLS; CORTEX; CAT

Projections from the dentate and IA nuclei overlap in central parts of the body of RTP, but the terminal field of dentate axons extends dorsomedial and rostral to the terminal field of IA axons, and I4 terminal fields extend more ventrolaterally. A caudal to rostral topography of projections from each nucleus onto dorsal to ventral parts of RTP was seen. Projections from rostral parts of both nuclei terminate in a sublemniscal part of the nucleus. The topography of dentate and IA projections onto central to ventrolateral RTP appears to match somatotopic maps of these cerebellar nuclei with the somatotopic map of projections to RTP from primary motor cortex. Projections from caudal and ventral parts of the dentate nucleus appear to overlap oculomotor inputs to rostral, dorsal, and medial RTP from the frontal and supplementary eye fields, the superior colliculus, and the oculomotor region of the caudal fastigial nucleus. Projections to the paramedian part of RTP from vestibular area y were also found in two cases that correlated with projections to vertical oculomotor motoneurons. The maps of dentate and IA projections onto RTP correlate predictably with maps of dentate and IA projections to the ventrolateral thalamus and subnuclei of the red nucleus that were made from these same cases (Stanton [1980b] J.

Effects of cortical feedback on the spatial properties of relay cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus. J Neurophysiol 109: 889-899, 2013. First published October 24, 2012; doi: 10.1152/jn.00194.2012.-Feedback connections to early-level sensory neurons have been shown to affect many characteristics of their neural response. Because selectivity for stimulus size is a fundamental property of visual neurons, we examined the summation tuning and discretely mapped receptive field (RF) properties of cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) both with and without feedback from visual cortex. Using extracellular recording in halothane-anesthetized cats, we used small luminance probes displaced in Cartesian coordinates to measure discrete response area, and optimal sinusoidal gratings of varying diameter to estimate preferred optimal summation size and level of center-surround antagonism. In conditions where most cortical feedback was pharmacologically removed, discretely mapped RF response areas showed an overall significant enlargement for the population compared with control conditions. A switch to increased levels of burst firing, spatially displaced from the RF center, suggested this was mediated by changes in excitatory-inhibitory balance across visual space. With the use of coextensive stimulation, there were overall highly significant increases in the optimal summation size and reduction of surround antagonism with removal of cortical feedback in the LGN. When fitted with a difference-of-Gaussian (DOG) model, changes in the center size, center amplitude, and surround amplitude parameters were most significantly related to the removal of cortical feedback. In summary, corticothalamic innervation of the visual thalamus can modify spatial summation properties in LGN relay cells, an effect most parsimoniously explained by changes in the excitatory-inhibitory balance.",summation; receptive field; visual cortex; corticothalamic; corticofugal; THALAMIC RETICULAR NUCLEUS; RECEPTIVE-FIELD PROPERTIES; MACAQUE V1 NEURONS; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; INPUT X-CELLS; CORTICOGENICULATE PATHWAY; RETINOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; CORTICOFUGAL FEEDBACK; STRIATE CORTEX; GANGLION-CELLS

However, the relative extent of both representations is subject to considerable species variation. The present study employed microelectrode mapping and anatomical tracing to investigate the location and extent of the ipsilateral representation in area 3b of the somatosensory cortex of squirrel monkeys. A small region, approximately 2 mm(2), was found to be responsive to stimulation of ipsilateral intraoral structures. This region was located on the anteromedial border of area 3b, surrounded by the representation of the contralateral roof of the mouth. This region corresponded to areas of intense anterograde labeling following injections placed in the ventromedial portion of the ventral posterior medial nucleus of the thalamus at the only sites where neural responses could be elicited by stimulation of ipsilateral intraoral structures. The amount of thalamus and cortex given over to the ipsilateral representation in the squirrel monkey is small compared with that of the macaque monkey. This difference may be related to the lack of cheek pouches in the squirrel monkey, and therefore a different strategy for eating. The representation of the contralateral lower lip in area 3b was split by the representation of the contralateral upper lip. This split representation is in agreement with previous studies of the trigeminal representation in area 3b of the macaque monkey and may be a general feature of the representation of the trigeminal nerve in area 3b of primate cerebral cortex.

The brainstem and the thalamus were devoid of immunostained cell bodies, whereas in the hypothalamus immunopositive perikarya were observed in the supraoptic nucleus, the anterior hypothalamus, the preoptic region and in the arcuate nucleus. Our findings also showed that the hypothalamus is richer in immunostained fibres, and that in this region such fibres are more widely distributed than in the thalamus and upper brainstem. No immunopositive fibres were observed in the lower brainstem. Our results point to a more widespread distribution of LH-RH-immunostained perikarya in the cat hypothalamus than that previously reported in the cat; a similar distribution to that found in the rat, and a more restricted distribution than in primates. Additionally, our study shows a more widespread distribution of immunostained fibres in the cat brainstem and diencephalon than that previously described for other mammals. In this context, our results describe for the first time in the mammals central nervous system fibres containing LH-RH located in the stria medullaris of the thalamus, the supra mammillary decussation, the laterodorsal and lateroposterior thalamic nuclei, the nucleus reuniens, the supraoptic nucleus, and the optic chiasm. Thus, our findings reveal that LH-RH-immunostained structures are widely distributed in the upper brainstem and in the diencephalon of the cat, suggesting that the peptide may be involved in several physiological functions.

This Review describes progress in understanding the organization and function of networks embedded within these association regions. Detailed high-resolution analyses of single individuals suggest that the default network is not a single network, as historically described, but instead comprises multiple interwoven networks. The multiple networks share a common organizational motif (also evident in marmoset and macaque anatomical circuits) that might support a general class of processing function dependent on internally constructed rather than externally constrained representations, with each separate interwoven network specialized for a distinct processing domain. Direct neuronal recordings in humans and monkeys reveal evidence for competitive relationships between the internally and externally oriented networks. Findings from rodent studies suggest that the thalamus might be essential to controlling which networks are engaged through specialized thalamic reticular neurons, including antagonistic subpopulations. These association networks (and presumably thalamocortical circuits) are expanded in humans and might be particularly vulnerable to dysregulation implicated in mental illness.",nan; INTRINSIC FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; THALAMIC RETICULAR NUCLEUS; CONSCIOUS RESTING STATE; MODE NETWORK; AUTOBIOGRAPHICAL MEMORY; POSTERIOR CINGULATE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ASSOCIATION NETWORKS; DISTRIBUTED NETWORKS; CORTICAL CONNECTIONS

Recently, we have demonstrated that JC virus can infect cerebellar granule cell neurons and cortical pyramidal neurons in immunosuppressed people. To examine whether SV40 neuronal infection occurs spontaneously in immunosuppressed macaques, we analyzed archival brain specimens from 20 simian immunodeficiency virus-infected rhesus with AIDS and 1 cynomolgus post-transplant selected with SV40 brain infection from archival records from 1991 to 2012. In addition to white matter SV40 distribution in classic demyelinating progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, some of the 21 monkeys exhibited meningeal, subpial neocortical, and periventricular virus. This distribution pattern corresponded to broader viral tropism with neuronal infection in 14 (66.7%) of 21 cases. In all 14 cases, identified neurons were positive for early SV40 transcript large T antigen, but only 4 of the 14 cases exhibited Late viral transcript viral protein 1-positive neurons. SV40-infected neurons were detected in frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal cortices, hippocampus, thalamus, and brain stem.

The functions of this top-down modulation for human behavior are poorly understood. Here, we show that top-down modulation of the visual sensory thalamus (the lateral geniculate body, LGN) is involved in visual-speech recognition. In two independent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies, LGN response increased when participants processed fast-varying features of articulatory movements required for visual-speech recognition, as compared to temporally more stable features required for face identification with the same stimulus material. The LGN response during the visual-speech task correlated positively with the visual-speech recognition scores across participants. In addition, the task-dependent modulation was present for speech movements and did not occur for control conditions involving non-speech biological movements. In face-to-face communication, visual speech recognition is used to enhance or even enable understanding what is said. Speech recognition is commonly explained in frameworks focusing on cerebral cortex areas. Our findings suggest that task-dependent modulation at subcortical sensory stages has an important role for communication: Together with similar findings in the auditory modality the findings imply that task-dependent modulation of the sensory thalami is a general mechanism to optimize speech recognition.",Functional MRI; Lateral geniculate nucleus; Lipreading; Speech; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; CORTICOTHALAMIC FEEDBACK; MACAQUE MONKEY; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; CORTICOFUGAL MODULATION; AUDITORY-SYSTEM; HEARING LIPS; RESPONSES; FREQUENCY; ATTENTION

In the present study, adult pig-tailed macaques were infected with a highly neuropathogenic virus SIVsmmFGb. MT imaging was exploited to examine the monkey brains before simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) inoculation and 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 weeks post-SIV inoculation. Blood samples were collected from each animal for monitoring CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells before each MRI scan. The MT ratios (MTR) in several brain regions of interest were evaluated longitudinally. Significant reductions of MTR were observed in whole brain and selected regions of interest (genu, splenium, thalamus, caudate, centrum semiovale, frontal white matter, frontal gray matter, and putamen) in the SIV-infected monkeys, consistent with those reported previously in HIV patients. In particular, the longitudinal results indicate that abnormal MTR reduction can be detected as early as in 2 weeks and MTR may be more sensitive to the brain injury in cortical regions than in subcortical regions during acute SIV infection. In addition, MTR reduction in genu, centrum semiovale, and thalamus significantly correlated with the CD4(+) T cell percentage decrease. Also, the MTR reduction in thalamus correlated with the CD8(+) T cell percentage elevation. Taken together, this study reported the longitudinal evolution of MTR in different brain regions during SIV infection and further validates previous findings in HIV patients. The preliminary results suggest that MT imaging could be a robust and sensitive approach to characterize the neurodegeneration after SIV or HIV infection.",nan; SIMIAN IMMUNODEFICIENCY VIRUS; TISSUE-SPECIFIC COMPARTMENTALIZATION; WHOLE-BRAIN; TRANSFER CONTRAST; NEUROPATHOGENIC SIVSMMFGB; COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; GENETIC DIVERSITY; SIV INFECTION; WHITE-MATTER; HIV

Following dopaminergic denervation, pallidothalamic-projecting neurons are known to be hyperactive, whereas a reduction in GPi activity is typically observed in lesioned animals showing levodopa-induced dyskinesia. Besides the mRNAs coding for GABAergic markers (GAD65 and GAD67), we show that all GPi neurons innervating thalamic targets also express transcripts for the isoforms 1 and 2 of the vesicular glutamate transporter (vGlut1 and vGlut2 mRNA). Indeed, dual immunofluorescent detection of GAD67 and vGlut1/2 confirmed the data gathered from in situ hybridization experiments, therefore demonstrating that the detected mRNAs are translated into the related proteins. Furthermore, the dopaminergic lesion resulted in an up-regulation of expression levels for both GAD65 and GAD67 mRNA within identified pallidothalamic-projecting neurons. This was coupled with a down-regulation of GAD65/67 mRNA expression levels in GPi neurons innervating thalamic targets in monkeys showing levodopa-induced dyskinesia. By contrast, the patterns of gene expression for both vGlut1 and vGlut2 mRNAs remained unchanged across GPi projection neurons in control, MPTP-treated and dyskinetic monkeys. In summary, both GABAergic and glutamatergic markers were co-expressed by GPi efferent neurons in primates. Although the status of the dopaminergic system directly modulates the expression levels of GAD65/67 mRNA, the observed expression of vGlut1/2 mRNA is not regulated by either dopaminergic removal or by continuous stimulation with dopaminergic agonists.",Basal ganglia; Globus pallidus; Ventral thalamus; vGlut; GAD; GABA; Glutamate; Dyskinesia; Parkinson's disease; GLUTAMIC-ACID DECARBOXYLASE; MESSENGER-RNA LEVELS; SUBSTANCE-P-LIKE; ENTOPEDUNCULAR NUCLEUS; CHOLINE-ACETYLTRANSFERASE; DOPAMINERGIC TERMINALS; GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; FIBER TERMINALS; EXPRESSION; RAT

The main efferent projections from the globus pallidus are to the subthalamus, to the thalamus, and to the substantia nigra. Although these projections have been well established for the dorsal pallidum, the projections of the ventral pallidum have not been explored in primates. The results of this study add an important link in how information from the limbic lobe is channeled through the basal ganglia in monkeys. Anterograde tracers, Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin, and tritiated amino acids were injected into various regions of the ventral pallidum. The descending efferent projection from the ventral pallidum in monkeys terminates primarily in the subthalamic nucleus and adjacent lateral hypothalamus, in the substantia nigra, and in the lateral habenular nucleus. Although terminals are also found in the thalamus, these are relatively sparse. The projections to the subthalamic nucleus and the lateral hypothalamus are topographically arranged, while those to the substantia nigra are not. These results suggest that pathways from distinct pallidal regions that receive specific striatal input terminate in distinct regions of the subthalamic/hypothalamic regions, thus maintaining a topographic arrangement. Projections to the substantia nigra, however, overlap extensively, suggesting convergence of terminals from different ventral pallidal regions. The relatively small projection to the thalamus raises the question that without a prominent thalamic projection, is this system parallel to that described for the dorsal globus pallidus?",BASAL GANGLIA; SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; STRIATUM; THALAMUS; GLOBUS PALLIDUS; SUBSTANCE-P IMMUNOREACTIVITY; PRIMATE GLOBUS PALLIDUS; RHESUS-MONKEY; BASAL FOREBRAIN; EFFERENT CONNECTIONS; STRIATOPALLIDAL PARTS; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; MACACA-FASCICULARIS; PHA-L; CHOLINERGIC NEURONS

The two principal tactile processing areas in the cerebral cortex, somatosensory areas I and II, receive direct projections from the thalamus and, as well, are linked through intracortical reciprocal connections. Tactile information may therefore be conveyed to SII, for example, over either a direct path from the thalamus or an indirect, or serial, path from the thalamus via SI. 2. Reports in recent years that tactile responsiveness within the hand area of SII was abolished by surgical ablation of the hand area of the postcentral, or SI, area of cortex in the macaque and marmoset monkeys indicated that a serial processing scheme may operate, at least in primates. However, as the surgical ablation is clearly irreversible and precludes examination of individual SII neurons in both the control and test circumstances, that is, when SI is intact and when it is inactivated, we have examined in the cat, the rabbit and the marmoset monkey the behaviour of SII neurons before, during and after the selective, rapidly-reversible inactivation of SI by means of localized cooling. 3. The results demonstrate that in the cat and rabbit, SII responsiveness is never abolished and infrequently affected by SI inactivation and that tactile inputs to SII therefore traverse a direct path from thalamus, organized in parallel with that to SI. In the marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), in contrast to earlier studies based on ablation of SI we found that with reversible inactivation of SI, SII responsiveness was unaffected in 25% of neurons and, although reduced in the remainder, was rarely abolished (<10% of SII neurons). 4. The results indicate that there is substantial direct thalamic input to SII, even in this simian primate, and therefore necessitate revision of the hypothesis that tactile processing at the thalamocortical level in simian primates is based on a strict serial scheme in which tactile information is conveyed from the thalamus to SI and thence to SII.",cat; cerebral cortex; cutaneous; parallel processing; primate; sensory systems; serial processing; somatosensory cortex; tactile; CAT CEREBRAL-CORTEX; REVERSIBLE INACTIVATION; LATERAL SULCUS; 2ND; SII; INFORMATION; RESPONSES; MACAQUES; NEURONS; FIELDS

COMPARISON OF SPINE ACQUISITION AND DENDRITIC GROWTH OF LAYER-4C ALPHA-SPINY AND BETA-SPINY STELLATE NEURONS,"A quantitative study has been made from Golgi impregnations of the maturation of dendrites and their spines on spiny stellate neurons in the macaque monkey primary visual cortex. The neurons studied lay within either the alpha or the beta division of lamina 4C; previous workers have shown the alpha division neurons to be contacted by thalamic axon terminals arising from the magnocellular division of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus and the beta division neurons to be contacted by parvocellular LGN inputs. Most thalamic terminals and perhaps the majority of other type 1 (Colonnier, '81), presumed excitatory, inputs to these cells make synaptic contacts on the tips of their dendritic spines. Measurement was made of relative changes in the total number of spines on these alpha and beta spiny neurons over age by measuring both spine density along the dendrites and dendritic arbor size in single 90-mu-m sections from Golgi rapid preparations. Our previous work (Lund et al., '77; Boothe et al., '79) showed a marked proliferation and attrition of spines and dendritic branches to occur in the early postnatal weeks; Rakic et al. ('86) have since proposed that there is a cortexwide synchrony of synapse acquisition and loss during this same period. However, different visual capacities channelled via the magnocellular and parvicellular geniculate relays show different maturational rates (Harwerth et al., '86). This study indicates that the anatomical maturation of spines on the alpha and beta neurons is not temporally coincident from birth to 30 weeks. During this period, phases of spine acquisition and loss on alpha neurons precedes similar phases on beta neurons. The alpha neurons carry a peak spine population at 5-8 weeks postnatal, whereas the beta neurons carry their peak spine populations between 8 and 24 weeks postnatal. At all ages prior to 30 weeks, the two sets of neurons carry quite different total spine populations. Close to 30 weeks of age, the total spine coverage has fallen on both sets of neurons and becomes identical between the alpha and beta neurons. In animals aged 30 weeks to adult, spine coverage per neuron is maintained at a common figure for the alpha and beta neurons despite further growth and disparate dendritic arbor sizes and different local spine densities in the two groups; this suggests that some common sampling paradigm between pre- and postsynaptic elements is adopted by the alpha and beta neurons and also suggests the development of a close functional correlation between the two sets of neurons.",VISION; PRIMATE; DENDRITIC SPINE; CEREBRAL CORTEX; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; OCULAR DOMINANCE COLUMNS; VISUAL-CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; CONTRAST SENSITIVITY; MACACA-NEMESTRINA; AREA 17; GOLGI; CAT; SYNAPSES

Much of our understanding of the physiology of LGN neurons comes from data collected in anaesthetized animals. This study examines the visual responses of LGN neurons in alert animals and compares these responses to those from anaesthetized animals. Compared to the anaesthetized animal, LGN neurons in the alert animal respond to visual stimuli with stronger responses and follow stimuli drifting at higher spatial and temporal frequencies. Stronger responses are likely to translate into an increased coupling between the LGN and visual cortex, as firing rate and interspike interval are known to influence the dynamics of synaptic communication between the two structures. Abstract Despite the increasing use of alert animals for studies aimed at understanding visual processing in the cerebral cortex, relatively little attention has been focused on quantifying the response properties of neurons that provide input to the cortex. Here, we examine the response properties of neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus in the alert macaque monkey and compare these responses to those in the anaesthetized animal. Compared to the anaesthetized animal, we show that magnocellular and parvocellular neurons in the alert animal respond to visual stimuli with significantly higher firing rates. This increase in responsiveness is not accompanied by a change in the shape of neuronal contrast response functions or the strength of centre-surround antagonism; however, it is accompanied by an increased ability of neurons to follow stimuli drifting at higher spatial and temporal frequencies.",nan; THALAMIC RELAY CELLS; NEW-WORLD MONKEY; CONTRAST-SENSITIVITY; GENERAL-ANESTHETICS; PRIMATE RETINA; X-LIKE; NEURONS; CORTEX; CAT; MODES

Four of these cases were infants in which the injections revealed transient patterns of inputs to TE from various other brain regions. Although each monkey showed extensive label in the pulvinar nucleus and other subcortical structures, none showed unambiguous labelling in the dLGN.

We investigated the time-varying changes of the putaminal spiking activity and the spectral power of local field potentials (LFPs) during a task where the rhythmic tapping of monkeys was guided by isochronous stimuli separated by a fixed duration (synchronization phase), followed by a period of internally timed movements (continuation phase). We found that the power of both bands and the discharge rate of cells showed an orderly change in magnitude as a function of the duration and/or the serial order of the intervals executed rhythmically. More LFPs were tuned to duration and/or serial order in the beta-than the gamma-band, although different values of preferred features were represented by single cells and by both bands. Importantly, in the LFPs tuned to serial order, there was a strong bias toward the continuation phase for the beta-band when aligned to movements, and a bias toward the synchronization phase for the gamma-band when aligned to the stimuli. Our results suggest that gamma-oscillations reflect local computations associated with stimulus processing, whereas beta-activity involves the entrainment of large putaminal circuits, probably in conjunction with other elements of CBGT, during internally driven rhythmic tapping.",interval tuning; rhesus monkey; spikes and LFPs; synchronization-continuation task; timing; LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS OSCILLATIONS; BETA-BAND OSCILLATIONS; MONKEY MOTOR CORTEX; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; INTERVAL DISCRIMINATION; NEURAL REPRESENTATION; SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; TIME PERCEPTION; HAND MOVEMENT

Studies of incentive processing have repeatedly demonstrated activation of nucleus accumbens (NAc), thalamus, and anterior insula, three key components of reward neurocircuitry. The contribution of the thalamus to this circuitry in humans has been relatively ignored, a gap that needs to be filled, given the central role of this structure in processing and filtering information. This study aimed to understand how these three regions function as a network during gain or loss anticipation in adults and youth. Towards this goal, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and dynamic causal modeling (DCM) were used to examine effective connectivity among these three nodes in healthy adults and adolescents who performed the monetary incentive delay (MID) task. Seven connectivity models, based on anatomic connections, were tested. They were estimated for incentive anticipation and underwent Bayesian Model Selection (BMS) to determine the best-fit model for each adult and adolescent group. Connection strengths were extracted from the best-fit model and examined for significance in each group. These variables were then entered into a linear mixed model to test between-group effects on effective connectivity in reward neurocircuitry. The best-fit model for both groups included all possible anatomic connections. Three main findings emerged: (1) Across the task, thalamus and insula significantly influenced NAc; (2) A broader set of significant connections was found for the loss-cue condition than the gain-cue condition in both groups; (3) Finally, between-group comparisons of connectivity strength failed to detect statistical differences, suggesting that adults and adolescents use this incentive-processing network in a similar manner. This study demonstrates the way in which the thalamus and insula influence the NAc during incentive processing in humans. Specifically, this is the first study to demonstrate in humans the key role of thalamus projections onto the NAc in support of reward processing. Our results suggest that anticipation of gain/loss involves an 'alerting' signal (thalamus) that converges with interoceptive information (insula) to shape action selection programs in the ventral striatum.

Eleven aged animals, 21-26-years old, were included in the analysis. Regional CMRglc, normalized to values for the entire brain, were determined for the dorsal prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, hippocampus, and temporal cortex. The aged animals exhibited significant DR deficits relative to a cohort of normal young monkeys. Variability in DR performance among the aged subjects was significantly correlated with relative hippocampal rCMRglc, and chronological age was a reliable predictor of orbitofrontal rCMRglc ratios. This pattern of results suggests that DR impairments in the aged monkey may partly reflect ape-related dysfunction distributed among multiple limbic system structures that participate in normal learning and memory. Overall, the findings support the use of positron emission tomography in efforts to define the relationship between cognitive performance, age, and brain physiology in nonhuman primates.

In the present study, we report that the expression of occ1 mRNA in the macaque neocortex can be classified into two modes. The first mode is associated with excitatory neurons distributed in the major thalamocortical recipient layers that exhibit strong cytochrome oxidase activity. This is highly prominent in V1. The second mode is associated with parvalbumin-positive GABAergic interneurons and is distributed across the macaque neocortex, In V1, monocular deprivation showed that occ1 mRNA expression in excitatory neurons was markedly dependent on afferent activity, whereas that in GABAergic interneurons was not. Cross-species comparison showed specific differences in expression. In marmosets, a strong expression was observed in V1 similarly to macaques. The occ1 mRNA expression, however, was generally weak in the mouse neocortex. In rabbit and ferret cortices, the strong expression was observed only in GABAergic interneurons. We conclude that activity-dependent occ1 mRNA expression in the excitatory neurons of V1 was caused by a novel mechanism acquired by primates after their separation from other lineages.",brain evolution; in situ hybridization; Macaca fuscata; TSC-36; V1-specific; CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEINS; LOCAL CIRCUIT NEURONS; CYTOCHROME-OXIDASE; GENE-EXPRESSION; GABAERGIC NEURONS; CALBINDIN D-28K; CHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS; SYNAPTIC CONNECTIONS; FOLLISTATIN-LIKE; MONKEY

Pie describe the brain, heart, and skeletal muscle lesions, review lesions described in literature, and discuss possible pharmacologic mechanisms for soman-induced neuron necrosis. Methods: In this retrospective, histopathologic study, records were obtained for 36 rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) that were euthanized 10 days after soman exposure, from a larger group of 103 monkeys that were exposed to soman and used for pharmacologic and lethality studies. Results: Brain lesions were seen in 9 of 15 animals that convulsed and in only 1 of 21 that did not convulse. The brain lesions in our primates were limited to the hippocampus, amygdala, and thalamus (of one animal), and consisted of neuron necrosis and dropout, spongiosis, gliosis, astrocytosis, and vascularization, Heart lesions consisted of myocardial degeneration and necrosis. Three animals had brain and heart lesions, 7 had brain lesions only, and 3 had heart Lesions only. Skeletal muscle lesions, although minimal to mild, were in most of the animals, whether they had convulsed, but most had muscular tremors. These lesions were in the biceps brachii (11 of 22 monkeys), anterior tibialis (8/22), biceps femoris (7/22), flexor carpi radialis (5/22), gastrocnemius (3/22), and diaphragm (1/22). The limited literature on soman lesions in primate brain and heart, and the limited information on skeletal muscle lesions, is reviewed. Conclusions: Brain lesions were not as wide-spread as reported in other studies of primates and rodents, and were significantly associated with convulsions. Unlike other studies using rodents, we observed poor correlation between heart and brain lesions; thus, a single hypothesis to explain the pathogenesis for the brain and heart lesions may be difficult to establish.",nan; INDUCED SEIZURES; RAT; NEUROPATHOLOGY; HIPPOCAMPUS; MECHANISMS; MEMANTINE; PRIMATES; DAMAGE

Differentiation of the pontine sensory syndrome from the thalamic sensory syndrome has generally been made on the basis of distribution of sensory loss and involvement of specific sensory modalities but not without uncertainties and difficulties. Because the pontine tegmentum plays a pivotal role in generating horizontal eye movement, we attempted to discriminate these 2 syndromes by analyzing horizontal eye movements in stroke patients with pure hemisensory syndrome. Methods-Horizontal saccade, pursuit, vestibule-ocular reflex (VOR), and VOR cancellation (VORC) were evaluated using electro-oculography in 6 patients with hemisensory syndromes, 3 due to pontine stroke and 3 due to thalamic stroke, and all were verified by MRI or CT. In addition, somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) were recorded. Results-Smooth pursuit and VORC directed toward the side of the lesion were impaired unilaterally in patients with pontine sensory stroke, whereas those 2 movements were intact bilaterally in patients with thalamic sensory stroke. Saccade and VOR were preserved in all patients. SEPs were normal in all patients with pontine and thalamic sensory strokes.

Interpretations of available data have led to opposing 'information funneling' and 'parallel processing' hypotheses. Using motor circuit as a model, we examined whether cortico-subcortical circuits, especially cortico-basal ganglia circuits, are funneled or parallel in the control of volitional movement. Twenty-five healthy subjects underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Activated clusters during self-initiated, sequential finger-to-thumb opposition movements of the left hand were identified in the bilateral supplementary motor area (SMA), right lateral premotor cortex (PM) and primary motor cortex (M1), and in the right striatum and thalamus. These functionally defined clusters were applied to probabilistic tractography based on diffusion-weighted MRI to examine patterns of connectivity. Striatal and thalamic sub-regions with high probabilities of connection to the motor cortices partially overlapped, with connection to the two premotor areas outspreading rostrally relative to M1. We suggest that, on a macroscopic anatomical level, there is overlap as well as segregation among connections of the motor cortices with the striatum and thalamus. This supports the notion that neuronal information of the motor cortices is funneled, and parallel processing is not an exclusive principle in the basal ganglia. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Focusing on a wiring diagram that spans the cortex, basal ganglia, and thalamus of the macaque brain, we identify robust modules in the network that provide a mesoscopic-level description of its topological architecture. Surprisingly, we find that the modular architecture facilitates rapid communication across the network, instead of localizing activity as is typically expected in networks having community organization. By considering processes of diffusive spreading and coordination, we demonstrate that the specific pattern of inter-and intramodular connectivity in the network allows propagation to be even faster than equivalent randomized networks with or without modular structure. This pattern of connectivity is seen at different scales and is conserved across principal cortical divisions, as well as subcortical structures. Furthermore, we find that the physical proximity between areas is insufficient to explain the modular organization, as similar mesoscopic structures can be obtained even after factoring out the effect of distance constraints on the connectivity. By supplementing the topological information about the macaque connectome with physical locations, volumes, and functions of the constituent areas and analyzing this augmented dataset, we reveal a counterintuitive role played by the modular architecture of the brain in promoting global coordination of its activity. It suggests a possible explanation for the ubiquity of modularity in brain networks.",nan; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; PARIETAL CORTEX; CORTICOCORTICAL CONNECTIONS; COMMUNITY STRUCTURE; DECISION-MAKING; VISUAL PATHWAYS; NEURAL-NETWORKS; WORKING-MEMORY; ORGANIZATION; MONKEY

However, little is known about how prenatal perturbation translates into adult brain dysfunction. Here, we use a longitudinal study design to examine the effects of disruption of early gestational neurogenesis on brain volume in the non-human primate. Methods and Principal Findings: Five Rhesus macaques were exposed to x-irradiation in early gestation (E30-E41), and four control monkeys were sham-irradiated at comparable ages. Whole brain magnetic resonance imaging was performed at 6 months, 12 months, and 3 and 5 years of age. Volumes of whole cerebrum, cortical gray matter, caudate, putamen, and thalamus were estimated using semi-automated segmentation methods and high dimensional brain mapping. Volume reductions spanning all ages were observed in irradiated monkeys in the putamen (15-24%, p = 0.01) and in cortical gray matter (6-15%, p = 0.01). Upon covarying for whole cerebral volume, group differences were reduced to trend levels (putamen: p = 0.07; cortical gray matter: p = 0.08). No group-by-age effects were significant. Conclusions: Due to the small number of observations, the conclusions drawn from this study must be viewed as tentative. Early gestational irradiation may result in non-uniform reduction of gray matter, mainly affecting the putamen and cerebral cortex. This may be relevant to understanding how early prenatal environmental insult could lead to brain morphological differences in neurodevelopmental diseases.",nan; DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; PRIMATE VISUAL-CORTEX; PRENATAL EXPOSURE; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; SCHIZOPHRENIA; RISK; MRI; NEURONS

We now describe the presence and distribution of the PTH2R and TIP39 in the brain of primates using a range of tissues and ages from macaque and human brain. In situ hybridization histochemistry of TIP39 mRNA, studied in young macaque brain, due to its possible decline beyond late postnatal ages, was present only in the thalamic subparafascicular area and the pontine medial paralemniscal nucleus. In contrast, in situ hybridization histochemistry in macaque identified high levels of PTH2R expression in the central amygdaloid nucleus, medial preoptic area, hypothalamic paraventricular and periventricular nuclei, medial geniculate, and the Pontine tegmentum. PTH2R mRNA was also detected in several human brain areas by RT-PCR. The distribution of PTH2R-immunoreactive fibers in human, determined by immunocytochemistry, was similar to that in rodents, including dense fiber networks in the medial preoptic area, hypothalamic paraventricular, periventricular and infundibular (arcuate) nuclei, lateral hypothalamic area, median eminence, thalamic paraventricular nucleus, periaqueductal gray, lateral parabrachial nucleus, nucleus of the solitary tract, sensory trigeminal nuclei, medullary dorsal reticular nucleus, and dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Co-localization suggested that PTH2R fibers are glutamatergic, and that TIP39 may directly influence hypophysiotropic somatostatin containing and indirectly influence corticotropin releasing-hormone containing neurons. The results demonstrate that TIP39 and the PTH2R are expressed in the brain of primates in locations that suggest involvement in regulation of fear, anxiety, reproductive behaviors, release of pituitary hormones, and nociception.

In this review, we summarize recent findings where molecular biological techniques have revealed a small number of area-specific genes in the nonhuman primate cortex. One of these (occl) is strongly expressed in primary visual cortex and is associated with thalamocortical connections. Another gene, RBP, is more strongly expressed in association areas. It is not clear whether RBP might be linked with any particular connectional system, but several possibilities are raised. We also discuss possible roles of area-specific genes in postnatal development, and conclude with a brief sketch of future directions.

Different types of layer 6 pyramidal neurons provide output to different thalamic nuclei, and it is therefore of interest to understand the sources of functional input to these neurons. We studied the morphologies and local excitatory input to individual layer 6 neurons in rat visual cortex by combining intracellular labeling and recording with laser-scanning photostimulation. As in previous photostimulation studies, we found significant differences in the sources of local excitatory input to different cell types. Most notably, there were differences in local input to neurons that, based on analogy to barrel cortex, are likely to project only to the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus versus those that are likely to also project to the lateral posterior nucleus. The more striking finding, however, was the paucity of superficial layer input to layer 6 neurons in the rat visual cortex, contrasting sharply with layer 6 neurons in the primate visual cortex. These observations provide insight into differences in function between cortical projections to first-order versus higher-order thalamic nuclei and also show that these circuits can be organized differently in different species.",nan; MACAQUE MONKEY; PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; MAMMALIAN BRAINS; AREA 17; PROJECTIONS; ORGANIZATION; PATHWAYS; INPUT; CELLS; PHOTOSTIMULATION

Synthesis and Biological Evaluation of 3-(2-(S)-3,4-dehydropyrrolinyl methoxy)-5-(3 '-F-18-Fluoropropyl)pyridine (F-18-Nifrolene) using PET","Imaging agents for nicotinic alpha 4 beta 2 receptors in the brain have been under way for studying various CNS disorders. Previous studies from our laboratories have reported the successful development of agonist, F-18-nifene. In attempts to develop potential antagonists, F-18-nifrolidine and F-18-nifzetidine were previously reported. Further optimization of these fluoropropyl derivatives has now been carried out resulting in 3-(2-(S)-3,4-dehydropyrrolinylmethoxy)-5-(3'-Fluoropropyl)pyridine (nifrolene) as a new high affinity agent for nicotinic alpha 4 beta 2 receptors. Nifrolene in rat brain homogenate assays - labeled with H-3-cytisine - exhibited a binding affinity of 0.36 nM. The fluorine-18 analog. F-18-nifrolene, was synthesized in approximately 10%-20% yield and specific activity was estimated to be >2000 Ci/mmol. Rat brain slices indicated selective binding to anterior thalamic nuclei, thalamus, subiculum, striata, cortex and other regions consistent with AN receptor distribution. This selective binding was displaced >90% by 300 mu M nicotine. Thalamus to cerebellum ratio (>10) was the highest for F-18-nifrolene with several other regions showing selective binding. In vivo rat PET studies exhibited rapid uptake of F-18-nifrolene in the brain with specific retention in the thalamus and other brain regions while clearing out from the cerebellum. Thalamus to cerebellum ratio value in the rat was >4. Administration of nicotine caused a rapid decline in the thalamic 18F-nifrolene suggesting reversible binding to nicotinic receptors. PET imaging studies of F-18-nifrolene in anesthetized rhesus monkey revealed highest binding in the thalamus followed by regions of the lateral cingulated and temporal cortex. Cerebellum showed the least binding. Thalamus to cerebellum ratio in the monkey brain was >3 at 120 min. These ratios of F-18-nifrolene are higher than measured for F-18-nifrolidine and F-18-nifzetidine. F-18-Nifrolene thus shows promise as a new PET imaging agent for alpha 4 beta 2 nAChR.

In this study, to explore potential anatomical bases for these neuronal activities, we injected retrograde tracers (CTB-Alexa-488 and CTB-gold) into the dorsal bank of the anterior cingulate sulcus and examined the distribution of labeled cell bodies in macaque monkey brains. The Nissl staining showed that the cortex in the dorsal bank of the anterior cingulate sulcus has consistent layer 4 which means that the cortical region is a part of the granular prefrontal cortex. The injection site belonged to the sulcal portion of area 9m in two cases and the sulcal portion of area 8Bm in one case. In addition to the continuous distribution of labeled cells in the two areas (areas 9m and 8Bm) around the injection site, the labeled cells were densely distributed in the cingulate areas (areas 24, 32, and 23) in all the cases. The dense labeling of cells was also found in other prefrontal areas (areas 46, 10, 11, and 12) in the two cases with injection into the sulcal portion of area 9m, whereas the dense labeling of cells was found in pre-motor areas (F6 and F7) in the case with injection into the sulcal portion of area 8Bm. The dense labeling of cells in the prefrontal and premotor areas was more similar to those previously found after injections into dorsal parts of areas 9 and 8B.

Its therapeutic effect may depend on its ability to enter the brain and bind to the oxytocin receptor. To date, the brain tissue penetrance of intranasal oxytocin has not been demonstrated. In this nonhuman primate study, we administer deuterated oxytocin intranasally and intravenously to rhesus macaques and measure, with mass spectrometry, concentrations of labeled (exogenously administered) and endogenous oxytocin in 12 brain regions two hours after oxytocin administration. Labeled oxytocin is quantified after intranasal (not intravenous) administration in brain regions (orbitofrontal cortex, striatum, brainstem, and thalamus) that lie in the trajectories of the olfactory and trigeminal nerves. These results suggest that intranasal administration bypasses the blood-brain barrier, delivering oxytocin to specific brain regions, such as the striatum, where oxytocin acts to impact motivated behaviors. Further, high concentrations of endogenous oxytocin are in regions that overlap with projection fields of oxytocinergic neurons. The location and extent of intranasal oxytocin brain penetrance has not been shown. Here the authors show that oxytocin, administered intranasally, enters brain regions along the trajectories of the olfactory and trigeminal nerves and there, reaches biologically relevant concentrations.",nan; MIDBRAIN DOPAMINE; ANIMAL-MODELS; DELIVERY; RELEASE; DRUG; SYSTEM; TISSUES; NASAL

SIV infected model for detecting the neurological changes with progression was studied. Methods: In the study, six rhesus macaques infected by simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) were scanned by resting-state fMRI at the following time points: before SIV inoculation (baseline), 12 weeks and 24 weeks post inoculation (12 wpi, 24 wpi). Meanwhile, the immunological parameters including serum percentage of CD4+ T cell, CD4/CD8 ratio and absolute CD4+ T cell number were measured and analyzed. Results: In comparison of baseline, significant decreased ReHo was found in the left superior frontal gyrus, left superior temporal gyrus, left hippocampus, right precuneus, left angular gyrus, and bilateral occipital gyrus; in contrast increased ReHo in putamen at 12 wpi. Moreover, at the time of 24 wpi, decreased ReHo was observed in the right postcentral gyrus, left precentral gyrus, posterior cingulated gyrus and thalamus, while ReHo was increased in the left putamen, hippocampus, left anterior cingulated cortex and precentral cortex. The correlation analysis revealed that ReHo in the superior frontal gyrus showed negative association with CD4/CD8 ratio and positive with absolute CD4+ T cell number. The correlation analysis showed that percentage of CD4+ was correlated with the ReHo values in right middle frontal gyrus, bilateral thalamus and amygdala positively; negative relationship with left putamen, left superior frontal gyrus, left superior and middle temporal gyrus. Conclusion: The study first indicates that hippocampus, putamen, frontal and occipital lobe were impaired by using rs-fMRI and correlated with immunological parameters. Thus, ReHo value can be utilized as a noninvasive biomarker of spontaneous brain activity changes caused by the progression of neurological impairments. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Relative involvements of neurochemically distinct subterritories in the ventral pallidum and adjacent parts of the rostroventral forebrain,"Retrograde and anterograde tract-tracing studies were carried out to determine whether the capacity of the nucleus accumbens to influence the thalamic mediodorsal nucleus via ventral striatopallidothalamic connections disproportionately favors the shell over the core subterritory. After injections of Fluoro-Gold into the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus, retrogradely labeled neurons were detected in sections also processed for calbindin-D 28-kD and neurotensin immunoreactivities to facilitate identification of subterritories in the ventral pallidum. Fluoro-Gold-labeled cells were counted in series of sections cut through the ventral pallidum, rostral globus pallidus, nucleus of the vertical limb of the diagonal band, preoptic region, lateral hypothalamus, and the sublenticular gray region, including parts of the extended amygdala. Data were expressed as cells/unit area and as percentages of all labeled forebrain cells. Mediodorsal nucleus-projecting rostroventral forebrain neurons were most numerous in the ventromedial part of the subcommissural ventral pallidum and pallidal parts of the olfactory tubercle. Few were observed in the dorsolateral part of the subcommissural ventral pallidum. In addition, following injections into the ventral pallidum, anterogradely transported biotinylated dextran amine was evaluated in sections processed for calbindin or tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivities. Injection into the ventromedial part of the subcommissural ventral pallidum resulted in robust anterograde labeling of the medial segment of the mediodorsal nucleus and ventral tegmental area and weak labeling of the substantia nigra and subthalamic nucleus. Conversely, after injection into the dorsolateral part of the subcommissural ventral pallidum, anterograde labeling was weak in the mediodorsal nucleus and ventral tegmental area, but robust in the substantia nigra and subthalamic nucleus. The results are consistent with a predominant accumbens shell influence on the mediodorsal nucleus and with cortico-ventral striatopallidal-thalamocortical pathways that begin and end in different parts of the frontal lobe.

Much is known about the adaptive effects of constant stimulation over prolonged periods. However, there are open questions regarding adaptation to stimuli that are changing over time, interrupted, or repeated. Feature-specific adaptation to repeating stimuli has been shown to occur as early as primary visual cortex (V1), but there is also evidence for more generalized, fatigue-like adaptation that might occur at an earlier stage of processing. Here, we show adaptation in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of awake, fixating monkeys following brief (1 s) exposure to repeated cycles of a 4-Hz drifting grating. We examined the relative change of each neuron's response across successive (repeated) grating cycles. We found that neurons from all cell classes (parvocellular, magnocellular, and koniocellular) showed significant adaptation. However, only magnocellular neurons showed adaptation when responses were averaged to a population response. In contrast to firing rates, response variability was largely unaffected. Finally, adaptation was comparable between monocular and binocular stimulation, suggesting that rapid LGN adaptation is monocular in nature. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Neural adaptation can be defined as reduction of spiking responses following repeated or prolonged stimulation. Adaptation helps adjust neural responsiveness to avoid saturation and has been suggested to improve perceptual selectivity, information transmission, and predictive coding.

Neuropathological examination revealed glial fibrillary tangles (GPTs) mainly distributed in the putamen, caudate nucleus. thalamic nuclei, substantia nigra, red nucleus. globus pallidus, trapezoid body, pyramid, pens and medulla oblongata of the brain, and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in the thalamic nuclei. These structures were positively stained by the modified Gallyas-Braak (GB) method and immunostained for tau. The tau-positive argyrophilic GFTs were morphologically classified into four types, as in human cases. i.e.. tufts of abnormal fibers (TAFs), thorn-shaped astrocytes (TSAs). glial coiled bodies (GCBs) and argyrophilic threads (ATs) depending on their GB profiles, and GCBs were the major structures in this case. Some of these structures were also immunoreactive for alpha-synuclein. The glial cells possessing the structures were negative for glial fibrillary acidic protein. a marker for astrocytes, indicating that the argyrophilic GFTs were present in oligodendroglia. In addition, marked neuronal loss and ubiquitin-positive spheroid bodies were observed in the substantia nigra and globus pallidus. According to the characteristic distribution of the argyrophilic structures in neurons and glial cells as well as clinical signs, the monkey might have suffered from a neurodegenerative disease such as progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP).

To address this issue, we analyzed the distribution patterns of cortico-striatal and cortico-brainstem axon terminals and the origin of thalamocortical and intracortical fibers by injecting anterograde/ retrograde tracers into physiologically and morphologically defined jaw movement-related cortical areas. Four areas were identified in the macaque monkey: the primary and supplementary orofacial motor areas (MIoro and SMAoro) and the principal and deep parts of the cortical masticatory area (CMaAp and CMaAd), where intracortical microstimulation produced single twitch-like or rhythmic jaw movements, respectively. Tracer injections into these areas labeled terminals in the ipsilateral putamen in a topographic fashion (MIoro vs. SMAoro and CMaAp vs. CMaAd), in the lateral reticular formation and trigeminal sensory nuclei contralaterally (MIoro and CMaAp) or bilaterally (SMAoro) in a complex manner of segregation vs. overlap, and in the medial parabranchial and Kolliker-Fuse nuclei contralaterally (CMaAd). The MIoro and CMaAp received thalamic projections from the ventrolateral and ventroposterolateral nuclei, the SMAoro from the ventroanterior and ventrolateral nuclei, and the CMaAd from the ventroposteromedial nucleus. The MIoro, SMAoro, CMaAp, and CMaAd received intracortical projections from the ventral premotor cortex and primary somatosensory cortex, the ventral premotor cortex and rostral cingulate motor area, the ventral premotor cortex and area 7b, and various sensory areas. In addition, the MIoro and CMaAp received projections from the three other jaw movement-related areas. Our results suggest that the four jaw movement-related cortical areas may play important roles in the formation of distinctive masticatory patterns.",mastication; basal ganglia; striatum; lateral tegmental field; trigeminal premotor neuron; thalamus; SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA; NIGRA PARS RETICULATA; OLD-WORLD MONKEY; LOWER BRAIN-STEM; ADJACENT CINGULATE CORTEX; CORTICAL MASTICATORY AREA; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MUSCLE-SPINDLE AFFERENTS; VENTRAL PREMOTOR CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY

Ten healthy human volunteers underwent brain scan examinations by functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during two optic flow experiments. In addition to the classical LGN-V1-hMT + pathway, our results showed a significant direct influence of the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal recorded in LGN over that in hMT +, not mediated by V1 activity, which strongly supports the existence of a bilateral pathway that connects LGN directly to hMT + and serves visual motion processing. Furthermore, we evaluated the relative latencies among areas functionally connected in the processing of visual motion. Using LGN as a reference region, hMT + exhibited a statistically significant earlier peak of activation as compared to V1. In conclusion, our findings suggest the co-existence of an alternative route that directly links LGN to hMT +, bypassing V1. This direct pathway may play a significant functional role for the faster detection of motion and may contribute to explain persistence of unconscious motion detection in individuals with severe destruction of primary visual cortex (blindsight).

We have developed pain models for cynomolgus macaques because it is more compatible with humans in regard to the structures and functions of brain regions which is suggested to be involved in pain in humans. Aside from humans, the cynomolgus macaques are the most widespread primate genus, ranging from Japan to North Africa. Since the macaques are the animal species closest to humans among those which can be used for invasive experiments, they are widely used to understand the mechanisms of the human brain. The purpose of this study is to elucidate pain-related brain activation regions in the macaque models using fMRI. Generally, pain testing in animal models has been based on avoidance behavior against pain stimuli. However, we identified pain-related brain activation regions using fMRI under propofol anesthesia as a more objective evaluation method. In the macaque model of chymopapain-induced discogenic low back pain, the activity of the insular cortex occurred in response to lumbar compression stimulation. In the macaque model of oxaliplatin-induced neuropathic cold hypersensitivity, activation of the insular cortex also occurred in response to cold stimuli. As a result of evaluating pregabalin, duloxetine and tramadol, only duloxetine showed behavioral effectiveness and suppressed activation of the insular cortex due to oxaliplatin-induced neuropathic pain. In the macaque model of postoperative pain, activation of the insula cortex was mainly activated by pressure stimulation. As a result of evaluating morphine, pregabalin and diclofenac, only morphine showed behavioral effectiveness and suppressed activation of the insular cortex due to postoperative pain. However, macaques with naturally occurring endometriosis exhibited a pain response against pressure stimuli to the abdomen, and had activation of the thalamus. As a result of evaluating morphine, meloxicam and acetaminophen, only morphine showed behavioral effectiveness and suppressed activation of thalamus due to abdominal pain from endometriosis. It was suggested that the brain activation regions could change due to various conditions that can cause the pain, as the acute pain increased activation in the insula cortex and the chronic pain increased activation in the thalamus. This study demonstrated the usefulness of fMRI as a pain biomarker, and fMRI analysis using the macaques might provide an advantage for the translation of the findings to human patients. Therefore, these study will contribute to the development of new analgesics for each pain as well as to the progress in the areas of brain research.",Thalamus; Insula cortex; Nonhuman primate; Brain activation; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; LOW-BACK-PAIN

Although its anatomy is well known, in particular thanks to studies in non-human primates, its role in perception and cognition remains poorly understood. Here, we used resting-state functional connectivity from a large sample of high-resolution data provided by the Human Connectome Project, combined with a large-scale meta-analysis approach to segregate and characterize the functional organization of the pulvinar nucleus. We identified five clusters per pulvinar with distinct connectivity profiles and determined their respective coactivation patterns. Using the Neurosynth database, we then investigated the functional significance of these co-activation networks. Our results confirm the functional heterogeneity of the pulvinar, revealing clearcut differences across clusters in terms of their connectivity patterns and associated cognitive domains. While the anterior and lateral clusters appear to be involved in action and attention domains, the ventromedial and dorsomedial clusters may preferentially subserve emotional processes and saliency detection. In contrast, the inferior cluster shows less specificity but correlates with perception and memory processes. Collectively, our results suggest that the pulvinar underwrites different components of cognition, supporting a central role in the coordination of cortico-subcortical processes mediated by distributed brain networks.",Pulvinar; Thalamo-cortical circuit; Connectivity; Parcellation; Meta-analysis; RESTING-STATE FMRI; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; INFERIOR PULVINAR; CORTICAL PROJECTIONS; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; MACAQUE MONKEY; HUMAN BRAIN; ORGANIZATION; PARCELLATION; INFORMATION

Methods: In situ hybridization and quantitative image analysis was used to measure mRNAs coding for CRH in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and thalamic center median-subfascicular complex (CM-Sf). Then, CRH neurons in the PVN were immunostained and the area of immunostaining was measured. Also, CRH fibers were immunostained in the central nucleus of the amygdala and the area of immunostaining was obtained. Finally, POMC mRNA expression was characterized in the hypothalamic infundibular nucleus. The groups were compared with ANOVA and Student-Newman-Keul's (SNK) post hoc comparison. Results: CRH mRNA was significantly elevated in the caudal PVN in the MSR and SS animals compared to HSR animals (p < 0.05, SNK). There was a significant increase in average and total CRH-positive area in the MSR and SS groups compared to the HSR group (p < 0.05, SNK). There was also a significant increase in CRH volume in the MSR and SS groups compared to the HSR group (p < 0.05, SNK). In the CM-Sf, the average CRH optical density was significantly higher in the MSR and SS groups than in the HSR group (p < 0.05, SNK). In the central nucleus of the amygdala, the area of CRH fiber staining was significantly higher in the SS group than in the MSR or HSR groups (p < 0.05, SNK). There was no difference between the groups in POMC mRNA expression in the mediobasal hypothalamus. Conclusion: Macaques that exhibit immediate suppression of reproductive function upon stress are considered stress sensitive. These animals have elevated CRH in the hypothalamus and limbic structures, which may play a role in suppressing the hypothalamic-gonadal axis upon stress initiation. Copyright (C) 2007 S.

The analyses herein tested whether abnormalities of volumes of brain structures forming nodes of these separate feed-forward and feedback systems are selectively related to each other and whether any of these noncortical regions can account for cognitive and motor deficits occurring as sequelae of chronic alcoholism. Methods: Regional brain measures originated from our prior neuroimaging studies, showing in alcoholics significant volume deficits in the principal structures of interest: cerebellar hemispheres, vermis, pons, and thalamus as well as prefrontal, frontal, and parietal cortex. Neuropsychological functions targeted for analysis-problem solving, visuospatial ability, and static postural stability-showed 0.6 to 1.6 SD deficits in these alcoholic men. Results: In alcoholics, the patterns of correlations were consistent with dissociation of thalamic and pontine circuitry. Pontine and thalamic volumes were not correlated with each other. Pontine volumes correlated with white matter volumes of anterior superior vermis and gray and white matter volumes of the cerebellar hemispheres but not with cortical regional volumes. Thalamic volumes correlated with gray matter volumes of the cerebellar hemispheres, parietal cortex, and inferior posterior vermian lobule, which itself correlated with parietal, prefrontal, and frontal cortical volumes. Controls did not show these correlational patterns. Brain structure-function relationships in alcoholics examined with multiple regression identified anterior vermian but not prefrontal or parietal volume as a unique predictor of balance scores; vermian and thalamic but not prefrontal cortical volumes as predictors of card sorting scores; and cerebellar hemispheric white matter but not parietal cortical volume as a predictor of visuospatial ability. Conclusions: Each major node of frontocerebellar circuitry shows volume deficits in alcoholics but can be independently compromised. Disruption of these circuits may underlie alcohol ism-related neuropsychological deficits, either by abnormalities present in individual nodes or by disconnection via interruption of selective circuitry.",cerebellum; frontal lobes; alcohol; brain circuit; thalamus; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY; CENTRAL PONTINE MYELINOLYSIS; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; CORTICAL GRAY-MATTER; CEREBELLAR VERMIS; RHESUS-MONKEY; WHITE-MATTER; ABSTINENT ALCOHOLICS; LOCUS-COERULEUS; MAMMILLARY BODY

The pulvinar is thought to modulate information flow between cortical areas, and has been implicated in cognitive tasks like directing visually guided actions. In order to better understand the underlying circuitry, we performed retrograde injections of modified rabies virus in the visual cortex and pulvinar of the Long-Evans rat. We found a relatively small population of cells projecting to primary visual cortex (V1), compared to a much larger population projecting to higher visual cortex.

Reconstructions of labeled terminals and their beaded varicosities in the neostriatum and thalamus were analyzed quantitatively to determine the degree of labeled overlap in both of these subcortical structures. Corticostriatal projections from the vibrissal representation in MI were more extensive than corresponding projections from SI. Both cortical areas sent dense projections to the dorsolateral neostriatum, but the MI vibrissal representation also projected to regions located more rostrally and medially. Despite these differences, both MI and Sl projected to overlapping parts of the dorsolateral neostriatum. Tracer injections in both cortical areas also produced dense anterograde and retrograde labeling in the medial sector of the posterior complex of the thalamus (POm). Because POm is somatotopically organized and has reciprocal. connections with both Sl and MI cortices, the amount of labeled overlap in POm was used to indicate whether the tracers were injected into corresponding whisker representations of MI and SI. We found that the proportion of labeled overlap in the neostriatum was highly correlated with the amount of labeled overlap in POm. These results indicate that the rodent neostriatum receives convergent projections from corresponding regions in MI and SI cortex. Furthermore, the thalamocortical projections of the POm indicate that it may modulate corticostriatal outputs from corresponding representations in MI and SI.

Despite the systemic impact of hypoxia-ischaemia, the resulting brain damage was previously reported to be largely limited to the hippocampus. However, the thalamus and the mammillary bodies are parts of the hippocampal-diencephalic network and are, therefore also at risk of injury following hypoxic-ischaemic events. Here, we report a neuroimaging investigation of diencephalic damage in a group of 18 patients with DA (age range 11-35 years), and an equal number of controls. Importantly, we uncovered a marked degree of atrophy in the mammillary bodies in two thirds of our patients. In addition, as a group, patients had mildly reduced thalamic volumes. The size of the anterior-mid thalamic (AMT) segment was correlated with patients' visual memory performance. Thus, in addition to the hippocampus, the diencephalic structures also appear to play a role in the patients' memory deficit. (C) 2016 The Authors.

NR3A is a recently identified unique modulatory subunit that decreases NMDA receptor current and calcium influx. In rodents, NR3A is developmentally expressed, displaying robust expression early in development that declines with age, reaching low levels in the adult brain. A distinct and highly selective pattern of expression is observed in the developing and mature rodent brain, suggesting that NR3A may play a very specific role in NMDA receptor-mediated processes. NR3A expression in other species, however, is unknown. Therefore, we examined the expression of NR3A mRNA and protein in the adult macaque brain. Our results indicate that NR3A mRNA is expressed throughout much of the adult primate brain, and at high levels in specific brain regions including the neocortex, substantia nigra par compacta and cerebellum, as well as select areas of the hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus and hypothamalamus. Western blot analysis reflects that this protein is translated and expressed in multiple brain regions. In contrast to the rat mRNA, our results suggest that NR3A transcript is widely expressed in the adult primate brain. Particular enrichment in some brain areas may reflect brain-region or circuit-specific functions for this NMDA receptor subunit. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Gradient-echo (GE) and spin-echo images were acquired with proton-density, T-1 and T-2(*) weightings. Five GE images with increased susceptibility effects were generated using a GESFID sequence, from which T-2* maps were also reconstructed. The first echo of the GESFID sequence (TE = 12.6 ms) produced the best contrast-to-noise ratio (CIN) between the pallidium and the putamen, the pallidium and the thalamus, the substantia nigra and the surrounding white matter, and the substantia nigra and the subthalamic nucleus. An increased T-2*-weighting (TE = 37.2 ms) was necessary to maximize C/N between the putamen and the surrounding white matter, and between the subthalamic nucleus and the surrounding white matter. A dual GE sequence with a short TE ( approximate to 10 ms) and a longer one (approximate to 30 ms) thus effectively localizes basal ganglia subregions at 4.7 T. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

We provide histological descriptions of the major sensory nuclei of the dorsal thalamus and the superior colliculus (SC) of mouse lemurs (Microcebus murinus). The dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus has the six layers typical of strepsirrhine primates, with matching pairs of magnocellular, parvocellular, and koniocellular layers, one of each pair for each eye. Unlike most primates, magnocellular and parvocellular layers exhibit only small differences in cell size. All layers express vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGLUT2), reflecting terminations of retinal inputs, and the expression of VGLUT2 is much less dense in the koniocellular layers. Parvalbumin is densely expressed in all layers, while SMI-32 is densely expressed only in the magnocellular layers. The adjoining pulvinar complex has a posterior nucleus with strong VGLUT2 expression, reflecting terminations from the SC. The SC is laminated with dense expression of VGLUT2 in the upper superficial gray layer, reflecting terminations from the retina. The ventral (MGNv), medial, and dorsal divisions of the medial geniculate complex are only moderately differentiated, although patches of dense VGLUT2 expression are found along the outer border of MGNv. The ventroposterior nucleus has darkly stained cells in Nissl stained sections, and narrow septa separating patchy regions of dense VGLUT2 expression that likely represent different body parts. Overall, these structures resemble those in other strepsirrhine primates, although they are smaller, with the sensory nuclei appearing to occupy proportionately more of the dorsal thalamus than in larger primates.",lateral geniculate nucleus; medial geniculate nucleus; primates; prosimian; pulvinar; >; strepsirrhine; ventroposterior nucleus; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEINS; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; ARCHITECTONIC SUBDIVISIONS; LAMINAR ORGANIZATION; CYTOCHROME-OXIDASE; PROSIMIAN PRIMATE; AUDITORY-CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; GALAGO

A key parameter that the nervous system regulates is the level of force to exert against an object during tasks such as grasping. Previous studies indicate that the basal ganglia do not exhibit increased activity with increasing amplitude of force, although these conclusions are based mainly on the putamen. The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate which regions in the basal ganglia, thalamus, and motor cortex display increased activity when producing pinch-grip contractions of increasing force amplitude. We found that the internal portion of the globus pallidus (GPi) and subthalamic nucleus (STN) had a positive increase in percent signal change with increasing force, whereas the external portion of the globus pallidus, anterior putamen, posterior putamen, and caudate did not. In the thalamus we found that the ventral thalamic regions increase in percent signal change and activation volume with increasing force amplitude. The contralateral and ipsilateral primary motor/somatosensory (M1/S1) cortices had a positive increase in percent signal change and activation volume with increasing force amplitude, and the contralateral M1/S1 had a greater increase in percent signal change and activation volume than the ipsilateral side. We also found that deactivation did not change across force in the motor cortex and basal ganglia, but that the ipsilateral M1/S1 had greater deactivation than the contralateral M1/S1. Our findings provide direct evidence that GPi and STN regulate the amplitude of force output. These findings emphasize the heterogeneous role of individual nuclei of the basal ganglia in regulating specific parameters of motor output.",nan; PRIMATE MOTOR CORTEX; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; THALAMIC INPUTS; FUNCTIONAL MRI; INTERHEMISPHERIC INHIBITION; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; ISOMETRIC FORCE; MACAQUE MONKEYS

Both ligands were radiolabeled with fluorine-18 via nucleophilic displacement of the corresponding 2-chloropyridine precursor with [F-18] potassium fluoride. [F-18]MK-1312 was found to have a suitable signal for quantification of mGluR1 receptors in nonhuman primates and was more thoroughly characterized. In vitro autoradiographic studies with [F-18]MK-1312 in rhesus monkey and human brain tissue slices revealed an uptake distribution consistent with the known distribution of mGluR1, with the highest uptake in the cerebellum, moderate uptake in the hippocampus, thalamus, and cortical regions, and lowest uptake in the caudate and putamen. In vitro saturation binding studies in rhesus monkey and human cerebellum homogenates confirmed that [F-18]MK-1312 binds to a single site with a Bmax/Kd ratio of 132 and 98, respectively. PET studies in rhesus monkey with [F-18]MK-1312 showed high brain uptake and a regional distribution consistent with in vitro autoradiography results. Blockade of [F-18]MK-1312 uptake with mGluR1 allosteric antagonist MK-5435 dose-dependently reduced tracer uptake in all regions of gray matter to a similarly low level of tracer uptake. This revealed a large specific signal useful for determination of mGluR1 receptor occupancy in rhesus monkey.

Evidence for more direct sensorimotor links is now presented to show that cerebral cortex rarely, if ever, receives messages representing receptor activity only; thalamic inputs to cortex also carry copies of current motor instructions. Pathways afferent to the thalamus represent the primary input to neocortex. Generally they are made up of branching axons that send one branch to the thalamus and another to output centers of the brain stem or spinal cord. The information transmitted through the classical sensory pathways to the thalamus represents not only information about the environment and the body, but also about instructions currently on their way to motor centers. The proposed hierarchy of direct corticocortical connections of the sensory pathways is not the only possible hierarchy of cortical connections. There is also a hierarchy of the corticofugal pathways to motor centers in the midbrain, and there are transthalamic corticocortical pathways that may show a comparable hierarchy. The extent to which these hierarchies may match each other, and relate to early developmental changes are poorly defined at present, but are important for understanding mechanisms that can link action and perception in the developing brain.",nan; RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; RETICULARIS TEGMENTI PONTIS; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; STRIATE-RECIPIENT ZONE; DORSAL COLUMN NUCLEI; CORTICOTHALAMIC PROJECTIONS; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; MACAQUE MONKEY; VISUAL-CORTEX; LAMINAR DISTRIBUTION

Injections of biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) in the medial pulvinar, however, reveal retrogradely filled neurons up to 2.0 mm from the injection edge. Serial section reconstruction (n = 18) confirmed that retrogradely filled neurons projected to the injection site and showed that they had additional long-range collaterals within the posterior pulvinar. Arrays of small, beaded terminations occurred in multiple foci along the collaterals. Terminal arrays were up to 1.0 mm in length; foci were separated by about 0.7 mm. Somata were large (average area = 220 mu m(2)), and dendritic arbors were radiate and also large (about 1.0 mm in diameter), but without either the appendages of classical interneurons or the hairlike spines characteristic of radiate pulvinocortical projection neurons. Double labeling for BDA and parvalbumin (PV) or BDA and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) indicated that these large neurons were positive for both PV and GABA. Double labeling for PV and GABA, or PV and glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) revealed a small number of similarly large neurons in the posterior pulvinar that were positive for both substances. Thus, we propose that these neurons are a novel class of inhibitory interneuron, longer range than the classic thalamic local circuit interneurons. Future questions include how these neurons relate to other inhibitory systems and specific postsynaptic populations and whether they are located preferentially within the posterior pulvinar, possibly related to the multimodal character of this thalamic region.",axon collaterals; biotinylated dextran amine; divergence; inhibition; intrathalamic; GABA-IMMUNOREACTIVE NEURONS; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; INFERIOR PULVINAR; THALAMIC NUCLEI; ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE HISTOCHEMISTRY; NEUROCHEMICAL SUBDIVISIONS; ULTRASTRUCTURAL ANALYSIS; ANTEROGRADE TRACER; ORGANIZATION; PROJECTIONS

We correlated changes in PV and Cal staining patterns with the well-documented developmental sequence for primate striate cortex neuron generation and maturation, synaptogenesis, and thalamocortical axon interactions in an attempt to deduce a functional role for these proteins. Our major finding is that Cal and PV have diametrically opposed developmental patterns except in layer 1. At F60 days both are present only in neurons of layer 1 and the number of labeled cell bodies and processes increases up to F125 days. Almost all Cal+ and PV+ cells in layer 1 disappear by P12 weeks. Cal is present by F113 days in pyramidal and stellate neurons, particularly layers 4-6. The number and staining density of cells in layers 2-6 increases up to birth and then both decline by P9-12 weeks. Supragranular layers show a second increase in Cal labeling from P20-36 weeks, and then there is a slow decline to the adult pattern which is reached by P1-2 years. Cell bodies in layers 4A, 4C-alpha, and deep 4C-beta are heavily Cal+ during pre-and early post-natal periods, but upper 4C-beta remains unlabeled. PV is not seen until F155-162 days in layers 2-6. Large stellate and a few pyramidal cells appear first in layers 5/6 and 4C-alpha, but PV+ cell stellate neurons are found in all layers except 4C-beta by P6 weeks. Layer 4C-beta contains a few PV+ cell bodies at P3 weeks, and light neuropile 4C-beta exceeds that of 4C-alpha. Striate cortex has an adult pattern of cell number and neuropile density by P20 weeks. These developmental patterns suggest that the highest density of Cal cell body staining does not correlate with synaptogenesis, or the postnatal critical period of visually driven, binocular interactions. Rather Cal appears when lateral geniculate axons arrive in cortex, persists over the entire span of thalamocortical interactions, and disappears during the decline of cortical plasticity. The appearance of PV is highly correlated with the onset of complex visually driven activity at birth, while both the number of PV+ cell bodies and the density of PV+ neuropile reach adult levels coincident with the completion of thalamocortical connections.",IMMUNOCYTOCHEMISTRY; VISION; MACAQUE; CALCIUM; nan

We characterized the morphology of VPM axons arising in the principal trigeminal sensory nucleus (pV) through injections of biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) placed in pV ofMacaca fascicularisandmulattamonkeys. Labeled terminals formed a patchy bilateral distribution. Within contralateral VPM, patches were found primarily, but not exclusively, within the laterally located, vertical segment, and in ipsilateral VPM, primarily, but not exclusively, in the medially located, horizontal segment. Two fiber types were labeled: thin and thick. Thin fibers were poorly branched and diffusely distributed. They were studded with smallen passantboutons. Most labeled fibers were thick and they branched extensively to form distinctive terminal arbors decorated with numerous boutons that varied in size and shape. Quantitative analysis of thick fiber arbor features showed little difference between the sides, although contralateral boutons were significantly larger than ipsilateral ones. Bouton distribution with respect to counterstained somata suggests that proximal dendrites are their main target. Indeed, ultrastructural examination demonstrated that they provide large diameter dendrites with numerous contacts. Direct comparison of thick fiber terminal arbors to cytochrome oxidase (CO) staining revealed that these arbors are much smaller than individual CO-rich patches believed to designate rods containing discrete body area representations. Thus, each terminal arbor appears to heavily innervate a small number of VPM neurons within a rod.

Design: EEG, EMG, and EOG were recorded continuously via implanted telemetry from 5 unrestrained male rhesus monkeys housed individually under a 16:8 light-dark cycle (LD 16:8; L = 13 lux; D = 0 lux). Results: In a LID 16:8 cycle, all 5 monkeys demonstrated a long period of consolidated sleep during the 8-h dark period. On average, sleep accounted for 89.2% of the 8-h dark period and 25.2% of the 16-hour light period. REM sleep occupied 23% of total sleep time over 24 h, or 10.7% of the total time. The average length of the consolidated sleep (CS) period was 10.5 h, although the time of CS onset was variable. In contrast, the end of CS, and thus the onset of consolidated wakefulness (CW) demonstrated very little variation, typically occurring within 2 min of light onset. Ultradian NREM-REM cycles with periods of approximately 60 min were also observed. EEG delta activity during NREM sleep, thought to reflect the homeostatic sleep process, peaked at 3-4 h after CS onset. Conclusions: The present study demonstrates the feasibility of longterm, unrestrained sleep monitoring in nonhuman primates using fully-implantable biotelemetry. With minor exceptions, most notably a delay in peak delta activity, sleep-wake architecture, regulation, and consolidation in rhesus monkeys strongly resembles that of humans. These results demonstrate that the unrestrained rhesus monkey is an excellent biomedical model for human sleep.",NREM; nonhuman primate; telemetry; EEG; slow wave activity; REM; EEG POWER-DENSITY; INTERINDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES; THALAMOCORTICAL NEURONS; INTERNIGHT RELIABILITY; INDIVIDUAL-DIFFERENCES; AMPLITUDE ANALYSIS; NONHUMAN-PRIMATES; SQUIRREL-MONKEYS; NOCTURNAL SLEEP; YOUNG-ADULTS

As a result of this reorganization, intact inputs from the face expand into the deafferented hand representations. Dorsal column injuries also result in permanent deficits in the use of digits for precision grip and a loss of fractionated movements of the digits. We determined whether the chronic loss of sensory inputs and the behavioral deficits caused by lesions of the dorsal columns in adult macaque monkeys affect organization of the motor cortex. The results show that, in the primary motor cortex, intracortical microstimulation evokes extension-flexion movements of the thumb at significantly fewer sites compared with the normal monkeys. There is a corresponding increase in the adduction-abduction movements. Furthermore, there is a significant increase in the thresholds of the currents required to evoke movements of the digits. Thus, long-term sensory loss in adult monkeys does not change the overall topography of the movement representation in the motor cortex but results in changes in the details of movement representations.",nan; DORSAL COLUMN LESIONS; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; SOMATOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; CORTICAL CONNECTIONS; FASCICULUS-CUNEATUS; FINGER MOVEMENTS; FUNCTIONAL-ROLE; VOLUNTARY MOVEMENTS; MACACA-FASCICULARIS; SQUIRREL-MONKEYS

Recent electrophysiological reports suggest that while initial propofol infusion provokes an increase in fast rhythms (from beta to gamma range), slow activity (from delta to alpha range) rises selectively during loss of consciousness. Dynamic causal modeling was used to investigate the neural mechanisms mediating these changes in spectral power in humans. We analyzed source-reconstructed data from frontal and parietal cortices during normal wakefulness, propofol-induced mild sedation, and loss of consciousness. Bayesian model selection revealed that the best model for explaining spectral changes across the three states involved changes in corticothalamic interactions. Compared with wakefulness, mild sedation was accounted for by an increase in thalamic excitability, which did not further increase during loss of consciousness. In contrast, loss of consciousness per se was accompanied by a decrease in backward corticocortical connectivity from frontal to parietal cortices, while thalamocortical connectivity remained unchanged. These results emphasize the importance of recurrent corticocortical communication in the maintenance of consciousness and suggest a direct effect of propofol on cortical dynamics.",nan; PRIMARY AUDITORY-CORTEX; DYNAMIC CAUSAL-MODELS; NEURAL MASS MODEL; GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; VEGETATIVE STATE; INFORMATION-TRANSFER; NEURONAL PATHWAYS; DEFAULT NETWORK; RHESUS-MONKEY; VISUAL-CORTEX

Here we describe responses of macaque PIVC neurons to three-dimensional (3D) vestibular and optic flow stimulation. We found robust vestibular responses to both translational and rotational stimuli in the retroinsular (Ri) and adjacent secondary somatosensory (S2) cortices. PIVC neurons did not respond to optic flow stimulation, and vestibular responses were similar in darkness and during visual fixation. Cells in the upper bank and tip of the lateral sulcus (Ri and S2) responded to sinusoidal vestibular stimuli with modulation at the first harmonic frequency and were directionally tuned. Cells in the lower bank of the lateral sulcus (mostly Ri) often modulated at the second harmonic frequency and showed either bimodal spatial tuning or no tuning at all. All directions of 3D motion were represented in PIVC, with direction preferences distributed approximately uniformly for translation, but showing a preference for roll rotation. Spatiotemporal profiles of responses to translation revealed that half of PIVC cells followed the linear velocity profile of the stimulus, one-quarter carried signals related to linear acceleration (in the form of two peaks of direction selectivity separated in time), and a few neurons followed the derivative of linear acceleration (jerk). In contrast, mainly velocity-coding cells were found in response to rotation. Thus, PIVC comprises a large functional region in macaque areas Ri and S2, with robust responses to 3D rotation and translation, but is unlikely to play a significant role in visual/vestibular integration for self-motion perception.",nan; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL AREA; OPTOKINETIC AFTER-NYSTAGMUS; MONKEYS MACACA-FASCICULARIS; ALERT MONKEY; LINEAR ACCELERATION; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; CORTICOCORTICAL CONNECTIONS; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; SAIMIRI-SCIUREUS; THALAMUS NEURONS

In the same animals, neuroanatomical tracers were placed into electrophysiologically identified sites in PV and/or the second somatosensory area (S2). Foci of anterograde and retrograde label were related to electrophysiological maps of cortical areas and cortical and thalamic architecture. The results lead to the following conclusions: (1) Multiunit recordings from cortex on the upper bank of the lateral sulcus demonstrate that PV is somatotopically organized, with the face representation adjoining area 3b and the hindlimb and tail representations away from this border in cortex deep on the upper bank of the lateral sulcus. The forelimb representation is caudal in PV adjacent to the S2 forelimb representation. The body surface representation in PV approximates a mirror image of that in S2; (2) Areas PV and S2 are less myelinated and have less cytochrome oxidase enzyme activity than area 3b; (3) The ventroposterior inferior nucleus (VPI) of the thalamus provides the major somatosensory projections to PV. PV is reciprocally connected with VPI and anterior pulvinar; (4) PV has ipsilateral cortical connections with areas 3a, 3b, 1, and M1 and higher order somatosensory fields, and at least most of these connections are somatotopically matched; and (5) Callosal connections of PV are with S2 and PV of the other cerebral hemisphere.

For example, many nuclei in the human thalamus, with projections to the cerebral cortex, contain a large number of neurons with intense BuChE activity. Thalamocortical projections subserve a variety of cognitive functions. Due to genetic mutations, there are individuals who do not have detectable BuChE activity (silent BuChE). While the prevalence of silent BuChE is only 1:100,000 in European and American populations, it is 1:24 in the Vysya community in Coimbatore, India. To examine whether there are differences in cognitive functions between individuals with silent BuChE and those expressing normal BuChE (wild-type), twelve healthy individuals with silent BuChE and thirteen healthy individuals with wildtype BuChE, all from the Vysya community in Coimbatore, were tested for cognitive function using the Automated Neuropsychological Assessment Metrics test battery. The silent BuChE group was slightly faster on simple reaction tasks, but slower on a visual perceptual matching task. Furthermore, discriminant function analyses correctly classified 11/12 silent and 8/13 wild-type BuChE subjects (76% correct classification overall) based on BuChE status. Different profiles of cognitive test performance between individuals with silent and wild-type BuChE were observed.

In addition, visual motion information reaches hMT+ directly from the thalamus, bypassing the V1, through a direct pathway. We aimed at elucidating whether this direct route between LGN and hMT+ represents a 'fast lane' reserved to highspeed motion, as proposed previously, or it is merely involved in processing motion information irrespective of speeds. We evaluated functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses elicited by moving visual stimuli and applied connectivity analyses to investigate the effect of motion speed on the causal influence between LGN and hMT+, independent of V1, using the Conditional Granger Causality (CGC) in the presence of slow and fast visual stimuli. Our results showed that at least part of the visual motion information from LGN reaches hMT+, bypassing V1, in response to both slow and fast motion speeds of the perceived stimuli. We also investigated whether motion speeds have different effects on the connections between LGN and functional subdivisions within hMT+: direct connections between LGN and MT-proper carry mainly slow motion information, while connections between LGN and MST carry mainly fast motion information. The existence of a parallel pathway that connects the LGN directly to hMT+ in response to both slow and fast speeds may explain why MT and MST can still respond in the presence of V1 lesions.

In the developing animal brain, including those of non-human primates (NHPs), anaesthetics induce apoptotic cell death. We previously reported that a 5h isoflurane (ISO) exposure in infant NHPs increases apoptosis 13-fold compared with control animals. However, the majority of paediatric surgeries requiring anaesthesia are of shorter durations. We examined whether 3 h ISO exposure similarly increases neuroapoptosis in the NHP developing brain. Methods: Six-day-old NHP infants (Macaca mulatta) were exposed to 3h of a surgical plane of ISO (n = 6) or to room air (n = 5). Following exposure, NHP brains were screened for neuronal and oligodendrocyte apoptosis using activated caspase-3 immunolabelling and unbiased stereology. Results: ISO treatment increased apoptosis (neurones + oligodendrocyte) to greater than four times that in the control group [mean density of apoptotic profiles: 57 (SD 22) mm(-3) vs 14 (SD 5.2) mm(-3), respectively]. Oligodendrocyte apoptosis was evenly distributed throughout the white matter whereas neuroapoptosis occurred primarily in the cortex (all regions), caudate, putamen and thalamus. Conclusions: A 3 h exposure to ISO is sufficient to induce widespread neurotoxicity in the developing primate brain. These results are relevant for clinical medicine, as many surgical and diagnostic procedures in children require anaesthesia durations similar to those modelled here.

Migration of layer IV neurons into the cortical plate just precedes thalamocortical invasion, suggesting that these neurons could cue or tropically direct thalamic ingrowth, To explore the interactions of layer IV neurons and their thalamocortical input, we administered a mitotic inhibitor methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) intraperitoneally to timed pregnant hamsters on E14 when layer IV neurons are normally being generated in striate cortex. Reduced numbers of cortical neurons overall, the absence of small-diameter granule neurons, and the absence of the zone of reduced density of callosally projecting neurons suggest that neither the depletion of layer IV cells in the ventricular zone nor thalamic afferents in the subplate or cortical plate respecify the later generated cohort of neurons (presumptive layer II/III neurons) to acquire morphological and connectional properties of layer IV. Dil injections into the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGd) of animals from embryonic (E15) and postnatal (P7) ages shaw that the final position of thalamic axons with respect to layer V is not affected by the absence of E14 neurons. In the normal visual cortex, geniculocortical axons have begun their arborization in their presumptive target layer in the upper cortex immediately below the undifferentiated cortical plate on P4, while in MAM animals, this process occurs 1 d later. The extent and density of arborization is much reduced in the thinner cortex of the MAM animals. We thus find no evidence for instruction of migrating neurons by thalamocortical areas to assume the layer IV phenotype; if instruction does occur it must take place in a very restricted time window. Thalamic axons can also find their laminar position in the absence of cells of this phonotype.",nan; MAMMALIAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; LARVAL FROG RETINA; GOLDEN-HAMSTER; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; THALAMOCORTICAL AFFERENTS; NEUROTOXIC DESTRUCTION; TERMINAL ARBORS; RHESUS-MONKEY; ADULT-RAT

However, the actual function of these large nuclei of the thalamus remains unknown. In contrast to the nearby lateral geniculate nucleus, the LP-P complex does not receive any substantial direct projections from the retina. Its main visual inputs come from the mesencephalon and the neocortex. Most cells in the LP-P complex behave like cortical units. They are tuned to the orientation, direction, spatial and temporal frequencies of the visual stimulus. In addition, most units are binocular and sensitive to relative retinal disparity. Despite their multiple inputs, the LP-P complex cells form an homogeneous population and their overall properties do not reflect those of a given cortical or subcortical area. On the basis of its afferent and efferent connectivity, it has been proposed that the LP-P complex may serve as a relay of an extrageniculate ascendant pathway which originates from the superior colliculus, and/or provide another route for the geniculo-striate input to reach the extrastriate areas. Despite the fact that there is some electro-physiological evidence of such functions, it is now often suggested that the LP-P complex may integrate its multiple inputs and be involved in functions which go beyond those of a simple thalamic relay.

The molecular weight of TGF-beta 1, PDGF-BB, and GDNF in the homogenate of spinal cord was 25 KDa, 30 KDa, and 34 KDa, respectively. Immunolabeling revealed GDNF was ubiquitously distributed in the cerebral cortex, hippocampal formation, basal nuclei, thalamus, hypothalamus, brainstem, cerebellum, and spinal cord. TGF-beta 1 was least distributed and found only in the medulla oblongata and spinal cord, and PDGF-BB expression was also limited and present only in the brainstem and spinal cord. Besides, TGF-beta 1, PDGF-BB, and GDNF were localized in the astrocytes and microglia of spinal cord and hippocampus, and their expression was mainly found in the cytoplasm and primary dendrites. The mRNA of TGF-beta 1, PDGF-BB, and GDNF was localized to neuronal subpopulations in the spinal cord and cerebellum. These findings suggest that TGF-beta 1, GDNF and PDGF-BB may be associated with neuronal survival, neural regeneration and functional recovery in the CNS of adult rhesus macaques, providing the potential insights into the development or refinement of therapies based on these factors.",Transforming growth factor beta1; Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor; Platelet-derived growth factor-BB; Rhesus macaque; Cellular distribution; GROWTH-FACTOR-BETA; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR GDNF; FACTOR MESSENGER-RNA; TGF-BETA; SPINAL-CORD; PROGENITOR CELLS; TRANSFORMING GROWTH-FACTOR-BETA-1; IMMUNOHISTOCHEMICAL LOCALIZATION; NEURONAL DIFFERENTIATION; ACTIVATED MICROGLIA

Results have revealed that (1) the forelimb is represented predominantly in the PMdr, while only a few sites representing other body parts are distributed as embedded within the forelimb representation; (2) the corticostriatal input zone is located in the striatal cell bridges and their surroundings; (3) the cells of origin of the thalamocortical projections to the PMdr are located mainly in the parvicellular division of the ventroanterior nucleus, the oral divison of the ventrolateral nucleus, area X, the caudal divison of the ventrolateral nucleus, the mediodorsal nucleus, and the intralaminar nuclear group; (4) the PMdr is interconnected primarily with higher-order motor-related areas and dorsal area 46. These data indicate that the input-output pattern of the PMdr resembles those of the presupplementary motor area and the rostral cingulate motor area, and that the PMdr may play critical roles in higher-order motor functions.

Cell bodies were described from Nissl material. Golgi-impregnated dendritic arborizations were reconstructed from serial sections and digitized in three dimensions by computer-assisted microscopy. The central complex was subdivided into three parts on the basis of cytoarchitectonic and hodological criteria: pars parafascicularis (medial), pars media (intermediate), and pars paralateralis (lateral). The mean cross-sectional areas of cell bodies were identical (181 mum2) in the three parts in macaques. In humans they were larger in the pars parafascicularis (304 mum2) than in the other parts (248 and 240 mum2). Small local circuit neurons were found throughout the complex. Large projection neurons differed statistically in the three parts. In macaques, pars parafascicularis neurons had few dendritic stems and tips (3-11) and a short total dendritic length (2,000 mum). Pars paralateralis neurons had more ramified (5-60) and longer (5,800 mum) dendrites. They bore numerous axonlike processes. Pars media neurons had intermediate characteristics (5-9; 2,400 mum). In humans, pars parafascicular neurons had similar topological characteristics (3-12) but longer dendrites (3,000 mum) than in the monkey. Pars paralateralis neurons had more branched (6-71) and longer (9,000 mum) dendrites, with more numerous axonlike processes. Pars media neurons also had intermediate characteristics (4-25; 3,800 mum). The present study supports a tripartite subdivision of the primate central complex and demonstrates significant interspecies differences.

The motor circuits within the striato-pallidal complex are thought to facilitate desired movement and inhibit unwanted movement through their influence via thalamus, mainly on precentral motor cortical regions. Lesions in the motor thalamus, or in the globus pallidus, therefore might be expected to impair voluntary movement. But stereotaxic lesions in patients with Parkinson's disease directed at the motor thalamus verified at autopsy, and lesions in the globus pallidus, which improve rigidity and tremor apparently do not worsen parkinsonian hypokinesia and bradykinesia; nor do they regularly cause dyskinesias. Reasons for this discrepancy are reviewed. It is concluded that the motor circuits of the basal ganglia are part of a distributed motor system which can operate, albeit imperfectly, in the absence of striato-pallido-thalamo-cortical feedback. There may, however be subtle defects in motor performance after thalamic and pallidal lesions which have escaped attention. Further consideration leads to two hypotheses concerning normal basal ganglia motor function. First it seems most likely that it is a pause in firing of medial pallidal and substantia nigra reticulata neurons that by disinhibition of thalamic targets, permits movements generated by cortical motor areas. An increase in firing of medial pallidal neurons, which so far has been the major focus of attention, may be more concerned with inhibition of unwanted movement. Secondly, we suggest that the basal ganglia play a particular role in motor control. A change in firing of medial pallidal neurons appears to occur too late to initiate a new movement. However the motor circuit within the striato-pallidal system routinely receives a continuous delayed read-out of cortical motor activity and issues an output directed via thalamus mainly to premotor cortical regions. This may permit the routine automatic execution of sequences of movements generated in cortical motor areas. There is evidence that other regions of the striatum respond to significant external or internal cues as dictated by their cortical inputs, the significance being determined by memory, novelty, emotional and other contexts. We suggest that such events capture the attention of the non-motor striatum, which then interrupts the routine operation of the motor circuit, perhaps at the level of the medial pallidum and substantia nigra pars reticulata, to permit new cortical motor action.",BASAL GANGLIA FUNCTION; STEREOTAXIC SURGERY; SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA; NIGRA PARS RETICULATA; PRIMATE GLOBUS PALLIDUS; MONKEY CAUDATE NEURONS; SINGLE CELL DISCHARGE; SUBSTANTIA NIGRA; OCULOMOTOR FUNCTIONS; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; BEHAVING MONKEY; MACACA-FASCICULARIS

Retrograde fluorescent tracers were injected in different loci of the parietal cortex. Injected areas were verified cytoarchitectonically and confirmed by analyzing the retrograde thalamic labeling pattern obtained. Anterograde fluorescent tracers were placed in the intermediate and lateral deep cerebellar nuclei. The topographical overlap between cerebellar terminals and parietal-projecting thalamic neurons was analyzed. In the central lateral (CL) and ventrolateral (VL) thalamic nuclei, cells projecting to anterior somatosensory (S1) and posterior parietal (PPC) cortices were demonstrated to receive direct cerebellar input. In particular, two patterns of organization were revealed. In CL, the PPC- and S1-projecting neurons, both receiving cerebellar fibers, were intermingled. In VL, PPC, and S1-projecting neurons were instead segregated, and the areas containing labeled neurons received separate contingents of cerebellar fibers. These patterns suggest that in CL axons originating from the same or neighboring cerebellar neurons can terminate on both PPC- and S1-projecting neurons, while in VL cerebellar information is funneled to S1 and PPC through two segregated parallel pathways. The significance of the observed organization is discussed comparing findings in other species and in relation with electrophysiological and functional studies on cerebelloparietal interrelationships.

Here we show that endogenous neural precursors can be induced in situ to differentiate into mature neurons, in regions of adult mammalian neocortex that do not normally undergo any neurogenesis. This differentiation occurs in a layer- and region-specific manner, and the neurons can re-form appropriate corticothalamic connections. We induced synchronous apoptotic degeneration(7,8) of corticothalamic neurons in layer VI of anterior cortex of adult mice and examined the fates of dividing cells within cortex, using markers for DNA replication (5-bromodeoxyuridine; BrdU) and progressive neuronal differentiation. Newly made, BrdU-positive cells expressed NeuN, a mature neuronal marker, in regions of cortex undergoing targeted neuronal death and survived for at least 28 weeks. Subsets of BrdU+ precursors expressed Doublecortin, a protein found exclusively in migrating neurons(9,10), and Hu, an early neuronal marker(11,12). Retrograde labelling from thalamus demonstrated that BrdU+ neurons can form long-distance corticothalamic connections. Our results indicate that neuronal replacement therapies for neurodegenerative disease and CNS injury may be possible through manipulation of endogenous neural precursors in situ.",nan; MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN; NEURAL STEM-CELLS; SUBVENTRICULAR ZONE; MAMMALIAN FOREBRAIN; EMBRYONIC NEURONS; GENERATED NEURONS; GROWTH-FACTOR; MOUSE BRAIN; RAT; MIGRATION

This amount of reorganization was considered to be an upper limit imposed by the size of the projection zones of individual thalamocortical axons, which typically also extend a mediolateral distance of 1 to 2 millimeters. However, after extensive long-term deafferentations in adult primates, changes in cortical maps were found to be an order of magnitude greater than those previously described.

Lesions of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord at cervical levels in monkeys result in expansion of the intact chin inputs into the deafferented hand representation in area 3b, second somatosensory (S2) and parietal ventral (PV) areas of the somatosensory cortex, ventroposterior lateral nucleus (VPL) of the thalamus, and cuneate nucleus of the brainstem. Here, we describe the extent and nature of reorganization of the cuneate and gracile nuclei of adult macaque monkeys with chronic unilateral lesions of the dorsal columns, and compare it with the reorganization of area 3b in the same monkeys. In both, area 3b and the cuneate nucleus chin inputs expand to reactivate the deafferented neurons. However, unlike area 3b, neurons in the cuneate nucleus also acquire receptive fields on the shoulder, neck, and occiput. A comparison with the previously published results shows that reorganization in the cuneate nucleus is similar to that in VPL. Thus, the emergent topography following deafferentations by spinal cord injuries undergoes transformation as the reorganized inputs ascend from subcortical nuclei to area 3b.

Several brain imaging studies among patients with CPSP demonstrate that the pathophysiological mechanism underlying this condition is the maladaptive plasticity of pain-related brain regions. However, the temporal profile of the regional plastic changes, as suggested by brain imaging of CPSP patients, as well as their cellular basis, is unknown. To investigate these issues, we performed voxel-based morphometry (VBM) using T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and immunohistochemical analysis with our established CPSP monkey model. From 8 weeks after a hemorrhagic lesion to the unilateral ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus, the monkeys exhibited significant behavioral changes that were interpreted as reflecting allodynia. The present VBM results revealed a decrease in gray matter volume in the pain-related areas after several weeks following the lesion. Furthermore, immunohistochemical staining in the ipsilesional posterior insular cortex (ipsi-PIC) and secondary somatosensory cortex (ipsi-SII), where the significant reduction in gray matter volume was observed in the VBM result, displayed a significant reduction in both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic terminals compared to intact monkeys. Our results suggest that progressive changes in neuronal morphology, including synaptic loss in the ipsi-PIC/SII, are involved in the CPSP.",allodynia; chronic pain; insular cortex; macaque; thalamic syndrome; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; RECEPTOR-BINDING; PATHOPHYSIOLOGY; INTERNEURONS; STIMULATION; RESPONSES

Area GrFO displays strong connections with areas DO, PrCO, and ventrolateral prefrontal (VLPF) area 12l, and even more with the mostly hand-related ventral premotor (PMv) area F5a. Other connections involve the mostly face/mouth-related PMv area F5c, the arm-related area F6/pre-SMA, the hand-related fields of VLPF areas 46v and 12r, and area SII, mostly the hand representation. Furthermore, area GrFO shows rich connectivity with several components of the limbic system including orbitofrontal areas 12o, 12m, and 11, the agranular and dysgranular insula, the agranular cingulate area 24, and the amygdala. Thalamic afferents originate primarily from the parvocellular and the magnocellular subdivisions of the mediodorsal nucleus and from midline and intralaminar nuclei. This connectivity pattern clearly distinguishes area GrFO from areas DO and PrCO, characterized by a connectivity mostly involving oral sensorimotor and gustatory areas/subcortical structures. The present data suggest, based on connectivity patterns, an involvement of area GrFO in the cortical circuits for controlling goal-directed hand and face/mouth actions. In this context, area GrFO could represent a gateway for the access of limbic inputs, for example about subjective values, emotional significance of stimuli or internal states, to the PMv areas involved in selecting appropriate goal-directed hand and mouth/face actions.",Hand motor control; Limbic system; Gustatory cortex; Premotor cortex; VENTRAL PREMOTOR CORTEX; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; CORTICAL LARYNX AREA; RHESUS-MONKEY; MACACA-FASCICULARIS; ARCHITECTONIC SUBDIVISION; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; SUBJECTIVE VALUE

To study this role, a clearer understanding of pregeniculate organization is required. Based on its connectivity and neurotransmitter immunocytochemistry, we demonstrate that this nucleus is composed of several subnuclei, suggesting the term, pregeniculate complex (PrGC). The PrGC includes a weakly developed dorsal lamina, rostrally, and a well-developed ventral lamina. The ventral lamina includes the retinorecipient and superior sublayers, rostrally, and the medial division, caudally. A thin lamina of cells lateral to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus is contiguous with the PrGC; we term this the lateral division. The PrGC and the lateral division each project to the SC/NOT; the superior sublayer and medial division of the PrGC are connected reciprocally to the SC/NOT. Immunocytochemistry for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and substance P (SP) further delineate the PrGC subnuclei. The retinorecipient sublayer stains most intensely for GABA and SP. The superior sublayer and medial division also stain strongly for GABA and SP. Essentially all neurons in the lateral division are GABA-positive. The combination of tract tracing and immunocytochemistry demonstrate differences in the connectivity of the PrGC subnuclei and the lateral division with the SC/NOT. This, combined with the differential localization of GABA in the PrGC, provides a basis for further study of its functional role. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

Under standardized conditions and polysomnographic control, the patients underwent repeated 24-hour study sessions covering the entire clinical course of the disease. Hormones were assayed at 30-min intervals. Four healthy volunteers were used as controls. A sleep/wake cycle was always absent in fatal familial insomnia. Serum somatotropin and prolactin concentrations never exceeded the normal range of variation. The nocturnal elevation of somatotropin disappeared simultaneously with sleep loss, whereas a significant 24-hour component of variations in serum prolactin levels was present for months after total disruption of the sleep/wake cycle, with normally placed nocturnal acrophases. Complete obliteration of the 24-hour component was achieved for prolactin only in the advanced stages, through a progressive decrease in 24-hour amplitude of variation. Selective and progressive degeneration of the mediodorsal and anterior ventral nuclei of the thalamus causes an early obliteration of the 24-hour rhythm of somatotropin and a later disappearance of circadian prolactin rhythmicity. The persistence of a significant circadian rhythm for months after total disruption of the sleep/wake cycle indicates that prolactin rhythmicity is not exclusively sleep-entrained.",SOMATOTROPIN; PROLACTIN; INSOMNIA; THALAMIC DISEASES; CIRCADIAN RHYTHMS; CLINICAL NEUROENDOCRINOLOGY; GROWTH-HORMONE SECRETION; SLEEP-WAKING CYCLE; PRION PROTEIN GENE; PLASMA PROLACTIN; THALAMIC NUCLEI; RHESUS-MONKEY; CORTISOL; RELEASE; WAKEFULNESS; LESIONS

This study is focused on the second of these. In monkeys, deafferented for two years by section of the cuneate fasciculus at the C1 level, there was extensive withdrawal of axon terminals from thalamus and cortex, detectable a decade before visible atrophy of their parent neuronal somata in the cuneate nucleus or thalamus.

Donepezil, an acetylcholine esterase inhibitor (AChEI), has been recommended as a treatment option for patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). We aimed to characterize the effects of donepezil on rCMRglu using FDG-PET in non-human primates. We investigated the effects of administration of donepezil (500 mu g/kg, i.m.), the non-selective muscarinic ACh receptor antagonist scopolamine (30 mu g/kg, i.m.), and the coadministration of both drugs on the rCMRglu of conscious young rhesus monkeys. Donepezil increased the rCMRglu in all regions of interest except in the thalamus. Scopolamine treatment also increased the rCMRglu in all regions of interest except the cerebellum and thalamus. However, these effects disappeared with coadministration of the drugs. This PET study showed that administration of donepezil or scopolamine alone increased the rCMRglu in conscious rhesus monkeys. We also found that the donepezil-induced increase was abolished by simultaneous administration of scopolamine, suggesting that muscarinic ACh receptor function plays an important role in the effect of donepezil.",FDG-PET; Donepezil; Scopolamine; Muscarinic ACh receptor; Rhesus monkey; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; GLUCOSE METABOLIC-RATE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; IN-VIVO; ACETYLCHOLINE-RELEASE; TREATED PATIENTS; AGED RATS; MEMORY; GALANTAMINE; HUMANS

Hitherto, experimental studies have suggested that STN-HFS reduces the activity of STN neurons. However, some recent reports have challenged this view, showing that STN-HFS might also increase the activity of globus pallidus internalis (GPi) neurons that are under strong excitatory drive of the STN. In addition, most results emanate from studies applying acute STN-HFS, while parkinsonian patients receive chronic stimulation. Thus, the present study was designed to assess the effect of chronic (10 days) STN-HFS in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-treated nonhuman primate. For this purpose, 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG) uptake, a measure of global synaptic activity, was assessed in the basal ganglia and the motor thalamus after chronic unilateral STN-HFS. Cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI) mRNA expression, a marker of efferent metabolic activity, was additionally assessed in the globus pallidus. Chronic STN-HFS (i) reversed abnormally decreased 2-DG uptake in the STN of parkinsonian nonhuman primates, (ii) reversed abnormally increased 2-DG accumulation in the GPi while COI mRNA expression was increased, suggesting global activation of GPi neurons, and (iii) reversed abnormally increased 2-DG uptake in the ventrolateral motor thalamus nucleus. The simultaneous decrease in 2-DG uptake and increase in COI mRNA expression are difficult to reconcile with the current model of basal ganglia function and suggest that the mechanisms by which STN-HFS exerts its clinical benefits are more complex than a simple reversal of abnormal activity in the STN and its targets.",basal ganglia; deep brain stimulation; globus pallidus internalis; motor thalamus; STN; subthalamic nucleus; DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; NIGRA PARS RETICULATA; CEREBRAL GLUCOSE-UTILIZATION; LEVODOPA-INDUCED DYSKINESIA; MPTP-INDUCED PARKINSONISM; INDUCED CELLULAR DEFECTS; PRIMATE MOTOR THALAMUS; SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; NUCLEUS STIMULATION; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION

Such changes were further examined by studying immunoreactivity for calbindin, calretinin, and parvalbumin, three calcium-binding proteins that mark distinct subpopulations of GABA neurons, in macaques that had been monocularly deprived by intravitreal injection of tetrodotoxin. Deprivation for 5 d dr longer produced a reversal in the normal pattern of calbindin immunostaining in layer III, from one In which intense neuronal immunostaining surrounded the cytochrome oxidase-rich puffs to one in which it occupied the puffs; Over the same period, calbindin immunostaining in other layers was reduced across the entire width of deprived-eye columns or extended into flanking regions of normal-eye columns. In contrast, reduction in parvalbumin immunostaining occurred only in deprived-eye columns and included only terminals with short periods of deprivation (up to 17 d) bet both terminals and somata with longer periods. No change in calretinin immunoreactivity was observed. These findings demonstrate that GABA neurons of macaque V1 vary in their response to monocular deprivation according to their neurochemistry and position, suggesting that the weight of inputs from the two eyes and the intrinsic characteristics of each GABA population determine how a neuron responds to a change in visual input.",nan; OCULAR-DOMINANCE COLUMNS; MONKEY STRIATE CORTEX; LONG-TERM DEPRESSION; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; THALAMIC VPM NUCLEUS; CYTOCHROME-OXIDASE; PARVALBUMIN IMMUNOREACTIVITY; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; CALBINDIN IMMUNOREACTIVITY; ORIENTATION SELECTIVITY

In the old world monkey, such a CD circuit for saccades has been identified extending from superior colliculus through MD thalamus to frontal cortex, but there is little evidence that this circuit actually contributes to visual perception. We tested the influence of this CD circuit on visual perception by first training macaque monkeys to report their perceived eye direction, and then reversibly inactivating the CD as it passes through the thalamus. We found that the monkey's perception changed; during CD inactivation, there was a difference between where the monkey perceived its eyes to be directed and where they were actually directed. Perception and saccade were decoupled. We established that the perceived eye direction at the end of the saccade was not derived from proprioceptive input from eye muscles, and was not altered by contextual visual information. We conclude that the CD provides internal information contributing to the brain's creation of perceived visual stability. More specifically, the CD might provide the internal saccade vector used to unite separate retinal images into a stable visual scene.",corollary discharge; efference copy; FEF; macaque; MD; visual perception; FRONTAL EYE FIELD; BRAIN-STEM TELLS; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; POSITION INFORMATION; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; RHESUS-MONKEY; SIGNALS SENT; TIME-COURSE; MOVEMENTS

[1993] J. Comp. Neurol. 335:73-91). Inferior temporal areas TEO and TE were injected with wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and tritiated amino acids, respectively, or vice versa, in 1-week-old (N = 6) and 3-4-year-old (N = 6) Macaca mulatta, and the distributions of labeled cells and terminals were examined in subcortical structures. Although the connections of inferior temporal cortex with subcortical structures were found to be similar in infant and adult monkeys, several projections appear to undergo refinement during development. Quantitative analysis showed that 1) whereas the projection from TE to the superior colliculus is consistent (5 of 5 cases) and widespread in infants, it is less reliable (2 of 7 cases) and limited in areal extent in adults; 2) although the projections from TE to nucleus medialis dorsalis and the tail of the caudate are present in infants and adults, they are reduced in adults; and 3) TEO receives input from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus in both infants and adults, but the number of cells giving rise to this projection is lower in adults. There was also a suggestion that TE projects to nucleus paracentralis in infants (2 of 5 cases) but not in adults (0 of 7 cases). No differences between infants and adults were apparent in other subcortical connections, including those with the pulvinar, reticular nucleus, claustrum, and putamen.

The neurochemical substrates of modafinil are unresolved. We postulated that modafinil enhances wakefulness by modulating dopamine (DAT), norepinephrine (NET), or serotonin (SERT) transporter activities. In vivo, we determined DAT and NET occupancy by modafinil by positron emission tomography imaging; in vitro, we determined modafinil activity at the DAT, NET, SERT, and rhesus monkey trace amine receptor 1 (TA1). In rhesus monkey, modafinil occupancy of striatal DAT was detected by [C-11]2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-4-(fluorophenyl) tropane and of thalamic NET by [C-11](S,S)-2-(alpha-(2-methoxyphenoxy)benzyl) morpholine. In vitro, modafinil effects in DAT-human embryonic kidney (HEK), NET-HEK, and SERT-HEK cells were investigated alone or combined with the TA1 receptor. Modafinil (i.v.) occupied striatal DAT sites (5 mg/kg: 35 +/- 12%, n = 4; 8 mg/kg: 54 +/- 3%, n = 3). In thalamus, modafinil occupied NET sites (5 mg/kg: 16 +/- 7.8%, n = 6; 8 mg/ kg: 44 +/- 12%; n = 2). In vitro, modafinil inhibited [H-3] dopamine (IC50 = 6.4 mu M), [H-3] norepinephrine (IC50 = 35.6 mu M), and [H-3] serotonin (IC50 > 500 mu M) transport via the human DAT, NET, and SERT. Modafinil did not activate the TA1 receptor in TA1-HEK cells, but it augmented a monoamine transporter-dependent enhancement of phenethylamine activation of TA1 in TA1-DAT and TA1-NET cells, but not in TA1-SERT cells. The present data provide compelling evidence that modafinil occupies the DAT and NET in living brain of rhesus monkeys and raise the possibility that modafinil affects wakefulness by interacting with catecholamine transporters in brain.",nan; ANTINARCOLEPTIC DRUG; GLUTAMATE RELEASE; COCAINE; PET; AMPHETAMINE; WAKEFULNESS; MONKEYS; BINDING; RAT; BRAIN

Rapid adaptation in behavior has been attributed to frontal cortical circuits, but it is not clear if sensory cortexes also play an essential role in such tasks. In this study we tested whether the auditory cortex was necessary for rapid adaptation in the interpretation of sounds. We used a two-alternative choice sound-categorization task for rats in which the boundary that separated two acoustic categories changed several times within a behavioral session. These shifts in the boundary resulted in changes in the rewarded action for a subset of stimuli. We found that extensive lesions of the auditory cortex did not impair the ability of rats to switch between categorization contingencies and sound discrimination performance was minimally impaired. Similar results were obtained after reversible inactivation of the auditory cortex with muscimol. In contrast, lesions of the auditory thalamus largely impaired discrimination performance and, as a result, the ability to modify behavior across contingencies. Thalamic lesions did not impair performance of a visual discrimination task, indicating that the effects were specific to audition and not to motor preparation or execution. These results suggest that subcortical outputs of the auditory thalamus can mediate rapid adaptation in the interpretation of sounds.",auditory cortex; auditory thalamus; rat; flexibility; lesion; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; BILATERAL ABLATION; MODULATED TONES; DISCRIMINATION; AMYGDALA; LOCALIZATION; PLASTICITY; LESIONS; DEACTIVATION; MACAQUES

Although many of the connections linked neighboring areas, others selectively connected relatively distant areas. Most, but not all, of the connections were reciprocal. Altogether, the connections formed at least two distinct networks within the OMPFC. The ''orbital'' prefrontal network linked most of the areas within the orbital cortex, with very few connections to medial prefrontal areas. Areas Iam, Iapm, Ial, 121, 12m, and 12r in the caudal and lateral parts of the orbital cortex (which received inputs from several sensory modalities) had convergent connections with areas 131, 13m, and 13b in the central orbital cortex, with further connections to the rostral orbital area 11l. For the connections between areas Iapm, Iam, Ial, 13m, 131, and 11l, rostrally directed fibers arose mainly in layer V, whereas caudally directed fibers originated mainly in layer III. The ''medial'' prefrontal network selectively involved medial areas 14r, 14c, 24, 25, 32, and 10m, rostral orbital areas 10o and 11m, and agranular insular area Iai in the posterior orbital cortex. Two orbital areas, 13a and 12o, had substantial connections to both networks and may serve as points of interaction between them; otherwise there were relatively few interconnections. The two networks also had distinct connections with other cortical regions, with limbic structures, and with the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus. Their role in guidance of affective behavior is discussed.

Areas V1, V2, and VS/MT are conserved across mammals and are central for visual behavior. To facilitate the generation of biologically accurate computational models of primate early visual processing, here we provide an overview of over 350 published studies of these three areas in the genus Macaca, whose visual system provides the closest model for human vision. The literature reports 14 anatomical connection types from the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus to V1 having distinct layers of origin or termination, and 194 connection types between V1, V2, and VS, forming multiple parallel and interacting visual processing streams. Moreover, within V1, there are reports of 286 and 120 types of intrinsic excitatory and inhibitory connections, respectively. Physiologically, tuning of neuronal responses to 11 types of visual stimulus parameters has been consistently reported. Overall, the optimal spatial frequency (SF) of constituent neurons decreases with cortical hierarchy. Moreover, VS neurons are distinct from neurons in other areas for their higher direction selectivity, higher contrast sensitivity, higher temporal frequency tuning, and wider SF bandwidth.

Previous studies have demonstrated marked differences in the relative sizes of ON and OFF responses of neurons in the whisker/barrel system. In particular, OFF responses are unexpectedly large in thalamic neurons. Extracellular unit recordings were used to examine whether varying the time between stimulus onset and offset differently affects OFF responses of neurons in the trigeminal ganglion, ventrobasal thalamus, and somatosensory cortical layer IV. Controlled whisker stimuli were used to deflect individual vibrissal hairs in different directions. We hypothesized that, in part because of the gradual waning of central inhibition evoked by stimulus onset, OFF responses of thalamic and cortical neurons but not trigeminal ganglion cells would increase in size with longer duration stimuli, with relative changes being greatest in the cortex. 2. OFF response magnitudes for thalamic and cortical neuronal populations increased as the stimulus duration was increased from 200 to 1,400 ms. Increases were greater at nonoptimal deflection angles. Similarly, individual cells having smaller OFF responses for the short-duration stimulus tended to display proportionately greater increases when the stimulus was lengthened. OFF responses of trigeminal ganglion cells were largely unaffected by stimulus duration. 3. Barrel neurons were subclassified as regular-spike units (RSUs) or fast-spike units (FSUs) on the basis of the time course of their action potentials. ON and OFF responses were smaller in the former and, when the stimulus was lengthened, percentage increases in their OFF responses were greater than those in FSUs. Results illustrate nonlinear transformations of the thalamic input signal by RSUs, which are presumed to be excitatory barrel neurons, and extend previous findings of response similarities between thalamocortical units (TCUs) and FSUs, the latter of which are thought to be inhibitory.ate hyperpolarization. In behaving animals, thalamic inhibition and the LTS mechanism could counterbalance each other to maintain TCUs within an optimal range of responsiveness.",nan; INTRINSIC FIRING PATTERNS; MONKEYS MACACA-MULATTA; BARREL CORTEX; POSTSYNAPTIC POTENTIALS; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; VENTROBASAL THALAMUS; NEOCORTICAL NEURONS; VIBRISSA UNITS; ACTIVE TOUCH; SMI CORTEX

To test the mode of functional connectivity in the basal gan glia circuitry, we studied the activity of simultaneously recorded neurons in the globus pallidus (GP) of a behaving rhesus monkey. The cross-correlograms of pairs of neurons in the GP were compared with those of neurons in the thalamus and frontal cortex and to the cross-correlograms of pallidal pairs after 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) treatment. 2. In contrast with cortical and thalamic neuronal activity, almost all pairs (n = 76/81 pairs; 93.8%, 1,629/1,651 histograms; 98.7%) of GP neurons in the normal monkey were not driven by a common input. 3. The monkey was systemically treated with MPTP until the appearance of parkinsonian signs and an intermittent 7- to 11-Hz action/postural tremor. After the MPTP treatment, many pallidal neurons (49/140; 35%) became oscillatory, and 19% (n = 31/162) of pallidal pairs had oscillatory cross-correlograms. 4. These results support the model of parallel processing in the basal ganglia of normal monkeys and suggest a breakdown of the independent activity in the parkinsonian state.",nan; BASAL GANGLIA; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; SINGLE-UNITS; PRIMATE; CORTEX; ORGANIZATION; ARCHITECTURE; STIMULATION; AFFERENTS

After intracortical microstimulation mapping of the forelimb area in the primary motor cortex of four macaque monkeys, a retrograde tracing study with fluorescent dyes was attempted to label simultaneously neurons in cortical and subcortical sites projecting to the distal forelimb representation area and those projecting to the proximal representation area of the primary motor cortex. Neurons projecting to distal and proximal forelimb parts of the primary motor cortex were largely separate in the following areas: the premotor area, primary somatosensory area, secondary somatosensory area, area 5, and thalamus. In contrast, there was no precise topographic organization of labeled projection neurons in the following areas: the supplementary motor area, cingulate motor area, primary motor cortex adjacent to the injection sites, claustrum, and basal nucleus of Meynert. The present study revealed that the forelimb area of the primary motor cortex receives both segregated and intermixed inputs from cortical and subcortical sources. In particular, the fact that the forelimb area of the primary motor cortex receives topographically organized inputs from the premotor area and nontopographically organized inputs from the supplementary motor area and cingulate motor area indicates possible different functional roles of frontal premotor areas in control of coordinated distal and proximal forelimb movements.",CEREBRAL CORTEX; FORELIMB MOVEMENTS; MOTOR CONTROL; INTRACORTICAL MICROSTIMULATION; FLUORESCENT DYES; MACAQUE MONKEY; RHESUS-MONKEY; PREMOTOR CORTEX; INTRACORTICAL MICROSTIMULATION; INTRINSIC CONNECTIONS; EFFERENT CONNECTIONS; MACACA-FASCICULARIS; CINGULATE CORTEX; MOVEMENTS; NEURONS

This morphological study of riMLF neurons in the rhesus monkey was undertaken to further our understanding of the functional circuitry of the oculomotor system. Our study employed Nissl, Golgi, and computer-assisted methods. The cytoarchitectonic boundaries of the riMLF and its relationships to neighboring structures were determined in both Nissl and Golgi preparations. Five (I-V) distinct morphological types of riMLF neurons were distinguished in the Golgi impregnations on the basis of soma size, dendritic size, numbers of primary dendrites, number of dendritic branch points, as well as form, number, and distribution of dendritic appendages. Type I neurons impregnated most frequently and had the most extensive and highly branched dendritic tree. Type II neurons displayed thick dendrites with complex dendritic appendages, but the dendritic tree was much more compact than that of type I cells. Type III and type V cells had fusiform somas and relatively unbranched dendritic trees but differed greatly in size as well as dendritic morphology. The type IV cell was the smallest neuron and had many characteristics of the local interneurons found in other thalamic, subthalamic, hypothalamic, and midbrain centers. The type V was the largest neuron, least frequently impregnated, and found only at rostral riMLF levels. Digitized reconstructions of each type of neuron were rotated by the computer, which revealed that the dendritic trees of types I, III, and V occupy a disk-like compartment in the riMLF neuropil. In contrast, the trees of types II and IV occupy a roughly spherical compartment. We suggest that three of the cell types are well suited for specific purposes: type II cells for receiving topographically organized inputs that contain spatial information, type I cells for short-lead burst neuron output to the motor neurons or other premotor centers, and type TV cells for inhibitory inputs to type I cells.

We report here the development of 3-(2-(S)-azetidinylmethoxy)-5-(3'-fluoropropyl)pyridine (nifzetidine) as a new putative high-affinity antagonist for nicotinic alpha 4 beta 2 receptors. Nifzetidine in rat brain homogenate assays containing alpha 4 beta 2 sites labeled with H-3-cytisine exhibited a binding affinity: Ki=0.67 nM. The fluorine-18 analog, 3-(2-(5)-azetidinylmethoxy)-5-(3'-F-18-fluoropropyl)pyridine (F-18-nifzetidine), was synthesized in 20%-40% yield, and apparent specific activity was estimated to be above 2 Ci/mu mol. Rat brain slices indicated selective binding of F-18-nifzetidine to thalamus, subiculum, striata, cortex and other regions consistent with alpha 4 beta 2 receptor distribution. This selective binding was displaced >85% by 150 mu M nicotine. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies of F-18-nifzetidine in anesthetized rhesus monkey showed slow uptake in the various brain regions. Retention of (1)8(F)-nifzetidine was maximal in the thalamus and lateral geniculate followed by regions of the temporal and frontal cortex. Cerebellum showed the least uptake. Thalamus to cerebellum ratio was about 2.3 at 180 min postinjection and continued to rise. F-18-Nifzetidine shows promise as a new PET imaging agent for alpha 4 beta 2 nAChR. However, the slow kinetics suggests a need for >3-h PET scans for quantitative studies of the alpha 4 beta 2 nAChRs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

An NPY Y1 PET tracer is useful for determining the level of target engagement by NPY Y1 antagonists in preclinical and clinical studies. Here we report the synthesis and evaluation of [F-18]Y1-973, a novel PET tracer for NPY Vi. [F-18]Y1-973 was radiolabeled by reaction of a primary chloride with [F-18]KF/K2.2.2 followed by deprotection with HCl. [F-18]Y1-973 was produced with high radiochemical purity (>98%) and high specific activity (>1000 Ci/mmol). PET studies in rhesus monkey brain showed that the distribution of [F-18]Y1-973 was consistent with the known NPY Y1 distribution; uptake was highest in the striatum and cortical regions and lowest in the pons, cerebellum nuclei, and brain stem. Blockade of [F-18]Y1-973 uptake with NPY Y1 antagonist Y1-718 revealed a specific signal that was dose-dependently reduced in all regions of grey matter to a similarly low level of tracer uptake, indicative of an NPY Y1 specific signal. In vitro autoradiographic studies with [F-18]Y1-973 in rhesus monkey and human brain tissue slices revealed an uptake distribution consistent with the in vivo PET studies. Highest binding density was observed in the dentate gyrus, caudate-putamen, and cortical regions; moderate binding density in the hypothalamus and thalamus; and lowest binding density in the globus pallidus and cerebellum. In vitro saturation binding studies in rhesus monkey and human caudate-putamen homogenates confirmed a similarly high B-max/K-d ratio for [F-18]Y1-973, suggesting the tracer may provide a specific signal in human brain of similar magnitude to that observed in rhesus monkey. [F-18]Y1-973 is a suitable PET tracer for imaging NPY Y1 in rhesus monkey with potential for translation to human PET studies. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

The object of this study is to confirm by immunoelectron-microscopy the presence of intrinsic and extrinsic connections containing parvalbumin in the monkey visual cortex, by the demonstration of parvalbumin-immunoreactivity in symmetric and asymmetric synapses. We analyzed the distribution of parvalbumin-immunoreactive profiles at the ultrastructural level in the primary visual cortex of old world monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). It has been shown by others that parvalbumin-immunoreactive cells resemble non-spiny stellate cells, double-bouquet cells, chandelier and basket cells2,8,16,21. These neurons are known to be inhibitory and to form symmetric synapses. In fact, we observed that the vast majority of parvalbumin-immunoreactive synaptic contacts in the primary visual cortex of Macaca fascicularis are of the symmetric type (81.7%). Since parvalbumin-positive asymmetric contacts are also present (18.3%) and occur mostly in the thalamic recipient layers, 4C and 4A (9.9%), these afferents probably derive from parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons located in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus.",IMMUNOELECTRON-MICROSCOPY; PARVALBUMIN; MONKEY VISUAL CORTEX; BINDING PROTEIN PARVALBUMIN; VISUAL-CORTEX; GABAERGIC NEURONS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; OLD-WORLD; IMMUNOREACTIVITY; HETEROGENEITY; ORGANIZATION; LOCALIZATION; NEOCORTEX

However, the effectiveness of this technique has been limited by few methods to quantify in three dimensions the relative locations of brain structures, recording chambers and microelectrode trajectories. Here we present such a method. After surgical implantation, recording chambers are fitted with a plastic cylinder that is filled with a high-contrast agent to aid in the segmentation of the cylinder from brain matter in an MRI volume. The resulting images of the filled cylinder correspond to a virtual cylinder that is projected along its long axis - parallel to the trajectories of microelectrodes advanced through the recording chamber - through the three-dimensional image of the brain. This technique, which does not require a stereotaxic coordinate system, can be used to quantify the coverage of an implanted recording chamber relative to anatomical landmarks at any depth or orientation. We have used this technique in conjunction with Caret [Van Essen DC, Drury HA, Dickson J, Harwell J, Hanlon D, Anderson CH. An integrated software suite for surface-based analyses of cerebral cortex.

Ca2+-dependent and Na+-dependent K+ conductances contribute to a slow AHP in thalamic paraventricular nucleus neurons: a novel target for orexin receptors. J Neurophysiol 104: 2052-2062, 2010. First published August 18, 2010; doi:10.1152/jn.00320.2010. Thalamic paraventricular nucleus (PVT) neurons exhibit a postburst apamin-resistant slow afterhyperpolarization (sAHP) that is unique to midline thalamus, displays activity dependence, and is abolished in tetrodotoxin. Analysis of the underlying sI(AHP) confirmed a requirement for Ca2+ influx with contributions from P/Q-, N-, L-, and R subtype channels, a reversal potential near E-K(+) and a significant reduction by UCL-2077, barium or TEA, consistent with a role for K-Ca channels. sI(AHP) was significantly reduced by activation of either the cAMP or the protein kinase C (PKC) signaling pathway. Further analysis of the sAHP revealed an activity-dependent but Ca2+-independent component that was reduced in high [K+](o) and blockable after Na+ substitution with Li+ or in the presence of quinidine, suggesting a role for K-Na channels. The Ca2+-independent sAHP component was selectively reduced by activation of the PKC signaling pathway. The sAHP contributed to spike frequency adaptation, which was sensitive to activation of either cAMP or PKC signaling pathways and, near the peak of membrane hyperpolarization, was sufficient to cause de-inactivation of low threshold T-Type Ca2+ channels, thus promoting burst firing. PVT neurons are densely innervated by orexin-immunoreactive fibers, and depolarized by exogenously applied orexins. We now report that orexin A significantly reduced both Ca2+-dependent and -independent sI(AHP), and spike frequency adaptation. Furthermore orexin A-induced sI(AHP) inhibition was mediated through activation of PKC but not PKA. Collectively, these observations suggest that K-Ca and K-Na channels have a role in a sAHP that contributes to spike frequency adaptation and neuronal excitability in PVT neurons and that the sAHP is a novel target for modulation by the arousal-and feeding-promoting orexin neuropeptides.",nan; ACTIVATED POTASSIUM CHANNEL; HIPPOCAMPAL PYRAMIDAL CELLS; IN-VITRO; RAT-BRAIN; INTERMEDIATE-CONDUCTANCE; CHOLINERGIC ACTIONS; BURSTING NEURONS; MACAQUE MONKEYS; MIDLINE NEURONS; CA2+ CHANNELS

CORTICAL AND SUBCORTICAL AFFERENTS,"In order to compare the frontal cortex of rat and macaque monkey, cortical and subcortical afferents to subdivisions of the medial frontal cortex (MFC) in the rat were analyzed with fluorescent retrograde tracers. In addition to afferent inputs common to the whole MFC, each subdivision of the MFC has a specific pattern of afferent connections. The dorsally situated precentral medial area (PrCm) was the only area to receive inputs from the somatosensory cortex. The specific pattern of afferents common to the ventrally situated prelimbic (PL) and infralimbic (IL) areas included projections from the agranular insular cortex, the entorhinal and piriform cortices, the CA1-CA2 fields of the hippocampus, the subiculum, the endopiriform nucleus, the amygdalopiriform transition, the amygdalohippocampal area, the lateral tegmentum, and the parabrachial nucleus. In all these structures, the number of retrogradely labeled cells was larger when the injection site was located in area IL. The dorsal part of the anterior cingulate area (ACd) seemed to be connectionally intermediate between the adjacent areas PrCm and PL; it receives neither the somatosensory inputs characteristic of area PrCm nor the afferents characteristic of areas PL and IL, with the exception of the afferents from the caudal part of the retrosplenial cortex. A comparison of the pattern of afferent and efferent connections of the rat MFC with the pattern of macaque prefrontal cortex suggests that PrCm and ACd areas share some properties with the macaque premotor cortex, whereas PL and IL areas may have characteristics in common with the cingulate or with medial areas 24, 25, and 32 and with orbital areas 12, 13, and 14 of macaques.

Recovery of hand function is rapid, and, although it is incomplete, within a few months, the monkey uses the initially disabled hand and fingers with considerable skill. We examined the accompanying changes in the pattern of projection of corticospinal neurons to the cervical spinal cord that occurred following such a lesion. Spinal section was done both in newborn and juvenile macaques, and the postlesion period was followed for up to 150 weeks. Corticospinal neuron populations were visualized by using both anterogradely and retrogradely transported labels, and their origins, spinal pathways, and terminations were examined at intervals during the period of recovery of hand function. Immediately following unilateral section of the spinal cord at C3, sampled counts of soma profiles of retrogradely labeled neurons indicated that there was a profound reduction in the corticospinal projection to the hemicord caudal to the lesion. The few labeled corticospinal axons spared by the lesion bypassed the spinal lesion by descending in the contralateral cord and then crossing the midline caudal to the lesion. A few corticospinal axons may also have bypassed the lesion in the ipsilateral ventromedial column when this was not fully interrupted by the lesion. In every monkey, we observed a similar, profound reduction in the corticospinal (and rubrospinal) projections to the hemicord caudal to the lesion: This pattern did not alter significantly over an extended recovery period. An unchanging corticospinal projection to the cervical spinal cord contralateral to the lesion was also visualized in each monkey and resembled that seen in the normal macaque. Although the resolution of the labeling and counting procedures used precluded the identification of small increases in the numbers of corticospinal neurons projecting to the hemicord caudal to the lesion, we concluded that there was no substantial reconstruction of this projection over a recovery period of more than 2 years.

We recorded neural activity in the hippocampus and retrosplenial cortex of two female rhesus macaques as they visually selected targets in year-old and newly acquired object-scene associations. Whereas hippocampal activity was unchanging with memory age, the retrosplenial cortex responded with greater magnitude alpha oscillations (10-15 Hz) and greater phase locking to memory-guided eye movements during retrieval of old events. A similar old-memory enhancement was observed in the anterior cingulate cortex but in a beta2/gamma band (28-35 Hz). In contrast, remote retrieval was associated with decreased gamma-band synchrony between the hippocampus and each neocortical area. The increasing retrosplenial alpha oscillation and decreasing hippocampocortical synchrony with memory age may signify a shift in frank memory allocation or, alternatively, changes in selection among distributed memory representations in the primate brain.",alpha oscillation; episodic memory; memory consolidation; remote memory; theta oscillation; visual search; SHARP-WAVE RIPPLES; VISUAL EXPLORATION; POSTEROMEDIAL CORTEX; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; SPATIAL MEMORY; RESPONSES; MONKEYS; ACTIVATION; THALAMUS; SYSTEMS

The retrograde tracer experiments demonstrate projections to the FAG that arise primarily from the medial prefrontal areas 25, 32, and 10m, anterior cingulate, and dorsomedial areas 24b and 9, select orbital areas 14c, 13a, Iai, 12o, and caudal 12l, and ventrolateral area 6v. Only scattered cells were retrogradely labeled in other areas in the PFC. Caudal to the PFC, projections to the PAG also arise from the posterior cingulate cortex, the dorsal dysgranular, and granular parts of the temporal polar cortex, the ventral insula, and the dorsal bank of the superior temporal sulcus. Cells were also labeled in subcortical structures, including the central nucleus and ventrolateral part of the basal nucleus of the amygdala. The anterograde tracer experiments indicate that projections from distinct cortical areas terminate primarily in individual longitudinal PAG columns. The projections from medial prefrontal areas 10m, 25, and 32 end predominantly in the dorsolateral columns, bilaterally. Fibers from orbital areas 13a, Iai, 12o, and caudal 12l terminate primarily in the ventrolateral column, whereas fibers from dorsomedial areas 9 and 24b terminate mainly in the lateral column. The PFC areas that project to the PAG include most of the areas previously defined as the medial prefrontal network. The areas that comprise this network represent a visceromotor system, distinct from the sensory related orbital network.

The present study examined with quantitative immunohistochemical methods the presence of glutamate in spinothalamic tract terminals of owl monkeys (Aotus trivirgatus). Such terminals in the posterior region, in which a nucleus was recently identified as a specific pain and temperature relay in macaques and humans, were labeled by anterograde transport of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, injected into the spinal dorsal horn. Glutamate-like immunoreactivity was demonstrated with a postembedding immunogold procedure using a well-characterized glutamate antiserum. Quantitative analysis of the immunogold labeling demonstrated that the spinothalamic tract terminals contained more than twice the tissue average of glutamate-like immunoreactivity. Enrichment of glutamate-like immunoreactivity was also found in terminals of presumed cortical origin. Presynaptic dendrites, cell bodies and non-vesicle-containing dendrites diplayed low levels of glutamate-like immunoreactivity. A strong positive correlation (r=0.69; P<0.0001) was found between the density of synaptic vesicles and the density of gold particles in spinothalamic tract terminals, in contrast to a weak negative relationship (r=-0.28; P=0.089) present in GABAergic presynaptic dendrites. These data provide strong evidence that the gold labeling in the spinothalamic tract terminals represents transmitter labeling, implying that glutamate is a neurotransmitter for ascending nociceptive and thermoreceptive information in primates.",immunohistochemistry; thalamus; glutamate; pain; monkey; NON-NMDA RECEPTORS; SUBSTANCE-P; DORSAL HORN; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; IMMUNOGOLD ANALYSIS; SYNAPTIC TERMINALS; CAT THALAMUS; SPINAL-CORD; AMINO-ACIDS; RAT

In two cases the lesions were limited to the left thalamus, and in the third the right thalamus was involved. These deficits were associated with ipsilateral diencephalic, striatal, and dorsolateral prefrontal hypoperfusion. The damage implicated the ventral anterior nucleus, the mamillothalamic tract, and the rostroventral internal medullary lamina. These findings suggest that medial thalamic damage involving the ventral and rostral sector of the dorsal thalamus will concurrently affect functionally and neurally distinct limbodiencephalic pathways and diencephalic connections with the frontal cortex. A review of the neuropsychological and neuroimaging findings from previously reported cases with vascular lesions of the thalamus further supports this contention. The presence of frontal lobe-related cognitive deficits, though not obligatorily related to the memory problems, may contribute to some aspects of the memory deficits and affect the nature of the memory disorder observed in some cases with diencephalic amnesia.",nan; DISTURBANCE FOLLOWING INFARCTION; PARAMEDIAN THALAMIC INFARCTION; LEFT DORSOMEDIAL NUCLEUS; RHESUS-MONKEY; KORSAKOFFS SYNDROME; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; BASAL FOREBRAIN; MEMORY SYSTEM; LESIONS; PROJECTIONS

Various mechanisms, including divergence of preexisting connections, expression of latent synapses, and sprouting of new synapses, have been proposed to explain such phenomena, which probably underlie altered sensory experiences associated with limb amputation and peripheral nerve injury in humans. Putative cortical mechanisms have received the greatest emphasis but there is increasing evidence for substantial reorganization in subcortical structures, including the brainstem and thalamus, that may be of sufficient extent to account for or play a large part in representational plasticity in somatosensory cortex. Recent studies show that divergence of ascending connections is considerable and sufficient to ensure that small alterations in map topography at brainstem and thalamic levels will be amplified in the projection to the cortex. In the long term, slow, deafferentation-dependent transneuronal atrophy at brainstem, thalamic, and even cortical levels are operational in promoting reorganizational changes, and the extent to which surviving connections can maintain a map is a key to understanding differences between central and peripheral deafferentation.",divergence and convergence; neuronal atrophy; reorganization; thalamus; brainstem; lemniscal pathways; neurotransmitters; PERIPHERAL-NERVE INJURY; DORSAL-ROOT GANGLION; ADULT OWL MONKEYS; INTRATHALAMIC AUGMENTING RESPONSES; BICUCULLINE-INDUCED ALTERATIONS; FREQUENCY-DISCRIMINATION TASK; PRINCIPAL SENSORY NUCLEUS; PRIMARY AFFERENT-FIBERS; CUNEATE NUCLEUS; MACAQUE MONKEYS

To examine the role of the anterior ventrolateral thalamic nucleus (VLa) in motor control, extracellular single-cell recordings were made from the VLa nucleus in three conscious monkeys performing visually triggered, rapid movements requiring flexion and extension of the wrist joint. The movement paradigms consisted of three components: an initial hold period, a ballistic movement, and a final hold period. 2. Cerebellar nuclear stimulation was used to physiologically identify thalamic neurons receiving input from the cerebellum. Neurons subsequently confirmed histologically as lying within the VLa nucleus were located anterior to those ''driven'' by cerebellar stimulation. 3. The activities of 261 VLa neurons displaying movement-related behavior were examined. In the absence of movement, the activity of these neurons ranged from 5 to 80 spikes/s, the majority of cells (222/261; 85%) firing between 10 and 30 spikes/s. Neural activity was not influenced by afferent input from skin, joint, or muscle but altered markedly when the animal engaged in active movement. 4. The relationship between neural activity and movement at a specific joint was determined in 189 of the 261 neurons. The majority of these neurons (161/189; 85%) modulated their activity in response to movement confined to a single joint; the remaining neurons displayed multijoint motor responses, their activity being best related to a motor act, such as grasping, reaching, or feeding. There was no clear segregation in the representation of body parts in the VLa nucleus to suggest the presence of clearly defined somatotopy. 5. The activities of wrist-related neurons (45 of the 261) were examined to determine the motor characteristics of the VLa nucleus. Three distinctive activity patterns were exhibited by these neurons during the performance of the movement paradigms: 1) a phasic burst of <300 ms in duration (34/45; 76%); 2) a sustained change in neural activity lasting >300 ms (typically up to 1,000 ms; 4/45; 9%); and 3) both a phasic and a sustained response, the sustained response occurring either prior or subsequent to the phasic response (7/45; 15%). 6. The movement-related activity of the wrist-related neurons occurred late, 52% firing after the onset of the forearm electromyogram (EMG). In 47% of the neurons, discharge rate was related to movement direction and, in a smaller proportion (13%), joint position. No relationship was found between neural activity patterns and amplitude of movement or velocity of movement. 7. The timing and pattern of neural activity in VLa indicates that it is unlikely that cells in this nucleus are involved in the selection or activation of muscles for the initiation of a motor action or the coding of the physical parameters of movement.",nan; SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA; GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; BASAL GANGLIA; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; MACACA-MULATTA; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; SEQUENTIAL MOVEMENTS; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; NEURONAL DISCHARGE; BEHAVING MONKEY

Here we have explored the types of neurons in the macaque vestibular nuclei targeted by nodulus/ventral uvula inhibition using orthodromic identification from the caudal vermis. We found that all nodulus-target neurons are tuned to vestibular stimuli, and most are insensitive to eye movements. Such non-eye-movement neurons are thought to project to vestibulo-spinal and/or thalamo-cortical pathways. Less than 20% of nodulus-target neurons were sensitive to eye movements, suggesting that the caudal vermis can also directly influence vestibulo-ocular pathways. In general, response properties of nodulus-target neurons were diverse, spanning the whole continuum previously described in the vestibular nuclei. Most nodulus-target cells responded to both rotation and translation stimuli and only a few were selectively tuned to translation motion only. Other neurons were sensitive to net linear acceleration, similar to otolith afferents. These results demonstrate that, unlike the flocculus and ventral paraflocculus which target a particular cell group, nodulus/ventral uvula inhibition targets a large diversity of cell types in the vestibular nuclei, consistent with a broad functional significance contributing to vestibulo-ocular, vestibulo-thalamic and vestibulo-spinal pathways.",nan; ANGULAR VESTIBULOOCULAR REFLEX; PURSUIT EYE-MOVEMENTS; BRAIN-STEM NEURONS; SECONDARY VESTIBULOCEREBELLAR PROJECTIONS; RETROGRADE AXONAL-TRANSPORT; INNERVATING OTOLITH ORGANS; INDIVIDUAL PURKINJE-CELLS; MODULATE SIMPLE SPIKES; DORSAL Y-GROUP; SQUIRREL-MONKEY

The radiosynthesis of 2-F-18-fluoro-3-[2-((S)-3-pyrrolinyl)methoxy]pyridine (F-18-nifene) was accomplished in 2.5 h with an overall radiochemical yield of 40-50%, decay corrected. The specific activity was estimated to be approx. 37-185 GBq/mu mol. In vitro alltoradiography in rat brain slices indicated selective binding of F-18-nifene to anteroventral thalamic (AVT) nucleus, thalamus, subiculum, striata, cortex and other regions consistent with alpha 4 beta 2 receptor distribution. Rat cerebellum showed some binding, whereas regions in the hippocampus had the lowest binding. The highest ratio of > 13 between AVT and cerebellum was measured for F-18-nifene in rat brain slices. The specific binding was reduced (> 95%) by 300 mu M nicotine in these brain regions. Positron emission tomography imaging Study of F-18-nifene (130 MBq) in anesthetized rhesus monkey was carried Out using all ECAT EXACT HR+ scanner. PET Study showed selective maximal uptake in the regions of the anterior medial thalamus, ventro-lateral thalamus, lateral geniculate, cingulate gyrus, temporal cortex including the subiculum. The cerebellum in the monkeys showed lower binding than the other regions, Thalamus-to-cerebellum ratio peaked at 30-35 min postinjection to a value of 2.2 and subsequently reduced. The faster binding profile of F-18-nifene indicates promise as a PET imaging agent and thus needs further evaluation. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

The relative balance of flexible, goal-directed responding as compared to inflexible habitual responding is highly dependent on experience (e.g., training history in a task) and conditions under which the behavior was formed. Reinforcer devaluation tasks have been used widely across species to study the neurobiology of goal-directed behavior. In rodents, under some conditions, extended training in reinforcer devaluation tasks transforms goal-directed responses into habits, rendering the animals insensitive to devaluation. In nonhuman primates, no studies have previously evaluated the impact of extended training. Here we trained four macaques in a variant of the standard reinforcer devaluation task (Malkova et al., 1997), in which we presented objects with either a standard number of exposures (i.e., up to 55) or with a high number of exposures (i.e., up to 454). We tested for goal-directed behavior at three time points during the course of this extended training with different combinations of high- and low-repetition objects and stratified results based on whether the preferred or nonpreferred reinforcer was devalued. We found robust devaluation effects across all three cycles of training; however, the magnitude of the effect was modulated by reinforcer preference and by the relative training history of the objects. These data argue against habit formation after overtraining in the reinforcer devaluation task in macaques, a finding that is consistent with reports in humans and with tasks in rodents that employ multiple stimuli, reinforcers, and instrumental actions.",goal-directed behavior; nonhuman primate; neuroeconomics; behavioral flexibility; outcome devaluation; ORBITAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; GOAL-DIRECTED BEHAVIOR; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; BASOLATERAL AMYGDALA; MOTIVATIONAL CONTROL; TRANSIENT INACTIVATION; MEDIODORSAL THALAMUS; EXCITOTOXIC LESIONS; NEUROTOXIC LESIONS; REWARD DEVALUATION

Whether human children are vulnerable to this toxicity mechanism remains unknown, as there are no imaging techniques to capture it. Apoptosis is characterized by distinct structural features, which affect the way damaged tissue scatters ultrasound compared to healthy tissue. We evaluated whether apoptosis, triggered by the anesthetic sevoflurane in the brains of neonatal rhesus macaques, can be detected using quantitative ultrasound (QUS). Neonatal (n = 15) rhesus macaques underwent 5 h of sevoflurane anesthesia. QUS images were obtained through the sagittal suture at 0.5 and 6 h. Brains were collected at 8 h and examined immunohistochemically to analyze apoptotic neuronal and oligodendroglial death. Significant apoptosis was detected in white and gray matter throughout the brain, including the thalamus. We measured a change in the effective scatterer size (ESS), a QUS biomarker derived from ultrasound echo signals obtained with clinical scanners, after sevoflurane-anesthesia in the thalamus. Although initial inclusion of all measurements did not reveal a significant correlation, when outliers were excluded, the change in the ESS between the pre- and post-anesthesia measurements correlated strongly and proportionally with the severity of apoptotic death. We report for the first time in vivo changes in QUS parameters, which may reflect severity of apoptosis in the brains of infant nonhuman primates. These findings suggest that QUS may enable in vivo studies of apoptosis in the brains of human infants following exposure to anesthetics, antiepileptics and other brain injury mechanisms.",Apoptosis; Sevoflurane; Quantitative ultrasound; Thalamus; Brain injury; Neonatal; Development; Imaging; Primate; ACOUSTIC SCATTERING SOURCES; NORMAL RENAL PARENCHYMA; REFERENCE PHANTOM; EARLY EXPOSURE; CELL-DEATH; ISOFLURANE EXPOSURE; GENERAL-ANESTHESIA; BACKSCATTER; FETAL; CANCER

Large injections of wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase or small injections of Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin were made in the medial geniculate complex of Macaca fuscata. The terminal distributions of labeled axons in the cortex were correlated with auditory cortical fields demonstrable by different intensities of immunoreactivity for parvalbumin. Fibers from the ventral nucleus terminated mainly in layer TV and deep portion of layer III (IIIB), with additional terminations in layers I-IIIA and in layer VI. In layers IIIB-IV, a major terminal plexus was formed by a small number of dense patches, 300-500 mu m in diameter, surrounded by smaller satellite patches. The patches conformed to a similarly lobulated pattern of parvalbumin fiber immunoreactivity. Terminations of some individually labeled thalamocortical fibers were restricted to a single patch, whereas others innervated more than one patch by collateral branches. Fibers from the dorsad nuclei ending in areas of less dense parvalbumin immunoreactivity surrounding the primary auditory cortex formed much larger terminal patches centered largely in layer IIIB. Fibers from the magnocellular nucleus had relatively few terminal branches but innervated extremely wide areas by collaterals of single axons. Two types of axons arose from the magnocellular nucleus, one terminating preferentially in middle cortical layers and the other exclusively in layer I. These may arise respectively from parvalbumin- and calbindin-immunoreactive cell populations in the magnocellular nucleus.

Lamina I axons in the contralateral spinal white matter were of particular interest, because these include spinothalamic tract (STT) axons. These were clearly concentrated in the middle of the lateral funiculus, that is, in the location of the classically described lateral STT of humans. At the C1-2 level, they were more ventrally located. There was evidence of a general topography, in that lumbar axons were located superficially and cervical axons were located medially. There was some dispersion, in that a few axons were also found move dorsally and more ventrally (especially at the midthoracic level), and there was some variability between cases. In addition, ascending axons were more widely distributed in the ipsilateral white matter. These observations are consistent with prior anterograde findings in the cat. Together with clinical and other evidence, these observations indicate that lamina I neurons have an integral role in the effects of spinal lesions on pain, temperature, and itch sensations.",spinothalamic; anterolateral cordotomy; pain; lamina I; monkey; SPINOTHALAMIC TRACT NEURONS; DORSAL HORN NEURONS; LEUKOAGGLUTININ PHA-L; THALAMIC VPM NUCLEUS; SUBSTANCE-P RECEPTOR; NOXIOUS HEAT STIMULI; BEHAVIORAL THERMOSENSITIVITY; SENSORY ABNORMALITIES; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; THERMAL STIMULI

However, visual field specializations have not been studied in the dorsal visual stream, dedicated to processing visual motion and visually guided behaviors. To investigate this, we injected retrograde neuronal tracers occupying the whole visuotopic representation of the middle temporal (MT) visual area in marmoset monkeys and studied the distribution and morphology of the afferent primary visual cortex (V1) projections. Contrary to previous reports, we found a heterogeneous population of V1-MT projecting neurons distributed in layers 3C and 6. In layer 3C, spiny stellate neurons were distributed mainly in foveal representations, while pyramidal morphologies were characteristic of peripheral eccentricities. This primate adaptation of the V1 to MT pathway is arranged in a way that we had not previously understood, with abundant stellate projection neurons in the high-resolution foveal portions, suggesting rapid relay of motion information to visual area MT. We also describe that the medial portion of the inferior pulvinar (PIm), which is the main thalamic input to area MT, shows a retinotopic organization, likely reflecting the importance of this pathway during development and the establishment of area MT topography.",nonhuman primate; spiny stellate neurons; pulvinar; retinotopy; primary visual cortex; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; MIDDLE TEMPORAL AREA; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; PRIMATE CEREBRAL-CORTEX; STRIATE CORTEX; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; MACAQUE MONKEY; VISUOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; EARLY MATURATION; PULVINAR

This radioligand binds with high affinity and specificity to monkey cortical sections. Specific inhibitors of converting enzyme, lisinopril and perindoprilat compete for the radioligand binding to monkey cortex sections with inhibitory constants of 10 nM. High concentrations of angiotensin converting enzyme occur in most components of the basal ganglia including the caudate nucleus, putamen, the internal and external globus pallidus, nucleus accumbens, ventral pallidum and the reticular part of the substantia nigra. The distribution of converting enzyme in the caudate nucleus and putamen is heterogeneous, with prominent patches of higher activity. The patches in the caudate nucleus correspond closely with the acetylcholinesterase-poor striosomes. In the hypothalamus, very high levels of angiotensin converting enzyme occur in the median eminence and the pituitary stalk and high concentrations occur in the supraoptic and suprachiasmatic nuclei. Moderate, diffuse binding is observed in the median preoptic nucleus, the medial preoptic area, and in the anterior, lateral, ventromedial, posterior and arcuate nuclei. In the circumventricular organs, the subcommissural and subfornical organs exhibit high levels of angiotensin converting enzyme. The organum vasculosum of the lamina terminalis and the pineal body display moderate enzyme activities whereas the area postrema is devoid of labelling. The interpeduncular nucleus and, in the hippocampal formation, the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus are also intensely labelled. High levels of angiotensin converting enzyme activity are also detected throughout the cerebral cortex with laminations of higher activity corresponding to cell dense layers of the cortex. Layered binding is also present in the cerebellar cortex, with the most intense labelling in the molecular layer. Moderate concentrations of converting enzyme also occur in the paraventricular, medial habenula, lateral habenula and central median nuclei of the thalamus, the amygdala, the central gray, the locus coeruleus, the parabrachial nucleus and dorsal tegmental nucleus. The dorsal vagal complex, inferior olivary nucleus and the caudal subnucleus of the spinal trigeminal nucleus all display high levels of binding. Moderate, diffuse labelling is found throughout the reticular region and is also present in the gracile and cuneate nuclei. Although the overall distribution of angiotensin converting enzyme in the monkey brain resembles that in the rat, there are some striking differences. These include the high levels of binding throughout the monkey cerebral cortex and in the interpeduncular and suprachiasmatic nuclei.",nan; CENTRAL NERVOUS-SYSTEM; II RECEPTOR-BINDING; RAT-BRAIN; STRIATONIGRAL PATHWAY; BASAL GANGLIA; SUBSTANCE-P; LOCALIZATION; IMMUNOREACTIVITY; FOREBRAIN; STRIATUM

The present study examined stimulus-evoked brain activation with functional magnetic resonance imaging in male and female cynomolgus macaques following unilateral L7 spinal nerve ligation and the effects of clinical analgesics pregabalin, duloxetine, and morphine on brain activation in these macaques. A modified straight leg raise test was used to assess pain severity in awake animals and to evoke regional brain activation in anesthetized animals. The potential effects of clinical analgesics on both awake pain behavior and regional brain activation were examined. Following spinal nerve ligation, both male and female macaques showed significantly decreased ipsilateral straight leg raise thresholds, suggesting the presence of radicular-like pain. Morphine treatment increased straight leg raise thresholds in both males and females whereas duloxetine and pregabalin did not. In male macaques, the ipsilateral straight leg raise activated contralateral insular and somatosensory cortex (Ins/SII), and thalamus. In female macaques, the ipsilateral leg raise activated cingulate cortex and contralateral insular and somatosensory cortex. Straight leg raises of the contralateral, unligated leg did not evoke brain activation. Morphine reduced activation in all brain regions in both male and female macaques. In males, neither pregabalin nor duloxetine decreased brain activation compared with vehicle treatment. In females, however, pregabalin and duloxetine decreased the activation of cingulate cortex compared with vehicle treatment. The current findings suggest a differential activation of brain areas depending on sex following a peripheral nerve injury. Differential brain activation observed in this study could underlie qualitative sexual dimorphism in clinical chronic pain perception and responses to analgesics. Future pain management approaches for neuropathic pain will need to consider potential sex differences in pain mechanism and treatment efficacy.",biomarkers; functional magnetic resonance imaging; lumbar radicular pain; Macaca fascicularis; neuroimaging; neuropathic pain; sciatica; straight leg raise; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY; OSTEOARTHRITIS; NOCICEPTION; DULOXETINE; PREGABALIN; RECEPTORS; ANALGESIA; PLACEBO; MODEL

It is also a period when a large proportion of this age group engages in binge alcohol drinking (occasional consumption of four to five drinks leading to intoxication) and heavy alcohol drinking (binge drinking on >5 d in a month). Here we report on magnetic resonance imaging of developmental changes in the brain occurring during late adolescence and early adulthood (3.5-7.5 years of age) in a rhesus macaque model of alcohol self-administration. Monkeys were imaged prior to alcohol exposure, and following similar to 6 and similar to 12 months of daily (22 h/d) access to ethanol and water. The results revealed that the brain volume increases by 1ml/1.87 years throughout the late adolescence and early adulthood in controls. Heavy alcohol drinking reduced the rate of brain growth by 0.25 ml/year per 1 g/kg daily ethanol. Cortical volume increased throughout this period with no significant effect of alcohol drinking on the cortical growth rate. In subcortical regions, age-dependent increases in the volumes of globus pallidus, thalamus, brainstem, and cerebellum were observed. Heavy drinking attenuated the growth rate of the thalamus. Thus, developmental brain volume changes in the span of late adolescence to young adulthood in macaques is altered by excessive alcohol, an insult that may be linked to the continuation of heavy drinking throughout later adult life.",underage drinking; brain growth; magnetic resonance imaging; thalamus; white matter; ethanol; self administration; HEAVY-DRINKING; USE DISORDERS; CEREBELLAR VOLUME; SEX-DIFFERENCES; MATURATION; MONKEYS; AGE; INTOXICATION; CHILDHOOD; CORTEX

The local-global paradigm dissociates two hierarchical levels of auditory predictive coding by examining the brain responses to first-order (local) and second-order (global) sequence violations. Using the macaque model, we previously demonstrated that, in the awake state, local violations cause focal auditory responses while global violations activate a brain circuit comprising prefrontal, parietal and cingulate cortices. Here we used the same local-global auditory paradigm to clarify the encoding of the hierarchical auditory regularities in anesthetized monkeys and compared their brain responses to those obtained in the awake state as measured with fMRI. Both, propofol, a GABAA-agonist, and ketamine, an NMDA-antagonist, left intact or even enhanced the cortical response to auditory inputs. The local effect vanished during propofol anesthesia and shifted spatially during ketamine anesthesia compared with wakefulness. Under increasing levels of propofol, we observed a progressive disorganization of the global effect in prefrontal, parietal and cingulate cortices and its complete suppression under ketamine anesthesia. Anesthesia also suppressed thalamic activations to the global effect. These results suggest that anesthesia preserves initial auditory processing, but disturbs both short-term and long-term auditory predictive coding mechanisms. The disorganization of auditory novelty processing under anesthesia relates to a loss of thalamic responses to novelty and to a disruption of higher-order functional cortical networks in parietal, prefrontal and cingular cortices.

However, the neuronal specificity achieved with both methods is not well understood. Here we compare cell-targeted optogenetics and electrical microstimulation in the macaque monkey brain to functionally map the koniocellular lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) projection to primary visual cortex (V1). Selective activation of the LGN konio neurons with CamK-specific optogenetics caused selective electrical current inflow in the supra-granular layers of V1. Electrical microstimulation targeted at LGN konio layers revealed the same supra-granular V1 activation pattern as the one elicited by optogenetics. Taken together, these findings establish a selective koniocellular LGN influence on V1 supra-granular layers, and they indicate comparable capacities of both stimulation methods to isolate thalamo-cortical circuits in the primate brain.",nan; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; RECEPTIVE-FIELD PROPERTIES; MACAQUE STRIATE CORTEX; NEURONS IN-VIVO; GALAGO-CRASSICAUDATUS; LAMINAR ORGANIZATION; MONKEY; PATHWAYS; SYSTEM; STIMULATION

In the present study, we compared the patterns of retrograde transgene expression for the HiRet vs. NeuRet vectors by testing the cortical input system. These vectors were injected into the motor cortex in rats, marmosets, and macaques, and the distributions of retrograde labels were investigated in the cortex and thalamus. Our histological analysis revealed that the NeuRet vector generally exhibits a higher efficiency of retrograde gene transfer than the HiRet vector, though its capacity of retrograde transgene expression in the macaque brain is unexpectedly low, especially in terms of the intracortical connections, as compared to the rat and marmoset brains. It was also demonstrated that the NeuRet but not the HiRet vector displays sufficiently high neuron specificity and causes no marked inflammatory/immune responses at the vector injection sites in the primate (marmoset and macaque) brains. The present results indicate that the retrograde transgene efficiency of the NeuRet vector varies depending not only on the species but also on the input projections.",lentiviral vector; pseudotyping; retrograde gene transfer; cerebral cortex; thalamus; neuron specificity; inflammation; primates; GENE-TRANSFER; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; EFFICIENT; ACCESS; TRANSDUCTION; TRANSPORT; CIRCUIT; NUCLEUS; OUTPUT

In particular, the norepinephrine transporter is a target in the brain of many therapeutic and abused drugs. We used the selective ligand [H-3]nisoxetine, therefore, to describe autoradiographically the normal regional distribution of the norepinephrine transporter in the non-human primate central nervous system, thereby providing a baseline to which alterations due to pathological conditions can be compared. The norepinephrine transporter in the monkey brain was distributed heterogeneously, with highest levels occurring in the locus coeruleus complex and raphe nuclei, and moderate binding density in the hypothalamus, midline thalamic nuclei, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, central nucleus of the amygdala, and brainstem nuclei such as the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus and nucleus of the solitary tract. Low levels of binding to the norepinephrine transporter were measured in basolateral amygdala and cortical, hippocampal, and striatal regions. The distribution of the norepinephrine transporter in the non-human primate brain was comparable overall to that described in other species, however disparities exist between the rodent and the monkey in brain regions that play a role in such critical processes as memory and learning. The differences in such areas point to the possibility of important functional differences in noradrenergic information processing across species, and suggest the use of caution in applying findings made in the rodent to the human condition.

These fibers are composed of a dense plexus of thin beaded axons which ensheath an unstained central core. Such structures are not confined to the globus pallidus, but are also present in the bed nucleus of the stria terminals, the hypothalamus, the dorsal part of the amygdala, and ventrally in the basal forebrain. The present study describes the relationship between projections from the rostral and ventral striatum and the enkephalin- and substance P-positive wooly fibers. Following injections of either tritiated amino acids or the lectin PHaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin in the ventral striatum, anterogradely labeled fibers and terminals in the forebraine were visualized simultaneously with enkephalin- or substance P immunoreactivity in the same tissue section in order to determine: (i) the extent to which the woolly fiber distribution represents striatal output systems; (ii) whether woolly fibers can be considered as a marker for the entire striatal forebrain projection; and (iii) whether enkephalin and substance P are involved differentially in distinct ventral striatopallidal pathways. Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin labeling is seen in the globus pallidus and adjacent structures either as single, beaded fibers or in a profile strikingly similar to that of woolly fibers. In tissue sections treated for a double immunohistochemical protocol, following which the Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin-immunoreactive fibers turn black and the peptidergic woolly fibers brown; many of the lectin-positive fibers are seen to enter the peptide-positive woolly fiber plexus. Likewise, following the injections with tritiated amino acids in the ventral striatum, coarse structures that have dimensions resembling those of the woolly fibers are identified. In sections immunohistochemically stained and subsequently treated for autoradiography, peptide-positive woolly fibers can be identified underlying the silver strains. In sections stained for both peptide immunoreactivity and tracer substances, enkephalin or substance P-positive woolly fibers are present in all pallidal regions that receive ventral striatal input. However, the ventral striatum also sends fibers to the hypothalamus, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, the dorsal part of the amygdala, the septum, the preoptic area, and other areas of the basal forebrain. In these nuclei the peptide-positive woolly fiber distribution is less extensive than the terminal labeling. The distribution of substance P-positive fibers in the subcommissural pallidal region is more limited than the distribution of enkephalinergic fibers. The distribution of substance P wooly fibers coincides well with the distribution of inputs from the most ventral striatal region including the nucleus accumbens and the ventral putamen. These results suggest that enkephalin- and substance P-positive woolly fibers outside the pallidum appear to represent striatal efferent projections. However, these peptide-positive woolly fibers are not a marker for the full extent of the striatal projections. Finally, substance P immunoreactivity in the region beneath the anterior commissure arises from the most ventral portion of the ventral striatum, in particular the nucleus accumbens and the ventral putamen.",nan; SUBSTANCE-P IMMUNOREACTIVITY; GLOBUS PALLIDUS; BASAL GANGLIA; NUCLEUS ACCUMBENS; AFFERENT CONNECTIONS; MEDIODORSAL THALAMUS; MACACA-FASCICULARIS; OLFACTORY TUBERCLE; PROJECTIONS; RAT

In contrast, the projections from the pulvinar nucleus to the cortex are less clearly defined. The pulvinar projects predominantly to layer I in V1, and layer IV in extrastriate areas. These projection patterns suggest that the pulvinar nucleus most strongly influences (drives) activity in cortical areas beyond V1. Should this hypothesis be true, one would expect the spatiotemporal responses evoked by pulvinar activation to be different in V1 and extrastriate areas, reflecting the different connectivity patterns. We investigated this issue by analyzing the spatiotemporal dynamics of cortical visual areas' activity following thalamic electrical microstimulation in tree shrews, using optical imaging and voltage-sensitive dyes. As expected, electrical stimulation of the dLGN induced fast and local responses in V1, as well as in extrastriate and contralateral cortical areas.

In slow-wave sleep, spindles (7-16 Hz) are a prominent spontaneous oscillation generated by thalamic circuits and triggered by cortical slow waves. In wakefulness and under anesthesia, brief peripheral sensory stimuli can evoke 10-Hz reverberations due potentially to similar thalamic mechanisms. Functionally, sleep spindles and peripherally evoked spindles may play a role in memory consolidation and perception, respectively. Yet, rarely have the circuits involved in these two rhythms been compared in the same animals and never in primates. Here, we investigated the entrainment of primary somatosensory cortex (S1) neurons to both rhythms in ketamine-sedated macaques. First, we compared spontaneous spindles in sedation and natural sleep to validate the model. Then, we quantified entrainment with spike-field coherence and phase-locking statistics. We found that S1 neurons entrained to spontaneous sleep spindles were also entrained to the evoked spindles, although entrainment strength and phase systematically differed. Our results indicate that the spindle oscillations triggered by top-down spontaneous cortical activity and bottom-up peripheral input share a common cortical substrate. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Brief sensory stimuli evoke 10-Hz oscillations in thalamocortical neuronal activity and in perceptual thresholds. The mechanisms underlying this evoked rhythm are not well understood but are thought to be similar to those generating sleep spindles. We directly compared the entrainment of cortical neurons to both spontaneous spindles and peripherally evoked oscillations in sedated monkeys. We found that the entrainment strengths to each rhythm were positively correlated, although with differing entrainment phases, implying involvement of similar networks.",entrainment; primate; sleep spindles; somatosensory cortex; PHASE-LOCKING; ALPHA-OSCILLATIONS; HIPPOCAMPAL THETA; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SLEEP SPINDLES; MECHANISMS; INTERNEURONS; POTENTIALS; PATTERNS; NUCLEUS

We further analyzed this structural functional relationship by comparing the developmental pattern of TNAP activity to the maturation of the thalamocortical afferents in the primate brain (Callithrix jacchus). Cortical expression of alkaline phosphatase (AP) activity reflects the sequential maturation of the modality-specific sensory areas. Within the visual cortex, the regional and laminar distribution of AP correlates with the differential maturation of the magno- and parvocellular streams. AP activity, which is transiently expressed in the white matter, exhibits a complementary distributional pattern with myelin staining. Ultrastructural analysis revealed that AP activity is localized exclusively to the myelin-free axonal segments, including the node of Ranvier. It was also found that AP activity is gradually expressed in parallel with the maturation of synaptic contacts in them neuropile. These data suggest the involvement of AP, in addition to neurotransmitter synthesis previously suggested in the adult, in synaptic stabilization and in myelin pattern formation and put forward a role of AP in cortical plasticity and brain disorders.

We examined vestibular input to the periarcuate cortex in the Japanese monkey by analyzing laminar field potentials evoked by electrical Stimulation of the vestibular nerve. Laminar field potential analysis in the depths of the cerebral cortex showed that vestibular-evoked potentials consisted of early-positive and late-negative potentials and early-negative and late-positive potentials in the superficial and deep layers of the periarcuate cortex. respectively. with latencies of 4.8-6.3 ms, Suggesting that these potentials were directly conveyed to the cortex through the thalamus. These potentials were distributed continuously in the fundus, dorsal and ventral banks of the spur and the bottom of the junctional part of the arcuate sulcus and spur. This vestibular-projecting area overlapped the cortical distribution of corticovestibular neurons that were retrogradely labeled by tracer injection into the vestibular nuclei (previously reported area 6pa), and also the distribution of smooth pursuit-related neurons recorded in the periarcuate cortex including area 8 in a trained monkey.

Given the high prevalence of pain in diabetic patients and crosstalk between chemokines and opioids, it is pivotal to know whether neuroinfiammation-associated mediators are dysregulated in the central nervous system of diabetic primates. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate whether mRNA expression levels of glial markers, chemokines, and opioid receptors are altered in the spinal cord and thalamus of naturally occurring type 2 diabetic monkeys (n = 7) compared with age-matched non-diabetic monkeys (n = 6). By using RT-qPCR, we found that mRNA expression levels of both GFAP and IBA1 were up-regulated in the spinal dorsal horn (SDH) of diabetic monkeys compared with non-diabetic monkeys. Among all chemokines, expression levels of three chemokine ligand-receptor systems, i.e., CCL2-CCR2, CCL3-CCR1/5, and CCL4-CCR5, were up-regulated in the SDH of diabetic monkeys. Moreover, in the SDH, seven additional chemokine receptors, i.e., CCR4, CCR6, CCR8, CCR10, CXCR3, CXCR5, and CXCR6, were also up-regulated in diabetic monkeys. In contrast, expression levels of MOP, KOP, and DOP, but not NOP receptors, were down-regulated in the SDH of diabetic monkeys, and the thalamus had fewer changes in the glial markers, chemokines and opioids. These findings indicate that neuroin-fiammation, manifested as glial activation and simultaneous up-regulation of multiple chemokine ligands and receptors, seems to be permanent in type 2 diabetic monkeys. As chemokines and opioids are important pain modulators, this first-in-primate study provides a translational bridge for determining the functional efficacy of spinal drugs targeting their signaling cascades.

Our specific goals were to assess the prevalence and the degree of orientation tuning in the monkey LGN and to determine if the preferred stimulus orientations of LGN neurons varied as a function of receptive-field position. The primary motivation for this research was to gain insight into the receptive-field configuration of LGN neurons and consequently into the neural mechanisms which determine the spatial organization of LGN receptive fields in primates. In both the parvocellular and magnocellular layers, the responses of the majority of individual neurons to sine-wave gratings varied as a function of stimulus orientation. The influence of stimulus orientation was, however, highly dependent on the spatial characteristics of the stimulus; the greatest degree of orientation bias was observed for spatial frequencies higher than the cell's optimal spatial frequency. On a population basis, the degree of orientation bias was similar for all major classes of LGN neurons (e.g. ON vs. OFF center; parvocellular vs. magnocellular) and did not vary systematically with receptive-field eccentricity. At a given receptive-field location, LGN neurons, particularly cells in the parvocellular laminae, tended to prefer either radially oriented stimuli or stimuli oriented more horizontally than their polar axis. Our analyses of the orientation-dependent changes in spatial-frequency response functions, which was based on the Soodak et al., (1987; Soodak, 1986) two-dimensional, difference-of-Gaussian receptive-field model, suggested that the orientation bias in LGN neurons was due to an elongation of the receptive-field center mechanism which in some cases appeared to consist of multiple subunits. Direct comparisons of the orientation-tuning characteristics of LGN cells and their retinal inputs (S potentials) indicated that the orientation bias in the monkey LGN reflects primarily the functional properties of individual retinal ganglion cells.

We report the development and evaluation of a putative antagonist, 5-(3'-fluoropropyl)-3-(2-(S)-pyrrolidinylmethoxy)pyridine (nifrolidine) as a PET agent for nicotine alpha(4)beta(2) receptors. Methods: In vitro binding affinity of nifrolidine was measured in rat brain slices labeled with I-125-iodoepibatidine or I-125-bungaratoxin. Selectivity of binding was measured in the presence of cytisine. F-18 radiolabeling was performed by reacting the tosylate precursor with F-18-fluoride followed by cleprotection. In vitro autoradiographic studies in rat brain slices with 5-(3'-F-18-fluoropropyl)-3-(2-(S)-pyrrolidinylmethoxy)pyridine (F-18-nifrolidine) were read on a phosphor imager. Rats were injected with F-18-nifrolidine (3.7 MBq each), and brain regions were counted at various times (2-120 min). Blocking studies were performed by subcutaneous injection of nicotine (10 mg/kg). A PET study of F-18-nifrolidine (approximately 148 MBq) was performed on an anesthetized rhesus monkey using a high-resolution scanner. Results: In vitro binding affinity of nifrolidine exhibited an inhibition constant of 2.89 nmol/L for the alpha(4)beta(2) sites. Radiosynthesis and high-performance liquid chromatography purifications yielded the product in approximately 20%-40% decay-corrected radiochemical yield to provide 18F-nifrolidine specific activities of approximately 111-185 GBq/mumol. In vitro autoradiography in rat brain slices revealed selective binding of F-18-nifrolidine to the anteroventral thalamic nucleus, ventral posteriomedial thalamus, dorsolateral geniculate, and, to a lesser extent, cortex and striata, which are known to contain alpha(4)beta(2) sites. This specific binding was completely abolished by 300 mumol/L nicotine. Ex vivo rat brain distribution studies indicated selective binding in the thalamus with a maximal thalamus-to-cerebellum ratio of approximately 3. The PET study revealed selective maximal uptake (0.01 % injected dose/mL) in regions of the thalamus (anteroventral and anteromedial mus, ventrolateral thalamus) and extrathalamic regions such as cingulate gyrus, lateral geniculate, temporal cortex, and frontal cortex. Conclusion: Binding of F-18-nifrolidine to alpha(4)beta(2) receptor-rich regions in rats and monkeys indicates promise as a PET agent. Additionally, the thalamus-to-cerebellum ratio approached a plateau of 1.7 in 120 min, indicating relatively faster kinetics compared with previously reported imaging agents.",alpha(4)beta(2) nicotine receptors; PET; F-18; nifrolidine; ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; IN-VIVO; HUMAN-BRAIN; BINDING-SITES; IMAGING AGENT; AGONIST; SUBTYPES; ANALOGS; LIGAND; BIODISTRIBUTION

CPSP is hypothesized to be caused by maladaptive reorganization between various brain regions. The treatment for CPSP has not been established; however, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to the primary motor cortex has a clinical effect. To verify the functional reorganization hypothesis for CPSP development and rTMS therapeutic mechanism, we longitudinally pursued the structural and functional changes of the brain by using two male CPSP model monkeys (Macaca fuscata) developed by unilateral hemorrhage in the ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus. Application of rTMS to the ipsilesional primary motor cortex relieved the induced pain of the model monkeys. A tractography analysis revealed a decrease in the structural connectivity in the ipsilesional thalamocortical tract, and rTMS had no effect on the structural connectivity. A region of interest analysis using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging revealed inappropriately strengthened functional connectivity between the ipsilesional mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus and the amygdala, which are regions associated with emotion and memory, suggesting that this may be the cause of CPSP development. Moreover, rTMS normalizes this strengthened connectivity, which may be a possible therapeutic mechanism of rTMS for CPSP.",nan; nan

However, it is unclear whether the same intervention would be effective for thermal hyperalgesia. Therefore, using the macaque model, we examined behavioural responses to thermal stimuli following pharmacological inactivation of the PIC/SII. Methods Two CPSP model macaques were established based on collagenase-induced unilateral hemorrhagic lesions in the ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus. To evaluate pain perception, withdrawal latencies to thermal stimuli of 37, 45, 50, 52, and 55 degrees C to hands were measured. Several weeks after the lesion induction, pharmacological inactivation of the PIC/SII by microinjection of muscimol was performed. The effect of inactivation on withdrawal latency was assessed by comparison with withdrawal latency after vehicle injection. Results Several weeks after induction of the thalamic lesions, both macaques demonstrated a reduction in withdrawal latencies to thermal stimulation (<50 degrees C) on the contralesional hand, indicating the occurrence of thermal hyperalgesia. When the PIC/SII were inactivated by muscimol, the withdrawal latencies to thermal stimuli of 50 and 52 degrees C were significantly increased compared to those after vehicle injection. Conclusions Our data emphasize that increased activity in the PIC/SII after appearance of thalamic lesions can contribute to abnormal pain of multiple modalities, and the modulation of PIC/SII activity may be a therapeutic approach for thermal hyperalgesia. Significance CPSP is caused by stroke lesions in the sensory system and characterized by mechanical allodynia or thermal hyperalgesia. Inactivation of the PIC/SII has an analgesic effect on mechanical allodynia; however, it is not clear whether the same intervention could reduce thermal hyperalgesia. Here, using the macaque model, we demonstrated that inactivation of these cortices reduces hypersensitivity to thermal stimuli. This result emphasizes that increased PIC/SII activity can contribute to abnormal pain of multiple modalities.",nan; CENTRAL POSTSTROKE PAIN; INSULAR CORTEX; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; MOTOR CORTEX; REPRESENTATIONS; ALLODYNIA; STIMULATION; LESION; MODEL; HEAT

Not only were movements evoked from motor areas (PMC and M1), but they were also evoked from posterior parietal (5, 7a, 7b) and anterior parietal areas (3b, 1, 2). Large representations of digit movements involving only the index finger (D2) and thumb (D1), were elicited from areas 1, 2, 7b, and M1. Other movements evoked from these regions were similar to ethologically relevant movements that have been described in other primates. These include combined forelimb and mouth movements and full hand grasps. However, many other movements were much more complex and could not be categorized into any of the previously described ethological categories. Movements involving specific digits, which mimic precision grips, are unique to macaques and have not been described in New World or prosimian primates. We propose that these multiple and expanded motor representations of the digits co-evolved with the emergence of the opposable thumb and alterations in grip type in some anthropoid lineages.",grasping; posterior parietal cortex; primate; reaching; somatosensory cortex; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; IPSILATERAL CORTICAL CONNECTIONS; COMPLEX MOVEMENTS; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; MUSCLE SYNERGIES; AREA 5; THALAMOCORTICAL CONNECTIONS; SOMATOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; POSTSPIKE FACILITATION

Because nerve fibers reflect local skin deformations, they individually carry ambiguous signals about object features. In contrast, cortical neurons exhibit heterogeneous response properties that reflect computations applied to convergent input from multiple classes of afferents, which confer to them a selectivity for behaviorally relevant features of objects. The conventional view is that these complex response properties arise within the cortex itself, implying that sensory signals are not processed to any significant extent in the two intervening structures-the cuneate nucleus (CN) and the thalamus. To test this hypothesis, we recorded the responses evoked in the CN to a battery of stimuli that have been extensively used to characterize tactile coding in both the periphery and cortex, including skin indentations, vibrations, random dot patterns, and scanned edges. We found that CN responses are more similar to their cortical counterparts than they are to their inputs: CN neurons receive input from multiple classes of nerve fibers, they have spatially complex receptive fields, and they exhibit selectivity for object features. Contrary to consensus, then, the CN plays a key role in processing tactile information.",touch; neural coding; receptive fields; vibration; integration; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; MECHANORECEPTIVE AFFERENTS; TARGET NEURONS; ISOFLURANE; HAND; CORTEX; TOUCH; RAT; REPRESENTATION; TRANSMISSION

According to the classical view, orientation tuning arises from the integration of untuned input from thalamic neurons with aligned but spatially displaced receptive fields (RFs). In a recent microneurography study with human subjects, the precise temporal structure of the responses of individual mechanoreceptive afferents to scanned edges was found to carry information about their orientation. This putative mechanism could in principle contribute to or complement the classical rate-based code for orientation. In the present study, we further examine orientation information carried by mechanoreceptive afferents of Rhesus monkeys. To this end, we record the activity evoked in cutaneous mechanoreceptive afferents when edges are indented into or scanned across the skin. First, we confirm that information about the edge orientation can be extracted from the temporal patterning in afferent responses of monkeys, as is the case in humans. Second, we find that while the coarse temporal profile of the response can be predicted linearly from the layout of the RF, the fine temporal profile cannot. Finally, we show that orientation signals in tactile afferents are often highly dependent on stimulus features other than orientation, which complicates putative decoding strategies. We discuss the challenges associated with establishing a neural code at the somatosensory periphery, where afferents are exquisitely sensitive and nearly deterministic.",nan; RAPIDLY ADAPTING MECHANORECEPTORS; METRIC-SPACE ANALYSIS; VISUAL-CORTEX; CUTANEOUS MECHANORECEPTORS; STIMULUS ORIENTATION; FLUTTER-VIBRATION; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; HUMAN HAND; PRECISION; PERCEPTION

Nuclei involved in representation and regulation of the organism's internal state contain CB, whereas those involved in the representation of the external environment and the representation or execution of externally directed actions contain only PV. Moreover, our findings indicate that different nuclei known as components of the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS) contain either CB or PV or both, suggesting that this system in primates operates with both CB and PV. In line with previously reported findings, we also found that unmyelinated pathways contain only CB, whereas myelinated pathways contain PV. Distribution of CB and PV in the macaque brainstem follows a pattern comparable to, but in some instances significantly different than, the pattern previously reported in the rat. We argue that the nonoverlapping distribution of CB and PV among different structures of the brainstem might reflect underlying differences in the physiological, anatomic, and perhaps phylogenetic properties of these structures. Considering our recent findings of selective vulnerability of brainstem structures to Alzheimer's disease, the present data suggest that the majority of macaque brainstem nuclei that contain CB are vulnerable to neurofibrillary tangles in humans. By contrast, only few nuclei that contain PV exhibit pathologic changes. Some of these nuclei are affected with a high number of neuritic plaques without ever developing neurofibrillary tangles.",brain; myelin; primate; evolution; calcium; CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEINS; LAMINA-I NEURONS; INTRALAMINAR THALAMIC NUCLEI; PERIAQUEDUCTAL GRAY-MATTER; PONTINE PARABRACHIAL AREA; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; EFFERENT PROJECTIONS; BASAL FOREBRAIN; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; PHA-L

It has been disputed whether visual experience is necessary for the formation of ocular dominance columns. To settle this issue, fetal monkeys were delivered prematurely by Caesarean section at embryonic day 157 (E157), 8 d before the end of normal gestation, To avoid light exposure, the Caesarean section and all subsequent feedings and procedures were done in absolute darkness, using infrared night-vision goggles. Tritiated proline was injected into the right eye 1 d after delivery (E158). One week later at postnatal age 0 (P0), the equivalent of a full-term pregnancy (E165/P0), alternate sections of unfolded and flattened visual cortex were prepared for autoradiography or cytochrome oxidase (CO). All three newborns studied at E165/P0 had well segregated ocular dominance columns organized into the characteristic mosaic present in adults. In the upper layers, a mature pattern of CO patches (also known as blobs or puffs) was visible, aligned with the ocular dominance columns in layer IVc. Every other row of patches in layers II,III was labeled by [H-3]proline, In V2, a distinct system of alternating thick-pale-thin-pale CO stripes was present. These findings indicate that stimulation of the retina by light is not necessary for the development of columnar systems in the visual cortex.

In controls, cholinergic innervation of the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus was distributed heterogeneously in densely labelled patches surrounded by less heavily stained matrix. In patients with progressive supranuclear palsy, the density of choline acetyltransferase-positive varicosities decreased by 75% in the matrix and 60% in the patches. The number of choline acetyltransferase-positive cell bodies decreased by 84% in the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, but more moderately (-33%) in the substantia innominata. In patients with senile dementia of Alzheimer type, choline acetyltransferase-positive varicosities decreased by 34% in the matrix, but 46% in the patches. Choline acetyltransferase-labelled cell bodies were spared in the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus, whereas severe loss (-80%) was observed in the substantia innominata. These results suggest that cholinergic innervation of mediodorsal nucleus matrix derives mainly from the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus and mediodorsal nucleus patches from the substantia innominata.

However, the postnatal development of the amygdala is not easily explored at the cellular level in humans. Here we performed a stereological analysis of the macaque monkey amygdala in order to characterize the cellular changes underlying its normal structural development in primates. The lateral, basal, and accessory basal nuclei exhibited the same developmental pattern, with a large increase in volume between birth and 3 months of age, followed by slower growth continuing beyond 1 year of age. In contrast, the medial nucleus was near adult size at birth. At birth, the volume of the central nucleus was half of the adult value; this nucleus exhibited significant growth even after 1 year of age. Neither neuronal soma size, nor neuron or astrocyte numbers changed during postnatal development. In contrast, oligodendrocyte numbers increased substantially, in parallel with an increase in amygdala volume, after 3 months of age. At birth, the paralaminar nucleus contained a large pool of immature neurons that gradually developed into mature neurons, leading to a late increase in the volume of this nucleus. Our findings revealed that distinct amygdala nuclei exhibit different developmental profiles and that the amygdala is not fully mature for some time postnatally.

Although many anatomical and physiological studies suggest a role for the PPTN in the control of conditioned behavior and associative learning, the detailed characteristics of saccade- and visual-related activities of PPTN neurons remain unclear. We recorded the activity of PPTN neurons in monkeys (Macaca fuscata ) during visually guided saccade tasks, and examined the response properties of saccade- and visual-related activities such as time course, direction selectivity and contextual modulation. Saccade-related activity occurred either during saccade execution or after saccade end. The preferred directions of the neuronal activity were biased toward the contralateral and upward sides. Half of the saccade-related neurons showed activity modulation only for task saccades and not for spontaneous saccades outside the task. Visually-responsive neurons responded with short latencies. Some responded to the appearance of the visual stimulus in a directionally selective manner, and others responded to both the appearance and disappearance of the visual stimulus in a directionally non-selective manner. Many of these neurons exhibited distinct visual responses to the appearance of two different stimuli presented under different stages of the task, whereas a population of the neurons responded equally to the disappearance of the two stimuli. Thus, many PPTN neurons exhibited context-dependent activity related to the visuomotor events, consistent with a role in controlling conditioned behavior.",brainstem; cholinergic neuron; Macaca fuscata; Parkinson's disease; visuomotor control; CONDITIONED MOTOR-PERFORMANCE; MIDBRAIN DOPAMINERGIC-NEURONS; NIGRA PARS RETICULATA; SINGLE-UNIT ACTIVITY; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; EYE-MOVEMENTS; VISUOMOTOR FUNCTIONS; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; CENTRAL THALAMUS

However, the effect of fetal irradiation on cognitive functions that are vulnerable in schizophrenia (e.g., working memory) has not been examined. Methods: Four fetally irradiated macaque monkeys (FIMs) and four age-matched controls (CONs) were tested as juveniles (12-30 months) and again as adults (similar to 5 years) on delayed spatial response (DR), a working memory task that is dependent on intact prefrontal cortical circuitry. Results: As juveniles, seven of eight monkeys learned DR; one FIM refused to test. Performance in the two groups was not different. As adults, only one FIM achieved criterion on DR. Three of four FIMs did not reach criterion at the 0-sec delay interval of the DR task, whereas all four CONs mastered DR at the maximum tested delay of 10 sec. FIMs completed fewer DR test sessions compared with CONs. In contrast, all FIMs and three of four CONs learned an associative memory task, visual pattern discrimination. Conclusions: Fetal exposure to irradiation resulted in an adult-onset cognitive impairment in the working memory domain that is relevant to understanding the developmental etiology of schizophrenia.",Attention; neurodevelopment; prefrontal cortex; schizophrenia; thalamus; working memory; PRENATAL EXPOSURE; WORKING-MEMORY; RHESUS-MONKEYS; SCHIZOPHRENIA; SYMPTOMS; LESIONS; RISK

Here, we extend this work by estimating the time course of fMRI signal changes in the cortical and subcortical regions found to exhibit evidence for task-related activation. Our results indicate that there are separate loci of signal changes in the thalamus (dorsomedial and pulvinar) that exhibit notable differences in times of onset, peak and return to baseline of signal changes. The signal changes in the pulvinar demonstrate the slowest transients of all the cortical and subcortical regions we examined. Evaluation of cortical regions demonstrated salient differences as well, with the signal changes in Brodmann area 6 (BA6) rising, peaking, and returning to baseline earlier than those detected in other regions. We conclude that BA6 mediates early designation or refinement of search criteria, and that the pulvinar may be involved in the binding of feature stimuli for an integrated object memory.",semantic memory; thalamus; fMRI; TEMPORAL CORRELATION HYPOTHESIS; INFERIOR PREFRONTAL CORTEX; VISUAL FEATURE INTEGRATION; FUNCTIONAL-ANATOMY; VERB GENERATION; RHESUS-MONKEY; BRAIN; KNOWLEDGE; ACTIVATION; BINDING

This dendrite extends upward from somas of pyramidal neurons, the most numerous neurons of the cortex. The apical dendrite is embedded in a recurrent corticothalamic circuit that induces surges of electric current to move repeatedly down the dendrite. Narrow bandwidths of surge frequency (resonating) enable cortical circuits to use specific carrier frequencies, which isolate the processing of those circuits from other circuits. Resonating greatly enhances the intensity and duration of electrical activity of a neuron over a narrow frequency range, which underlies attention in its various modes. Within the minicolumn, separation of the central resonating circuit from the surrounding signal processing network separates having subjective impressions from thinking about them. Resonating neurons in the insular cortex apparently underlie cognitive impressions of feelings. (C) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Different types of TC neurons in mice, humans, and macaques have distinct morphologies, distinct connectivity patterns, and convey different aspects of visual information to the cortex. To investigate the molecular underpinnings of these cell types, and how these relate to differences in dLGN between human, macaque, and mice, we profiled gene expression in single nuclei and cells using RNA-sequencing. These efforts identified four distinct types of TC neurons in the primate dLGN: magnocellular (M) neurons, parvocellular (P) neurons, and two types of koniocellular (K) neurons. Despite extensively documented morphological and physiological differences between M and P neurons, we identified few genes with significant differential expression between transcriptomic cell types corresponding to these two neuronal populations. Likewise, the dominant feature of TC neurons of the adult mouse dLGN is high transcriptomic similarity, with an axis of heterogeneity that aligns with core vs. shell portions of mouse dLGN. Together, these data show that transcriptomic differences between principal cell types in the mature mammalian dLGN are subtle relative to the observed differences in morphology and cortical projection targets. Finally, alignment of transcriptome profiles across species highlights expanded diversity of GABAergic neurons in primate versus mouse dLGN and homologous types of TC neurons in primates that are distinct from TC neurons in mouse.",nan; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; GABAERGIC NEURONS; MOUSE; TRANSCRIPTOMICS; ARCHITECTURE; DIVERSITY; EVOLUTION; PATHWAY; CORTEX

We selected the macaque monkey neocortex because of its clear areal subdivisions, large surface area, protracted development (gestation = 165 d), and similarity to the human brain. In situ hybridizations, performed at early [embryonic day 65 (E65)], middle (E80), and late (E95) stages of cortical development, revealed that EphA system family members are expressed in distinct gradients and laminar and areal domains in the embryonic neocortex. Indeed, several regionally restricted molecular patterns are already apparent within the cortical plate at E65, before the formation of thalamocortical connections, suggesting that the initial expression of some EphA system members is regulated by programs intrinsic to cortical cells. For example, EphA3, EphA6, and EphA7 are all selectively expressed within the presumptive visual cortex. However, although EphA6 and EphA7 are present throughout this region, EphA3 is only expressed in the prospective extrastriate cortex, suggesting that cortical cells harbor functional biases that may influence the formation of appropriate synaptic connections. Although several patterns of early gene expression are stable (e.g., EphA3, EphA4, and EphA6), others change as development proceeds (e.g., EphA5, EphA7, ephrin-A2, ephrin-A3, and ephrin-A5), perhaps responding to extrinsic cues. Thus, at E95, after connections between the cortical plate and thalamus have formed, receptor subtypes EphA3, EphA5, EphA6, and EphA7 and the ligand ephrin-A5 are expressed in posterior regions, whereas EphA4 and ephrin-A2 and ephrin-A3 are either uniformly distributed or anteriorly biased. Taken together, our results demonstrate molecular distinctions among cells of the embryonic primate neocortex, revealing hitherto unrecognized compartmentalization early in corticogenesis.",corticogenesis; Eph; ephrin; area-specific gene expression; protomap; specification; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; RECEPTOR TYROSINE KINASES; NEURAL CREST MIGRATION; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; MACAQUE MONKEY; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; THALAMOCORTICAL PROJECTIONS; REGIONAL SPECIFICATION; BILATERAL ENUCLEATION

However, the neuromechanism underlying the effects of ephedrine addiction still remains unclear. Our study aimed to establish chronic ephedrine addiction models in rhesus monkeys and to investigate the neuromechanism of chronic ephedrine addiction using the behavioural methods combined with resting-state blood oxygenation level dependent-functional magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-fMRI). Monkeys in the ephedrine addiction group (n = 6) received intramuscular injections of ephedrine using a dose escalation method, with a chronic model established in 8 weeks, while in the control group (n = 4), monkeys received a pure 0.9% saline injection. The weight and behaviors of the monkeys were observed throughout the treatment. All monkeys underwent the brain MR scans for two times (before treatment and after treatment had been discontinued). After molding, the weight of the ephedrine group was significantly reduced, while the weight of the control group increased significantly. Compared with the control group, the ephedrine addicted monkeys showed more abnormal behaviors related to addiction. In fMRI study, the ephedrine addicted monkeys showed more increased brain activation than that of the control group, mainly including the prefrontal cortex(PFC) and anterior cin-gulate cortex (ACC), the left ventral tegmental area(VTA), right insula, right amygdala, hippocampus, left thalamus, and left cerebellum.We hypothesize that the principal neuromechanism underlying chronic ephedrine addiction involves multiple abnormal brain neuron circuits, mainly in the PFC and the limbic system, and is closely related to addictive behaviors.",Ephedrine addiction; Neuromechanism; Rhesus monkey; Behavioural; Resting-state fMRI; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; HEROIN; ACTIVATION; ABUSE; RAT; DOPAMINE; MEMORY

Each of these tracers share the common features of high affinity for mGluR5 (0.08-0.23 nM vs. rat mGluR5) and moderate lipophilicity (log P 2.8-3.4). Compound 1b was synthesized using a Suzuki or Stille coupling reaction with [C-11]MeI. Compounds 2b and 3b were synthesized by a SNAr reaction using a 3-chlorobenzonitrile precursor. Autoradiographic studies in rhesus monkey brain slices using 2b and 3b showed specific binding in cortex, caudate, putamen, amygdala, hippocampus, most thalamic nuclei, and lower binding in the cerebellum. PET imaging studies in monkey showed that all three tracers readily enter the brain and provide an mGluR5-specific signal in all gray matter regions, including the cerebellum. The specific signal observed in the cerebellum was confirmed by the autoradiographic studies and saturation binding experiments that showed tracer binding in the cerebellum of rhesus monkeys. In vitro metabolism studies using the unlabeled compounds showed that 1a, 2a, and 3a are metabolized slower by human liver microsomes than by monkey liver microsomes. In vivo metabolism studies showed 3b to be long-lived in rhesus plasma with only one other more polar metabolite observed.

There were sparser inputs to the central lateral nucleus of the inferior pulvinar, locations in the lateral and medial pulvinar, and the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus.

Manual dexterity, of great evolutionary significance to the primates, ranges in complexity from the precise opposition of finger and thumb to Brendal playing Mozart. All dexterity depends on a sustained and rapid transfer of sensorimotor information between the cerebral cortex and the cervical spinal cord. 2. Multiple separate corticospinal neuron populations originate from cortical areas four, the supplementary motor area, anterior cingulate, postarcuate, parietal and insular cortex. Each corticospinal neuron population projects in parallel to all spinal segments, and has a distinctive pattern of terminations. 3. Each corticospinal neuron population has a unique thalamic input which can relay particular sensorimotor information from the sense organs, cerebellum and basal ganglia. The overall structural framework of these sensorimotor pathways, with many parallel corticospinal channels, with interconnections in the cerebral cortex and spinal cord to enable crosstalk between the channels, is that needed for parallel distributed processing, which would enable the very rapid transfer of information between the cerebral cortex and spinal cord needed for any sophisticated use of the hand. 4. Hemisection of the cervical spinal cord in the macaque results in an immediate hemiplegia, with subsequent remarkable although incomplete recovery of hand and finger movements. The only direct corticospinal input to the hemicord caudal to the hemisection, even after 3 years, is the similar to 10% of flbres which cross the midline caudal to the lesion: the fibres 'spared' by the hemisection, A matching 'sparing' of somatosensory input from the paresed limb also occurs. No regeneration of the interrupted pathways has been visualized using modern tracer techniques. 5. Cervical hemisection permanently reduces the number of parallel channels which transmit information between cortex acid spinal cord, but does not reduce their cortical origins nor the neuron populations targeted in the spinal cord. We infer that the content of the information that can be transmitted between the cortex and spinal cord is not greatly changed, but the rate of transmission of this information is sharply reduced, and is the 'bottleneck' that limits the complete recovery of dexterity following hemisection. The remarkable recovery that does occur presumably reflects more economic transmission of information by the few spared channels. We guess that this involves substantial synaptic reorganization not visualized by the procedures we have used.",cerebral cortex; corticospinal neurons; macaque monkey; parallel distributed processing; spinal hemisection; POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; MACAQUE MONKEY; THALAMIC PROJECTIONS; SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; CORTICAL AREAS; MOVEMENTS; REPRESENTATIONS; MAPS

At 3 days after rabies injections into proximal forelimb, distal forelimb and hindlimb representations of the macaque MI, second-order neurons via the thalamus were labeled in the deep cerebellar nuclei, including the dentate (DN), anterior interpositus (AIN) and posterior interpositus nuclei. In the DN, the labeling of both the forelimb and hindlimb was seen mainly in the dorsal aspect. The labeling of the hindlimb was located rostral to that of the forelimb and the labeling of the proximal forelimb was located slightly rostral to that of the distal forelimb. The same rostrocaudal arrangement was observed in the AIN. In the posterior interpositus nucleus, however, labeling from the MI hindlimb and forelimb representations largely overlapped. At the 4-day postinjection period, third-order labeling occurred in Purkinje cells of the cerebellar hemisphere. The Purkinje cell labeling from the forelimb representation, including the proximal and distal regions, was observed primarily in lobules IV-VI and crus I. The proximal forelimb labeling was both rostral and lateral to that of the distal forelimb within lobules IV-VI. However, the hindlimb labeling was seen both rostral and lateral to that of the proximal forelimb within lobules III-VI. These results indicate that the hindlimb, proximal forelimb and distal forelimb are arranged rostrocaudally in the DN and AIN, whereas there is dual somatotopy along the rostrocaudal and lateromedial axes in the cerebellar cortex.",dentate nucleus; macaque monkey; motor control; Purkinje cell; rabies virus; transneuronal labeling; RETROGRADE TRANSNEURONAL TRANSPORT; RABIES VIRUS; CORTICOSTRIATAL PROJECTIONS; CORTICOPONTINE PROJECTION; INTERMEDIATE CEREBELLUM; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; ADULT-RAT; ORGANIZATION

In the lateral LP nucleus, there are fewer glomerular arrangements, fewer GABAergic terminals, and fewer cholinergic terminals. Correspondingly, the neuropil of the lateral LP nucleus appears to be composed of a higher percentage of small type I cortical terminals (RS profiles). Similar to the pulvinar nucleus and the LGN, the cholinergic terminals present in the lateral LP nucleus contact both GABA-negative profiles (thalamocortical cells; 74%) and GABA-positive profiles (interneurons; 26%). However, in contrast to the pulvinar nucleus and the LGN, the majority of cholinergic terminals in the lateral LP nucleus contact small-caliber dendritic shafts outside of glomeruli (60 of 82; 73%). Consequently, most cholinergic terminals are in close proximity to RS profiles. Therefore, whereas the cholinergic input to the LGN and pulvinar nucleus appears to be positioned to selectively influence the response of thalamocortical cells to terminals that innervate glomeruli (retinal terminals or large type II cortical terminals), the cholinergic input to the lateral LP nucleus may function primarily in the modulation of responses to terminals that innervate distal dendrites (small type I cortical terminals).

INFLUENCE OF AFFERENT DRIVING ON SPINE ACQUISITION AND DENDRITIC GROWTH OF LAYER-4C SPINY STELLATE NEURONS,"This study uses Golgi-impregnated material to examine the effects of altering the nature of afferent driving on the maturation of spines and dendrites on thalamic recipient spiny stellate neurons in layers 4C alpha and beta of the monkey striate cortex. These two laminae receive input from different sets of thalamic afferents with different functional properties. The development of dendritic spine and dendritic branch populations on these neurons in experimental animals is compared to the same features on similar groups of neurons in a series of normal animals described in the preceding study (Lund and Holbach, '91). Three conditions of rearing were used to alter afferent driving from normal: complete darkness (with in some cases return to normal diurnal light-dark cycle), bilateral eye lid suture, and monocular eye lid suture. Some of the normal and dark-reared infant monkeys were examined behaviorally for visual capacity in an earlier study (Regal et al., '76). All conditions of abnormal afferent driving caused changes from the normal developmental patterns of spine and dendritic arbor growth in these first-order neurons of the cortex and each condition differed in the nature of change produced. Major findings of this study are: 1. Vigorous spine acquisition and dendritic growth occurs under all conditions of visual deprivation on alpha and beta neurons. Eventual spine and dendritic attrition occurs under at least conditions of bilateral or monocular lid suture to produce a rather constant adult morphology. We assume, therefore, that visually driven activity is a modulator or shaper of the developmental process for thalamic recipient neurons of visual cortex, rather than being an initiator, terminator, or driving force for their maturation. 2. An innate clock, whose nature is unknown but is apparently not driven by visual input, initiates and terminates a period of growth of the thalamic recipient neurons between birth and 30-32 weeks of age. 3. Factors controlling dendritic arbor growth and retraction are different from those controlling spine synapse addition or attrition. 4. Whereas the alpha and beta neurons normally show quite different early growth patterns between birth and 30 weeks of age, when both eyes are simultaneously deprived of vision, an early temporal and numerical convergence occurs in patterns of spine population development on the two groups of neurons. This convergent pattern assumes a different form in dark-reared and lid-sutured animals. This suggests that the different patterns of development normally seen in the alpha and beta neurons depend on receiving different patterns of afferent driving, not on innate differences between alpha and beta neurons or links to different afferent axon populations independent of activity patterns. 5. Monocular suture was found to affect aspects of spine acquisition and dendritic growth of layer 4C neurons after 30 weeks of age. This may be due to a lack of development of layer 4C synaptic connections normally supporting binocular interactions in more superficial layers.",VISION; DENDRITIC SPINES; SENSORY DEPRIVATION; CEREBRAL CORTEX; OCULAR DOMINANCE COLUMNS; VISUAL-CORTEX; MACACA-NEMESTRINA; MONOCULAR DEPRIVATION; MACAQUE MONKEY; SYNAPSES; AREA-17; RAT; PLASTICITY; RECOVERY

Understanding the principles of neuroanatomical organization in these structures is critical to understanding the functions they perform and ultimately how the human brain works. We have manually distilled and synthesized hundreds of primate neuroanatomy facts into a single interactive visualization. The resulting picture represents the fundamental neuroanatomical blueprint upon which cognitive functions must be implemented. Within this framework we hypothesize and detail 7 functional circuits corresponding to psychological perspectives on the brain: consolidated long-term declarative memory, short-term declarative memory, working memory/information processing, behavioral memory selection, behavioral memory output, cognitive control, and cortical information flow regulation. Each circuit is described in terms of distinguishable neuronal groups including the cerebral isocortex (9 pyramidal neuronal groups), parahippocampal gyrus and hippocampus, thalamus (4 neuronal groups), basal ganglia (7 neuronal groups), metencephalon, basal forebrain, and other subcortical nuclei. We focus on neuroanatomy related to primate nonprimary cortical systems to elucidate the basis underlying the distinct homotypical cognitive architecture.

The spinothalamic tract (STT) is an integral pathway in the transmission of nociceptive information to the brain, yet the stage of development when axons from cells in the spinal cord reach the thalamus is unknown. Therefore, the retrograde tracer Fluoro-Gold was used to characterize the STT at several stages of development in the mouse, a species in which the STT was previously unexamined. One-week-old, 2-day-old and embryonic-day-18 mice did not differ from adults in the number or distribution of retrogradely labeled SIT neurons. Approximately 3,500 neurons were retrogradely labeled from one side of the thalamus in each age group. Eighty percent of the labeled cells were located on the side of the spinal cord contralateral to the injection site. Sixty-three percent of all labeled cells were located within the cervical cord, 18% in thoracic cord, and 19% in the lumbosacral spinal cord. Retrogradely labeled cells significantly increased in diameter over the first postnatal week. Arborizations and boutons within the ventrobasal complex of the thalamus were observed after the anterograde tracer biotinylated dextran amine was injected into the neonatal spinal cord. These data indicate that, whereas neurons of the STT continue to increase in size during the postnatal period, their axons reach the thalamus before birth and possess some of the morphological features required for functionality.

Neuroimaging studies have identified neural circuits underlying these responses in cocaine-dependent subjects. But these studies are often difficult to interpret because of the heterogeneity of the participants, substances abused, and differences in drug histories and social variables. Therefore, the goal of this study was to assess the functional effects of exposure to cocaine-associated stimuli in a non-human primate model of cocaine self-administration, providing precise control over these variables, with the 2-[C-14]deoxyglucose method. Rhesus monkeys self-administered 0.3mg/kg/injection cocaine (n=4) under a fixed-interval 3-minute (FI 3-min) schedule of reinforcement (30 injections/session) for 100 sessions. Control animals (n=4) underwent identical schedules of food reinforcement. Sessions were then discontinued for 30 days, after which time, monkeys were exposed to cocaine- or food-paired cues, and the 2-[C-14]deoxyglucose experiment was conducted. The presentation of the cocaine-paired cues resulted in significant increases in functional activity within highly restricted circuits that included portions of the pre-commissural striatum, medial prefrontal cortex, rostral temporal cortex and limbic thalamus when compared with control animals presented with the food-paired cues. The presentation of cocaine-associated cues increased brain functional activity in contrast to the decreases observed after cocaine consumption. Furthermore, the topography of brain circuits engaged by the expectation of cocaine is similar to the distribution of effects during the earliest phases of cocaine self-administration, prior to the onset of neuroadaptations that accompany chronic cocaine exposure.",Cocaine; craving; cue reactivity; glucose utilization; rhesus monkey; self-administration; CEREBRAL GLUCOSE-UTILIZATION; DEOXYGLUCOSE METHOD; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; LUMPED CONSTANT; RHESUS-MONKEYS; FOS EXPRESSION; DRUG CUES; REWARD; RESPONSES

Metabolic mapping studies in cocaine users and animal models have shown extensive functional alterations throughout the striatum, limbic system, and cortex. Few studies, however, have evaluated the persistence of these effects following cessation of cocaine availability. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to assess the functional effects of re-exposure to cocaine in nonhuman primates after the discontinuation of cocaine self-administration for 30 or 90 days, using the quantitative autoradiographic 2-[C-14]deoxyglucose (2DG) method. Rhesus monkeys self-administered cocaine (fixed interval 3-min schedule, 30 infusions per session, 03 mg/kg/infusion) for 100 sessions followed by 30 (n = 4) or 90 days (n = 3) during which experimental sessions were not conducted. Food-reinforced control animals (n = 5) underwent identical schedules of reinforcement. Animals were then re-exposed to cocaine or food for one final session and the 2DG method applied immediately after session completion. Compared to controls, re-exposure to cocaine after 30 or 90 day drug-free periods resulted in lower rates of glucose utilization in ventral and dorsal striatum, prefrontal and temporal cortex, limbic system, thalamus, and midbrain. These data demonstrate that vulnerability to the effects of cocaine persists for as long as 90 days after cessation of drug use. While there was some evidence for recovery (fewer brain areas were affected by cocaine re-exposure at 90 days as compared to 30 days), this was not uniform across regions, thus suggesting that recovery occurs at different rates in different brain systems.

Eight human hemispheres were sectioned in comparable planes parallel to the ACPC plane. Microscopic slices were labeled with DiI and analyzed with confocal laser and polarized light microscopy. Three distinct systems of fibers were detected. Single fibers run from the caudate nucleus to the lentiform nucleus. The anterior thalamic peduncle connects the mediodorsal and partially the anterior thalamic nucleus with the frontal lobe. The frontopontine tract system connects the frontal lobe with the pens. This fiber tract occupies 38% of the anterior limb and is arranged in small bands. Right-left comparison of morphometric parameters of these bundles demonstrated that more and smaller bundles were located on the left-hand side than on the right-hand side. Tendencies for this configuration were noticeable in all brains investigated, with statistical significance in one brain. These morphological differences correlate with functional differences, as it was possible to demonstrate right hemispheric dysfunctions in cases of OCD. The benefit of anterior capsulotomy in OCD is generally seen in the interruption of fronto-basal ganglia-thalamic loops by disconnecting the anterior thalamic peduncle. In addition, the frontopontine fiber tract is disconnected in this stereotactic procedure. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

Two types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) carrying S-cone signals (blue-On and blue-Off cells) project to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) in the thalamus. In all primates, these S-cone signals are relayed through the dust-like' (konis in classical Greek) dLGN cells. In New World primates such as common marmoset, these very small cells are known to form distinct and spatially extensive, koniocellular layers. Although in Old World primates, such as macaques, koniocellular layers tend to be very thin, the adjacent parvocellular layers contain distinct koniocellular extensions. It appears that all S-cone signals are relayed through such konio cells, whether they are in the main koniocellular layers or in their colonies within the parvocellular layers of the dLGN. In the primary visual cortex, these signals begin to merge with the signals carried by the other two principal parallel channels, namely the magnocellular and parvocellular channels. This article will also review the possible routes taken by the S-cone signals to reach one of the topographically organised extrastriate visual cortical areas, the middle temporal area (area MT). This area is the major conduit for signals reaching the parietal cortex. Alternative visual inputs to area MT not relayed via the primary visual cortex area (V1) may provide the neurological basis for the phenomenon of blindsight' observed in human and non-human primates, who have partial or complete damage to the primary visual cortex. Short wavelength sensitive cone (S-cone) signals to area MT may also play a role in directing visual attention with possible implications for understanding the pathology in dyslexia and some of its treatment options.",area MT; lateral geniculate nucleus; macaque; primary visual cortex; S-cones; short-wavelength sensitive cones; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; MARMOSET CALLITHRIX-JACCHUS; MIDDLE TEMPORAL AREA; MACAQUE MONKEY; STRIATE CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; DEVELOPMENTAL DYSLEXIA; KONIOCELLULAR PATHWAY

These include cortico-ponto-cerebellar projections originating throughout cerebral cortex, in addition to projections from the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum to prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices via the thalamus. Such projections likely serve as important substrates for cerebellar involvement in human cognition, assuming their analogues are prominent in the human brain. These connections can be examined from a functional perspective through the use of functional connectivity MRI (FCMRII), a technique that allows the in vivo examination of coherence in MR signal among functionally related brain regions. Using this approach, low-frequency fluctuations in MR signal in the dentate nucleus correlated with signal fluctuations in cerebellar, thalamic, limbic, striatal, and cerebrocortical regions including parietal and frontal sites, with prominent coherence in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. These findings indicate that FCMR1 is a useful tool for examining functional relationships between the cerebellum and other brain regions, and they support the findings from non-human primate studies showing anatomic projections from cerebellum to regions of cerebral cortex with known involvement in higher cognitive functions. To our knowledge, this represents the first demonstration of functional coherence between the dentate nucleus and parietal and prefrontal cortices in the human brain, suggesting the presence of cerebellar-parietal and cerebellar-prefrontal functional connectivity.

Afferent and efferent projections were selectively labeled by applications of the lipophilic tracers Dil and DiA in aldehyde-fixed brains of 12-18-d-old rat embryos (E12-E18; gestation: 21 d). On E12 and E13, the neocortical anlage consists of a ventricular zone and a preplate, with no extracortical connections. By E14, just prior to the appearance of the cortical plate, polymorphic cells located in the ventrolateral preplate of the telencephalic vesicle send out the first group of corticofugal axons toward the ganglionic eminence. Shortly thereafter, the cortical plate emerges as a dense band of radially oriented cells that also contribute to the corticofugal projection. By E15, axons of the early cortical projection cells cascade through the striatal primordium, the future site of the internal capsule. At the time of cortical plate formation and initial corticofugal axon outgrowth, ascending corticopetal axon systems have not yet arrived in the neocortex. Double-labeling experiments in which one dye is placed in the neocortex and the other in the ipsilateral dorsal thalamus reveal that cortical efferents encounter the first ascending wave of thalamofugal axons at the level of the striatum. Collectively, these two axonal systems bridge the neocortex and the diencephalon. Upon their arrival in the neocortex on E16, thalamic axons follow a ventrolateral to dorsomedial course within the intermediate zone. Thalamic axons are the first subcortical afferent system to arrive in the neocortex. Other ascending afferent systems arising from the midbrain tegmentum enter the neocortex after E17. Comparison of thalamocortical and tegmentocortical projections in two halves of the same brain and across various embryonic ages clearly reveals that the two projection systems differ in their trajectories as well as in their time of arrival. Present observations challenge the view that the precocious arrival of subcortical axons provides the impetus for cortical maturation, and suggest that cortical plate differentiation and the initial organization of corticofugal projection patterns occur independent of ascending pathways.",nan; SOMATIC SENSORY CORTEX; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; CAT FELIS-DOMESTICA; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; CORTICAL AREAS; RHESUS-MONKEY; THALAMOCORTICAL AFFERENTS; NEOCORTICAL HISTOGENESIS; ASCENDING PATHWAYS

The goal of this study was to compare the effective connectivity of dorsal pulvinar (dPul) and LIP and to probe the dependency of microstimulation effects on task demands and spatial tuning properties of a given brain region. To this end, we applied unilateral electrical microstimulation in the dPul (mainly medial pulvinar) and LIP in combination with event-related BOLD fMRI in monkeys performing fixation and memory-guided saccade tasks. Microstimulation in both dPul and LIP enhanced task-related activity in monosynaptically-connected frontoparietal cortex and along the superior temporal sulcus (STS) including putative face patch locations, as well as in extrastriate cortex. LIP microstimulation elicited strong activity in the opposite homotopic LIP while no homotopic activation was found with dPul stimulation. Both dPul and LIP stimulation also elicited activity in several heterotopic cortical areas in the opposite hemisphere, implying polysynaptic propagation of excitation. Despite extensive activation along the intraparietal sulcus evoked by LIP stimulation, there was a difference in frontal and occipital connectivity elicited by posterior and anterior LIP stimulation sites. Comparison of dPul stimulation with the adjacent but functionally dissimilar ventral pulvinar also showed distinct connectivity. On the level of single trial timecourses within each region of interest (ROI), most ROIs did not show task-dependence of stimulation-elicited response modulation. Across ROIs, however, there was an interaction between task and stimulation, and task-specific correlations between the initial spatial selectivity and the magnitude of stimulation effect were observed. Consequently, stimulation-elicited modulation of task-related activity was best fitted by an additive model scaled down by the initial response amplitude. In summary, we identified overlapping and distinct patterns of thalamocortical and corticocortical connectivity of pulvinar and LIP, highlighting the dorsal bank and fundus of STS as a prominent node of shared circuitry. Spatial task-specific and partly polysynaptic modulations of cue and saccade planning delay period activity in both hemispheres exerted by unilateral pulvinar and parietal stimulation provide insight into the distributed interhemispheric processing underlying spatial behavior.",Memory saccades; Eye movements; Fixation; Spatial selectivity; Macaque monkeys; LATERAL INTRAPARIETAL AREA; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL SULCUS; INFERIOR PARIETAL LOBULE; VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; ELECTRICAL MICROSTIMULATION; MEDIAL PULVINAR; DECISION-MAKING; CORTICOTHALAMIC CONNECTIONS; RETINOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; TOPOGRAPHIC ORGANIZATION

Whether DBS devices are compatible with higher field MRI scanning is unknown. This study aimed to investigate whether 7.0 T and 3.0 T MRI scans can be safely performed on rhesus monkeys with implanted DBS devices. MethodsEight male rhesus monkeys were included in this study and stereotactically implanted with DBS devices in the left anterior thalamus. Two weeks after DBS device implantation, 7.0 T and 3.0 T MRI scans were performed. The monkeys were observed for 72 hours. After explantation of the DBS system, 7.0 T MRI was repeated to determine potential lesions. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and transmission electron microscopy were conducted to assess pathological alterations. ResultsIn both groups, the monkeys exhibited no behavioral changes related to neurological deficits. Post-explantation MRI showed no malacia foci surrounding the DBS tracks. Additionally, neither hematoxylin and eosin staining nor transmission electron microscopy showed clear injury near the DBS leads. ConclusionThese results indicate that no obvious heating injury was induced in the tissue surrounding the DBS leads by the 7.0 T and 3.0 T MRI scans. Although the results of this study may not be generalizable, these data suggest that patients with implanted DBS devices can undergo even 7.0 T MRI without risk of brain injury.",Deep brain stimulation; heating injury; magnetic resonance imaging; rhesus monkey; ultrahigh; EPILEPTIC MONKEYS; MRI; ELECTRODES; NUCLEUS; DISEASE; COIL; SAR

This paper focuses on our current knowledge of the dynamics the receptive field (RF) as broken down into the classical receptive field (CRF) and the extra-classical receptive field (ECRF) in primate LGN. CRFs in the LGN are known to be similar to those in the retinal ganglion cell layer in terms of both spatial and temporal characteristics, leading to the standard interpretation of the LGN as a relay center from retina to primary visual cortex. ECRFs have generally been found to be large and inhibitory, with some differences in magnitude between the magno-, parvo-, and koniocellular pathways. The specific contributions of the retina, thalamus, and visual cortex to LGN ECRF properties are presently unknown. Some reports suggest a retinal origin for extra-classical suppression based on latency arguments and other reports have suggested a thalamic origin for extra-classical suppression. This issue is complicated by the use of anesthetized animals, where cortical activity is likely to be altered. Thus further study of LGN ECRFs is warranted to reconcile these discrepancies. Producing descriptions of RF properties of LGN neurons could be enhanced by employing preferred naturalistic stimuli. Although there has been significant work in cats with natural scene stimuli and noise that statistically imitates natural scenes, we highlight a need for similar data from primates. Obtaining these data may be aided by recent advancements in experimental and analytical techniques that permit the efficient study of nonlinear RF characteristics in addition to traditional linear factors. In light of the reviewed topics, we conclude by suggesting experiments to more clearly elucidate the spatial and temporal structure of ECRFs of primate LGN neurons. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Here, we demonstrate that this cortical OFF dominance is modulated by the size and spatial frequency of the stimulus in awake primates and we uncover a main neuronal mechanism underlying this modulation. We show that large grating patterns with low spatial frequencies drive five times more OFF-dominated than ON-dominated neurons, but this pronounced cortical OFF dominance is strongly reduced when the grating size decreases and the spatial frequency increases, as when the stimulus moves away from the observer. We demonstrate that the reduction in cortical OFF dominance is not caused by a selective reduction of visual responses in OFF-dominated neurons but by a change in the ON/OFF response balance of neurons with diverse receptive field properties that can be ON or OFF dominated, simple, or complex. We conclude that cortical OFF dominance is continuously adjusted by a neuronal mechanism that modulates ON/OFF response balance in multiple cortical neurons when the spatial properties of the visual stimulus change with viewing distance and/or optical blur.",area V1; receptive field; thalamocortical; thalamus; visual cortex; CELL RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; COMPLEX CELLS; ORIENTATION SELECTIVITY; MACAQUE V1; FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE; GANGLION-CELLS; CORTEX; REPRESENTATION; SEGREGATION; PERCEPTION

To help identify possible subregions within the nucleus accumbens, the distribution of calbindin was examined in two additional monkeys. Although this revealed evidence of core- and shell-like regions within the accumbens, these different regions could not consistently be related to cytoarchitectonic features. The rostral amygdala sent nearly equivalent projections to both the medial and the lateral portions of nucleus accumbens, whereas projections arising from the middle and caudal amygdala terminated preferentially in the medial division of nucleus accumbens. The basal nucleus was the major source of these amygdala efferents, and there was a crude topography as parts of the basal and accessory basal nuclei terminated in different parts of nucleus accumbens. The subiculum was the major source of hippocampal projections to the nucleus accumbens, but some hippocampal efferents also originated in the parasubiculum, the prosubiculum, the adjacent portion of CA1, and the uncal portion of CA3. These hippocampal projections, which coursed through the fornix, showed a rostrocaudal gradient as more arose in the rostral hippocampus. Hippocampal efferents terminated most densely in the medial and ventral portions of nucleus accumbens, along with light label in the adjacent olfactory tubercle. The entorhinal projections were more evenly distributed between the medial nucleus accumbens and the olfactory tubercle, whereas the perirbinal projections were primarily to the olfactory tubercle. These cortical inputs were less reliant on the fornix.

The PPN is involved in initiation and modulation of gait and other stereotyped motor behaviors and is inter-connected with the pallido-thalamo-cortical circuit. Internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) DBS is effective at treating the motor signs associated with PD, however its impact on MRGPA is limited and its effect on PPN neuronal activity is unknown. The current work characterizes the effect of therapeutically-effective GPi DBS on PPN neuronal activity in a single rhesus monkey made parkinsonian using 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). A scaled-down, quadripolar DBS lead was implanted into sensorimotor GPi under electrophysiological and stereotactic guidance. Single-neuron activity was recorded from PPN before, during and after DBS. GPi DBS reduced the mean discharge rate of PPN neurons from 16.8 Hz to 12.8 Hz, with 30 (66.7%) neurons showing a decreased mean rate, 3 (6.7%) increased and 12 (26.7%) unchanged. Consistent with known GABAergic projections from GPi to PPN, and with previous observations that stimulation increases output from the stimulated structure, GPi DBS suppressed activity in the PPN. The present observations, together with previous reports of improvement in MRGPA during low frequency stimulation in PPN, suggest that activation of PPN output may be required to improve MRGPA and may account for the lack of improvement in MRGPA typically observed with GPi or subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS.

Nonetheless, careful testing shows that certain visually guided behaviours can persist even in the absence of visual awareness(1-4). The neural circuits supporting this phenomenon, which is often termed blindsight, remain uncertain(4). Here we demonstrate that the thalamic lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) has a causal role in V1-independent processing of visual information. By comparing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and behavioural measures with and without temporary LGN inactivation, we assessed the contribution of the LGN to visual functions of macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta) with chronic V1 lesions. Before LGN inactivation, high-contrast stimuli presented to the lesion-affected visual field (scotoma) produced significant V1-independent fMRI activation in the extrastriate cortical areas V2, V3, V4, V5/middle temporal (MT), fundus of the superior temporal sulcus (FST) and lateral intraparietal area (LIP) and the animals correctly located the stimuli in a detection task. However, following reversible inactivation of the LGN in the V1-lesioned hemisphere, fMRI responses and behavioural detection were abolished. These results demonstrate that direct LGN projections to the extrastriate cortex have a critical functional contribution to blindsight. They suggest a viable pathway to mediate fast detection during normal vision.",nan; VISUAL RESPONSE PROPERTIES; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; AREA MT; STRIATE CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; GANGLION-CELLS; AFFERENT BASIS; PROJECTION; NEURONS; ACTIVATION

The generalized convulsion of amygdala kindled cats became asymmetrical or changed into partial seizures by callosal bisection. The fully-kindled amygdala seizure of a split-brain epileptic baboon and rhesus monkey was a hemiconvulsion or an asymmetrical generalized convulsion. The amygdala-kindled bisymmetrical generalized convulsion of the epileptic baboon was changed into a hemiconvulsion or an asymmetrical generalized convulsion. These results indicate that the corpus callosum plays an imoprtant, although not exclusive, role in bilateralization of epileptic activity, and its role becomes more important when the animal ascends the phylogenetic scale.",SEIZURE GENERALIZATION; KINDLING; INTERHEMISPHERIC PATHWAYS; SURGICAL DESTRUCTION; CATS; SUBHUMAN PRIMATES; nan

Most physiological studies of single neurons in the auditory cortex have focused on the onset and sustained portions of evoked responses, but there have been far fewer studies on the relationship between onset and offset responses. In the current study, we compared spectral and spatial tuning of onset and offset responses of neurons in primary auditory cortex (A1) and the caudolateral (CL) belt area of awake macaque monkeys. Several different metrics were used to determine the relationship between onset and offset response profiles in both frequency and space domains. In the frequency domain, a substantial proportion of neurons in A1 and CL displayed highly dissimilar best stimuli for onset-and offset-evoked responses, although even for these neurons, there was usually a large overlap in the range of frequencies that elicited onset, and offset responses and distributions of tuning overlap metrics were mostly unimodal. In the spatial domain, the vast majority of neurons displayed very similar best locations for onset-and offset-evoked responses, along with unimodal distributions of all tuning overlap metrics considered. Finally, for both spectral and spatial tuning, a slightly larger fraction of neurons in A1 displayed nonoverlapping onset and offset response profiles, relative to CL, which supports hierarchical differences in the processing of sounds in the two areas. However, these differences are small compared with differences in proportions of simple cells (low overlap) and complex cells (high overlap) in primary and secondary visual areas. NEW & NOTEWORTHY In the current study, we examine the relationship between the tuning of neural responses evoked by the onset and offset of acoustic stimuli in the primary auditory cortex, as well as a higher-order auditory area-the caudolateral belt field-in awake rhesus macaques. In these areas, the relationship between onset and offset response profiles in frequency and space domains formed a continuum, ranging from highly overlapping to highly nonoverlapping.",auditory cortex; primate; spectral processing; spatial processing; single-unit electrophysiology; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; COMPLEX CELLS; INFERIOR COLLICULUS; CORTEX NEURONS; TONES; ARCHITECTURE; ORGANIZATION; MECHANISMS; THALAMUS; NUCLEUS

THE ROLE OF CORTICOCORTICAL LOOPS,"This paper is a sequel to an earlier paper which proposed an active role for the thalamus, integrating multiple hypotheses formed in the cortex via the thalamo-cortical loop. In this paper, I put forward a hypothesis on the role of the reciprocal, topographic pathways between two cortical areas, one often a higher area dealing with more abstract information about the world, the other 'lower', dealing with more concrete data. The higher area attempts to fit its abstractions to the data it receives from lower areas by sending back to them from its deep pyramidal cells a template reconstruction best fitting the lower level view. The lower area attempts to reconcile the reconstruction of its view that it receives from higher areas with what it knows, sending back from its superficial pyramidal cells the features in its data which are not predicted by the higher area. The whole calculation is done with all areas working simultaneously, but with order imposed by synchronous activity in the various top-down, bottom-up loops. Evidence for this theory is reviewed and experimental tests are proposed. A third part of this paper will deal with extensions of these ideas to the frontal lobe.",nan; MACAQUE MONKEY; CORTEX; CONNECTIONS; PATTERNS; V1

The nonhuman primate has been used as a model to study anxiety-related mechanisms in humans based upon similarities in behavior and the presence of a similar 5-HT transporter gene polymorphism. Stressful and threatening contexts in the nonhuman primate model have revealed 5-HT transporter genotype dependent differences in regional glucose metabolism. Using the rhesus monkey, we examined the extent to which serotonin transporter genotype is associated with 5-HT transporter binding in brain regions implicated in emotion-related pathology. Methods: Genotype data and high resolution PET scans were acquired in 29 rhesus (Macaca mulatta) monkeys. [C-11]DASB dynamic PET scans were acquired for 90 min in the anesthetized animals and images of distribution volume ratio (DVR) were created to serve as a metric of 5-HT transporter binding for group comparison based on a reference region method of analysis. Regional and voxelwise statistical analysis were performed with corrections for anatomical differences in gray matter probability, sex, age and radioligand mass. Results: There were no significant differences when comparing 1/1 homozygotes with s-carriers in the regions of the brain implicated in anxiety and mood related illnesses (amygdala, striatum, thalamus, raphe nuclei, temporal and prefrontal cortex). There was a significant sex difference in 5-HT transporter binding in all regions with females having 18%-28% higher DVR than males. Conclusions: Because these findings are consistent with similar genotype findings in humans, this further strengthens the use of the rhesus model for studying anxiety-related neuropathologies.

Results were obtained using chronic recording techniques in awake or lightly tranquilized animals. Most neurons were unable to follow the temporal order of vibrations in excess of 10 Hz. A smaller sample of cells provided faithful reproduction of frequencies up to 50-75 Hz and another responded to low amplitude, high frequency stimulation in excess of 100 Hz. Cells that displayed temporally cohesive responses to lower frequencies demonstrated predictable, time-locked discharges to successive stimulus cycles. Cells activated by higher frequencies showed a lower probability of following successive stimulus cycles. These findings are discussed in reference to the hypothesis that SII may provide a parallel channel for processing high frequency vibrotactile inputs from Pacinian receptors.",TACTILE STIMULUS; PRIMATE; PARIETAL CORTEX; SOMATOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; VIBRATORY STIMULI; SAIMIRI-SCIUREUS; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; LATERAL SULCUS; CORTEX; CATS; CONNECTIONS; FREQUENCY; THALAMUS

Its chemical structure and toxicological properties are similar to kainic acid. Like kainic acid, exposure results in extensive hippocampal degeneration. The effect of domoic acid on other primate brain structures, however, is less resolved. In an attempt to clarify this issue, the present study applied a degeneration specific histochemical technique (de Olmos' cupric-silver method) to reveal degeneration within the brains of domoic acid-dosed cynomolgus monkeys. Degenerating neuronal cell bodies and terminals were found not only within the hippocampus, but also within a number of other 'limbic' structures including the entorhinal cortex, the subiculum, the piriform cortex, the lateral septum, and the dorsal lateral nucleus of the thalamus. Although the hippocampus is a component of the original limbic circuit of Papez, other components such as the mammillary bodies, the anterior nucleus of the thalamus and the cingulate cortex contained no degeneration, while a number of more recently documented efferent targets of the hippocampal formation revealed extensive degeneration.

In addition, recent positron emission tomography studies implicate the subgenual region in depression and mania. To determine the subcortical projections of this region in primates, injections of Phaseolus vulgaris leukoagglutinin, biotinylated dextran amine, or rhodamine-labeled dextran amine were placed in area 25 in three monkeys. In contrast to the efferents from area 25 previously described in the rat, there were no projections to autonomic effector regions, such as the nucleus of the solitary tract, magnocellular neurosecretory cell groups in the hypothalamus, ventrolateral medulla, or intermediolateral column of the spinal cord. However, projections were shown to a number of structures with probable roles in autonomic function and direct connections to some of the abovementioned autonomic effector regions, including bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, perifornical and anterior hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray, and lateral parabrachial nucleus. In addition, there were projections to several forebrain structures that receive projections from other components of the medial prefrontal network including the medial part of the caudate nucleus, lateral septum. midline and mediodorsal thalamic nuclei, the lateral parvocellular part of the basal accessory amygdaloid nucleus, and the magnocellular part of the basal amygdaloid. None of the injections resulted in labeling in the medulla. These connections support the idea of a role for cortical area 25 in emotional and autonomic responses, albeit less direct than that described in rodents.

Neurophysiological studies have suggested a role for these transthalamic pathways in regulating information transmission between cortical areas. However, evidence for a causal role of the pulvinar in regulating cortico-cortical interactions is sparse and it is not known whether pulvinar's influences on cortical networks are task-dependent or, alternatively, reflect more basic large-scale network properties that maintain functional connectivity across networks regardless of active task demands. In the current study, under passive viewing conditions, we conducted simultaneous electrophysiological recordings from ventral (area V4) and dorsal (lateral intraparietal area [LIP]) nodes of macaque visual system, while reversibly inactivating the dorsal part of the lateral pulvinar (dPL), which shares common anatomical connectivity with V4 and LIP, to probe a causal role of the pulvinar. Our results show a significant reduction in local field potential phase coherence between LIP and V4 in low frequencies (4-15 Hz) following muscimol injection into dPL. At the local level, no significant changes in firing rates or LFP power were observed in LIP or in V4 following dPL inactivation. Synchronization between pulvinar spikes and cortical LFP phase decreased in low frequencies (4-15 Hz) both in LIP and V4, while the low frequency synchronization between LIP spikes and pulvinar phase increased. These results indicate a causal role for pulvinar in synchronizing neural activity between interconnected cortical nodes of a large-scale network, even in the absence of an active task state.",cortico-cortical interactions; macaque electrophysiology; pulvinar causal role; reversible-inactivation with muscimol; transthalamic pathways; DIFFUSION; OSCILLATIONS; ORGANIZATION; ATTENTION; DYNAMICS; THALAMUS; RHYTHMS; NUCLEI; ALPHA; CELLS

One of the most salient models for studying the functional specialization of parallel visual streams in the primate brain is the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the dorsal thalamus, through which the parvocellular and magnocellular channels, On-center and Off-center channels, and ipsilateral and contralateral eye channels are maintained and provide the foundation for cortical processing. We examined three aspects of neural processing in these streams: (1) the relationship between extraclassical surround suppression, a widespread visual computation thought to represent a canonical neural computation, and the parallel channels of the LGN; (2) the magnitude of binocular interaction in the parallel streams; and (3) the magnitude of suppression elicited by perceptual competition (binocular rivalry) in each stream. Our results show that surround suppression is almost exclusive to Off channel cells; further, we found evidence for two different components of monocular surround suppression-an early-stage suppression exhibited by all magnocellular cells, and a late-stage suppression exhibited only by Off cells in both the parvocellular and magnocellular pathways. This finding indicates that stream-specific circuits contribute to surround suppression in the primate LGN and suggests a distinct role for suppression in the Off channel to the cortex. We also examined the responses of LGN neurons in alert macaque monkeys to determine whether neurons that supply the cortex with visual information are influenced by stimulation of both eyes. Our results demonstrate that LGN neurons are not influenced by stimulation of the non-dominant eye. This was the case when dichoptic stimuli were presented to classical receptive fields of neurons, extraclassical receptive fields of neurons, and when stimuli were appropriate to produce the perception of binocular rivalry.",LGN; TRN; vision; thalamus; feedback; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; CLASSICAL RECEPTIVE-FIELD; BINOCULAR-RIVALRY; PERCEPTUAL SUPPRESSION; NEURONS; RESPONSES; FEEDBACK; CELLS; EYE; MECHANISMS

Much of the work on animal foraging has focused on factors relating to the amount of time and energy animals expend searching for and harvesting foods. Models that emphasize such factors have been invaluable in determining when it is beneficial for an animal to search for pastures new. When foraging, however, animals also have to determine how to direct their search. For what food should they forage? There is no point searching for more of a particular food when you are sated from eating it. Here we review work in macaques and humans that has sought to reveal the neural circuits critical for determining the subjective value of different foods and associated objects in our environment and tracking this value over time. There is mounting evidence that a network composed of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), amygdala, and medial thalamus is critical for linking objects in the environment with food value and adjusting those valuations in real time based on current biological needs. Studies using temporary inactivation methods have revealed that the amygdala and OFC play distinct yet complementary roles in this valuation process. Such a network for determining the subjective value of different foods and, by extension, associated objects, must interact with systems that determine where and for how long to forage. Only by efficiently incorporating these two factors into their decisions will animals be able to achieve maximal fitness.",orbitofrontal cortex; macaque; reward; reinforcer devaluation; selective satiation; prefrontal cortex; anthropoid primates; amygdala; ORBITAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MEDIODORSAL THALAMIC NUCLEUS; SENSORY-SPECIFIC SATIETY; RHESUS-MONKEYS FAIL; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; REINFORCER DEVALUATION; FRONTAL-CORTEX; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; REWARD VALUE; BASOLATERAL AMYGDALA

Numerous brain mechanisms probably contribute to discounting this jitter. Changes in the timing of responses in the visual thalamus associated with fixational saccades are considered in this study. Activity of single neurons in alert monkey lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) was recorded during fixation while pseudorandom visual noise stimuli were presented. The position of the stimulus on the display monitor was adjusted based on eye position measurements to control for changes in retinal locations due to eye movements. A method for extracting nonstationary first-order response mechanisms was applied, so that changes around the times of saccades could be observed. Saccade-related changes were seen in both amplitude and timing of geniculate responses. Amplitudes were greatly reduced around saccades. Timing was retarded slightly during a window of about 200 ms around saccades. That is, responses became more sustained. These effects were found in both parvocellular and magnocellular neurons. Timing changes in LGN might play a role in maintaining cortical responses to visual stimuli in the presence of eye movements, compensating for the spatial shifts caused by saccades via these shifts in timing.",Eye movements; Visual jitter; Perceptual stability; Remapping; Spatiotemporal receptive field mapping; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; EYE-MOVEMENTS; STRIATE CORTEX; HUMAN LGN; AREA MT; NEURONS; MONKEY; FIELD; TIME; PERCEPTION

In the rhesus monkey, the number of geniculate layers changes abruptly from six posteriorly (central vision) to four anteriorly (peripheral vision). The plane of transition between these patterns passes through small laminar gaps corresponding to the perceptual blind spot caused by the exit of the optic nerve from the eyeball. However, this plane of transition has no apparent functional link to the blind spot. A thermodynamic model of geniculate morphogenesis supports the hypothesis that the blind spot traps the transition in its stereotypic position by introducing a singularity in an otherwise smooth gradient in forces guiding the development of geniculate morphogenesis.

Neuroimaging is increasingly used to develop models of vPFC connections, to examine white matter (WM) integrity, and to target surgical interventions, including deep brain stimulation. We used primate (Macaca nemestrina/Macaca fascicularis) tracing studies and 3D reconstructions of WM tracts to delineate the rules vPFC projections follow to reach their targets. vPFC efferent axons travel through the uncinate fasciculus, connecting different vPFC regions and linking different functional regions. The uncinate fasciculus also is a conduit for vPFC fibers to reach other cortical bundles. Fibers in the internal capsule are organized according to destination. Thalamic fibers from each vPFC region travel dorsal to their brainstem fibers. The results show regional differences in the trajectories of fibers from different vPFC areas. Overall, the medial/lateral vPFC position dictates the route that fibers take to enter major WM tracts, as well as the position within specific tracts: axons from medial vPFC regions travel ventral to those from more lateral areas. This arrangement, coupled with dorsal/ventral organization of thalamic/brainstem fibers through the internal capsule, results in a complex mingling of thalamic and brainstem axons from different vPFC areas. Together, these data provide the foundation for dividing vPFC WM bundles into functional components and for predicting what is likely to be carried at different points through each bundle.

In one group of rats, the two tracers were injected into different barrel columns residing in the same row; in the other group of rats, the tracers were deposited into barrel columns residing in different rows. Reconstructions of labeled axonal varicosities in the neostriatum and ventrobasal thalamus were analyzed quantitatively to compare the extent of overlapping projections to these subcortical structures. For both groups of animals, corticostriatal projections terminated in densely packed clusters that occupied curved lamellar-shaped regions along the dorsolateral edge of the neostriatum. When the tracers were injected into different whisker barrel rows, the distribution of BDA- and FR-labeled terminals in the neostriatum followed a crude somatotopic organization in which the amount of overlap was approximately the same as in the ventrobasal thalamus. When both tracers were injected into the same whisker barrel row, however, the amount of corticostriatal overlap was significantly higher than the amount of overlap observed in the ventrobasal thalamus.

Previous structural MRI studies have identified regional abnormalities in grey matter, especially in the basal ganglia. These findings are consistent with the assumption of alterations in cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical circuits and dopaminergic neurotransmission playing a major role in the pathophysiology of GTS. Additionally, recent imaging studies suggested an involvement of sensory-motor cortices in the pathophysiology of GTS. However, little is known about the role of white matter changes in GTS. In this study, we aimed to examine whether GTS is associated with abnormalities in white matter microstructure and whether these changes are correlated with tic severity. In a morphometric study based on diffusion tensor MRI of the whole brain, we compared brain tissue diffusion characteristics between 15 unmedicated adults with GTS without psychiatric co-morbidity and 15 healthy age- and sex-matched controls. We performed voxel-based morphometry (VBM) of regional fractional anisotropy (FA) values to identify regional differences in white matter microstructure between the groups. We also tested for a linear relationship between regional FA values and clinical scores of tic severity. Probabilistic fibre tracking was applied to characterize anatomical connectivity of those areas showing differences in regional FA. Compared with healthy controls, GTS patients showed bilateral FA increases in white matter underlying the post- and precentral gyrus, below the left supplementary motor area, and in the right ventro-postero-lateral part of the thalamus. The peak increase in FA was located below the left postcentral gyrus. Probabilistic tractography identified transcallosal and ipsilateral cerebello-thalamo-cortical pathways of the somatosensory system passing through this subcortical region. In patients, regional FA in this region showed an inverse linear relationship with tic severity. These findings demonstrate, for the first time, structural alterations in somatosensory pathways in GTS. Changes of water diffusion characteristics point towards reduced branching in somatosensory pathways in GTS patients. The negative correlation between higher regional FA values and fewer tics suggests that these alterations of white matter microstructure represent adaptive reorganization of somatosensory processing in GTS.",Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome; tics; diffusion tensor imaging; fractional anisotropy; somatosensory system; DEFICIT HYPERACTIVITY DISORDER; CORPUS-CALLOSUM MORPHOLOGY; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE IMAGES; SOMATIC SENSORY CORTEX; BASAL GANGLIA VOLUMES; WHITE-MATTER; DIFFUSION ANISOTROPY; RHESUS MONKEY; FRONTAL-LOBE; CHILDREN

While some forms of hearing deficits are peripheral in origin, others are centrally mediated. One such deficit is the ability to localize sounds, a critical component for segregating different acoustic objects and events, which is dependent on the auditory cortex. Recent evidence indicates that in aged animals the normal sharpening of spatial tuning between neurons in primary auditory cortex to the caudal lateral field does not occur as it does in younger animals. As a decrease in inhibition with aging is common in the ascending auditory system, it is possible that this lack of spatial tuning sharpening is due to a decrease in inhibition at different periods within the response. It is also possible that spatial tuning was decreased as a consequence of reduced inhibition at non-best locations. In this report we found that aged animals had greater activity throughout the response period, but primarily during the onset of the response. This was most prominent at non-best directions, which is consistent with the hypothesis that inhibition is a primary mechanism for sharpening spatial tuning curves. We also noted that in aged animals the latency of the response was much shorter than in younger animals, which is consistent with a decrease in pre-onset inhibition. These results can be interpreted in the context of a failure of the timing and efficiency of feed-forward thalamo-cortical and cortico-cortical circuits in aged animals. Such a mechanism, if generalized across cortical areas, could play a major role in age-related cognitive decline.",auditory cortex; spatial tuning; lateral belt; macaque; VISUAL CORTICAL-CELLS; RESPONSE PROPERTIES; INFERIOR COLLICULUS; SOUND LOCALIZATION; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; DEGRADATION; SENSITIVITY; INTENSITY; FREQUENCY; PATHWAYS

Here, we show that a pulvino-cortical circuit model, composed of the pulvinar and two cortical areas, captures several physiological and behavioral observations related to the macaque pulvinar. Effective connections between the two cortical areas are gated by the pulvinar, allowing the pulvinar to shift the operation regime of these areas during attentional processing and working memory and resolve conflict in decision making. Furthermore, cortico-pulvinar projections that engage the thalamic reticular nucleus enable the pulvinar to estimate decision confidence. Finally, feedforward and feedback pulvino-cortical pathways participate in frequency-dependent inter-areal interactions that modify the relative hierarchical positions of cortical areas. Overall, our model suggests that the pulvinar provides crucial contextual modulation to cortical computations associated with cognition.",nan; TOP-DOWN; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; MEDIAL PULVINAR; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SPATIAL ATTENTION; INFORMATION; DECISION; CIRCUIT; ORGANIZATION; CONFIDENCE

It uses established protocols to estimate the volume and number of neurons within the output nuclei (internal globus pallidus, IGP; and nondopaminergic substantia nigra, SNND), two internal relay and modulating nuclei (subthalamic nucleus, STh; and external globus pallidus, EGP), and a modulator of the striatum (dopaminergic substantia nigra, SND). Nuclear boundaries were defined by using immunohistochemistry for striatal afferents. Total numbers of Nissl-stained and parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons were calculated by using the fractionator technique. Comparisons between species were standardized relative to brain mass (rats < marmosets < macaques < baboons < humans). The EGP consistently had more neurons relative to the IGP, STh, and SND, which had similar neuronal numbers within each species. The SNND had proportionally more neurons in rats than in primates (especially humans). The distribution of SND neurons varied substantially between rats and primates (very few ventrally located neurons in rats) with humans containing fewer SND neurons than other primates. The reduction in SND neurons in humans suggests less dopaminergic regulation of the basal ganglia system compared with other species. The consistency in the number of IGP neurons across all species, combined with the reduction in SNND neurons in humans, suggests a greater emphasis on output pathways through the IGP and that there are proportionally more STh and EGP neurons in humans.

Previous observations on the effect of ablation or inactivation of the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) on the responses of neurons within the second somatosensory area(SII) to tactile stimuli point to profound differences between monkeys and certain other mammals in the organization of thalamocortical systems. In the cat, for example, tactile information appears to be conveyed in parallel from the thalamus to both SI and SII, whereas, in macaque and marmoset monkeys, it is conveyed in a serial (or hierarchical) scheme from the thalamus to SI and thence to SII. The present study examined the responses of individual SII neurons during reversible, cooling-induced inactivation of SI in another nonprimate placental mammal, the rabbit, to obtain further evidence on whether the above differences might reflect a fundamental distinction between simian primates and other mammalian species. 2. When the temperature at the face of a silver cooling block over the forepaw and hindpaw regions of SI was lowered to 5-13-degrees-C, the SI surface potentials evoked by brief tactile stimuli were abolished (indicative of SI inactivation), whereas SII potentials remained intact. 3. The responses of 25 SII neurons to controlled tactile stimuli (consisting of 1- to 1.5-s trains of vibration or rectangular mechanical pulses) were studied before, during, and after inactivation of SI. The effects on the spontaneous activity of a further three SII neurons that lacked identified receptive fields were also studied. 4. The response or activity levels of 26 of the 28 SII neurons examined (93%) were unaffected by SI inactivation. Furthermore, the temporal precision of responses at a particular phase of the repetitive mechanical stimuli also appeared to be unaffected by SI inactivation. The 28 neurons studied were located at different depths of the SII cortex and represented different functional classes, which included dynamically sensitive tactile neurons activated from glabrous or hairy skin by 5- to 10-Hz trains of mechanical stimuli and two neurons activated by high-frequency (300 Hz) cutaneous vibration, whose input appeared to come from pacinian corpuscles. 5. Only 2 of the 28 SII neurons exhibited a reduction in response to cutaneous stimuli during SI inactivation. However, because there was some evidence for a reduction in spontaneous activity in those neurons during SI inactivation, SI may exert a background facilitatory influence on the responsiveness of some SII neurons. 6. In conclusion, the results demonstrate that, in the rabbit, tactile information conveyed to SII is not dependent on an intracortical serially organized path through SI. Rather, the observations indicate that, in the rabbit, as in the cat, SI and SII are organized in parallel for the processing of information from the thalamus. These observations contrast with those in monkeys, where tactile processing is organized in a serial scheme, and support the hypothesis that there is a fundamental difference between simian primates and other mammals in the functional organization of thalamocortical tactile systems.",nan; BODY-SURFACE; CORTEX; ORGANIZATION; CAT; INFORMATION; PROJECTIONS; MACAQUES; LESIONS; STIMULI; INFANT

Two specific retinothalamic projections to area MT have been speculated to relay through the medial portion of the inferior pulvinar nucleus (PIm) and the koniocellular layers of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Although a number of studies have demonstrated retinal inputs to regions of the thalamus where relays to area MT have been observed, the relationship between the retinal terminals and area MT relay cells has not been established. Here we examined direct retino-recipient regions of the marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) pulvinar nucleus and the LGN following binocular injections of anterograde tracer, as well as area MT relay cells in these nuclei by injection of retrograde tracer into area MT. Retinal afferents were shown to synapse with area MT relay cells as demonstrated by colocalization with the presynaptic vesicle membrane protein synaptophysin. We also established the presence of direct synapes of retinal afferents on area MT relay cells within the PIm, as well as the koniocellular K1 and K3 layers of the LGN, thereby corroborating the existence of two disynaptic pathways from the retina to area MT that bypass V1.",nonhuman primate; thalamus; extrastriate areas; neuronal tracing; V1; synapse; synaptophysin; calcium-binding protein; MONKEY CALLITHRIX-JACCHUS; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; INFERIOR PULVINAR; MACAQUE MONKEY; CHOLERA-TOXIN; NEW-WORLD; KONIOCELLULAR PATHWAY; CORTICAL PROJECTIONS

[I-125]iodoMLA bound throughout the brain with the greatest density in the thalamus and moderate intensity in the basal ganglia and cortical regions. The Kd and Bmax in whole brain tissue were similar whether 1 mM nicotine (Kd 33.25 +/- 15.17 nM, Bmax 5.80 +/- 1.06 fmol/mg) or 2 mu M of the alpha 7-selective antagonist alpha-bungarotoxin (Kd 46.12 +/- 18.45 nM, Bmax 6.30 +/- 1.06 fmol/mg) was used for nonspecific binding. The subtype-selectivity of this ligand was further studied with competition binding studies using nicotine, alpha-bungarotoxin and noniodinated MLA. Each ligand completely inhibited [I-125]iodoMLA binding throughout the monkey brain, with Ki values of 2.23 +/- 0.85 mu M for nicotine, 2.72 +/- 1.71 nM for alpha-bungarotoxin and 1.83 +/- 0.35 nM MLA in the caudate and 2.03 +/- 1.14 mu M, 2.65 +/- 0.86 nM and 3.32 +/- 0.71 nM, respectively, in the putamen. The alpha 3 beta 2/alpha 6*-selective antagonist alpha-conotoxin MII failed to inhibit [I-125]iodoMLA binding in any brain region. In monkeys with cognitive deficits resulting from 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine administration, [I-125]iodoMLA binding was significantly increased in the striatum, similar to results previously observed for [I-125]alpha-bungarotoxin. These results suggest that, under the present experimental conditions, [I-125]iodoMLA was selective for alpha 7-containing nAChRs and did not bind to alpha 6-containing nAChRs.

Less is known about the long-term neurobiological impact of ELS. We used [F-18]-fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET) to assess neural responses to a moderate stress test in adult monkeys that experienced ELS as infants. Both groups of monkeys showed hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis stress-induced activations and cardiac arousal in response to the stressor. A whole brain analysis detected significantly greater regional cerebral glucose metabolism (rCGM) in superior temporal sulcus, putamen, thalamus, and inferotemporal cortex of ELS animals compared to controls. Region of interest (ROI) analyses performed in areas identified as vulnerable to ELS showed greater activity in the orbitofrontal cortex of ELS compared to control monkeys, but greater hippocampal activity in the control compared to ELS monkeys. Together, these results suggest hyperactivity in emotional and sensory processing regions of adult monkeys with ELS, and greater activity in stress-regulatory areas in the controls. Despite these neural responses, no group differences were detected in neuroendocrine, autonomic or behavioral responses, except for a trend towards increased stillness in the ELS monkeys. Together, these data suggest hypervigilance in the ELS monkeys in the absence of immediate danger. (c) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

In rhesus monkey, SARS-CoV-2 invades the CNS primarily via the olfactory bulb. Thereafter, viruses rapidly spread to functional areas of the central nervous system, such as hippocampus, thalamus, and medulla oblongata. The infection of SARS-CoV-2 induces the inflammation possibly by targeting neurons, microglia, and astrocytes in the CNS. Consistently, SARS-CoV-2 infects neuro-derived SK-N-SH, glial-derived U251, and brain microvascular endothelial cells in vitro.

A 5% decrease in caudate (Cd) nucleus volume is the most consistent structural finding in the brain of patients with Tourette syndrome (TS), but the cellular abnormalities that underlie this decrease in volume are unclear. In this study the density of different types of interneurons and medium spiny neurons (MSNs) in the striatum was assessed in the postmortem brains of 5 TS subjects as compared with normal controls (NC) by unbiased stereological analyses. TS patients demonstrated a 50%-60% decrease of both parvalbumin (PV)+ and choline acetyltransferase (ChAT)+ cholinergic interneurons in the Cd and the putamen (Pt). Cholinergic interneurons were decreased in TS patients in the associative and sensorimotor regions but not in the limbic regions of the striatum, such that the normal gradient in density of cholinergic cells (highest in associative regions, intermediate in sensorimotor and lowest in limbic regions) was abolished. No significant difference was present in the densities of medium-sized calretinin (CR)+ interneurons, MSNs, and total neurons. The selective deficit of PV+ and cholinergic striatal interneurons in TS subjects may result in an impaired cortico/thalamic control of striatal neuron firing in TS. J. Comp.

Early-enucleated fetuses (operated prior to embryonic day 77) showed morphological changes at the level of the thalamus and the cortex. In the thalamus, there was a loss of lamination and a decrease in size of the lateral geniculate nucleus. There was a decrease in the size of the inferior pulvinar, but there was no change in the lateral pulvinar. The border of striate cortex was as sharp in the enucleates as it was in the normal monkeys. In three of the four early enucleates, we observed an interdigitation of striate and extrastriate cortex. In three of the early enucleates, we observed a small island of nonstriate cortex near the striate border that was surrounded entirely by striate cortex. Enucleation led to an age-related reduction of striate cortex. This reduction was greater in the operculum than in the calcarine fissure. The reduction of striate cortex was accompanied by an increase in the dimensions of extrastriate visual cortex, so that the overall dimensions of the neocortex remained invariant. The extrastriate cortex in the enucleated animals presented a uniform cytoarchitecture and was indistinguishable from area 18 in the normal animal. There were changes in the gyral pattern that were restricted mainly to the cortex on the operculum. A deepening of minor dimples as well as the induction of a variable number of supplementary sulci led to an increase in the convolution of the occipital lobe. These results are discussed with respect to the specification of cortical areas. They demonstrate that the reduction in striate cortex was not accompanied by an equivalent reduction in the neocortex; rather, there was a border shift, and a large volume of cor tex that was destined to become striate cortex appears to be cytoarchitectonically normal extrastriate cortex.

The primary motor cortex (M1) deals with both aspects of movements to execute a single motor behavior. To elucidate how the cortical motor system is structured to process a variety of information, the laminar distribution patterns of signals were examined between SMA and M1, or PM and M1 in macaque monkeys by using dual anterograde tract-tracing. Dense terminal labeling was observed in layers 1 and upper 2/3 of M1 after one tracer injection into SMA, another tracer injection into the dorsal division of PM resulted in prominent labeling in the deeper portion of layer 2/3. Weaker labeling was also visible in layer 5 in both cases. On the other hand, inputs from M1 terminated in both the superficial and the deep layers of SMA and PM.

In one subgroup (E, type 1), axons have an elongated terminal field and thin, spinous terminations; in the other (R, type 2), axons have a small, round arbor and large, beaded terminations. Previous work (Rockland, 1996) indicates that E-type axons from several occipitotemporal areas branch extensively within and sometimes between pulvinar subdivisions, but that R-type axons tend to have spatially delimited arbors. The present report is a further investigation of R-type axons from areas VI and MT and was initiated to test the generality of the previous findings. There are four :main results: 1) By serial section reconstruction of anterogradely labeled axons, 10 of 25 axons originating in area V1 had two or three spatially separate arbors (8 and 2 axons, respectively). Sixteen axons analyzed from area MT, however, all had single arbors, although the arbors were often formed by the convergence of widely separate branches. 2) Multiple (at least 2-5) R-type corticopulvinar axons, from V1 or from MT, can converge in a single focus. 3) R-type axons originating from both areas V1 and MT can branch to other structures; namely, the superior colliculus, the pretectal area, and/or the reticular nucleus of the thalamus. 4) Finally, corticopulvinar terminations from area V1 are predominantly R-type, whereas those from MT are more predominantly E-type. These results thus provide additional evidence of the special relationship of area V1 to the pulvinar. They also emphasize that the idea of corticopulvinocortical feedback loops, although convenient as a shorthand nomenclature, does not adequately convey the full complexity of the system.

In addition, two modifications were identified that resulted in robust and reliable retrograde transport and EGFP expression after injection of the virus into three different brain regions in adult rats (medial prefrontal cortex, posterior thalamic nuclear group, and CA1). These are post-injection survival times of 14 days and addition of high concentrations of NaCl (>= 600 mM) to the injection buffer. These modifications resulted in obvious improvement in the intensity of the EGFP signal and in the number of labeled cells. Use of anti-EGFP in immunofluorescence or immunoperoxidase processing further enhanced the signal so that Golgi-like filling of dendritic spines and axon collaterals was routinely achieved. Effectiveness of the AdSynEGFP for Golgi-like filling was confirmed in one rhesus monkey with injections in visual area V4. Because of the long-term viability of the infected neurons (at least up to 28 days in rats and 22 days in monkey), this AdSynEGFP is suitable for use in microcircuitry studies in combination with other fluorescently tagged elements, including anterogradely labeled extrinsic projections. The native EGFP signal (without antibody enhancement) may be sufficient for studies involving cultured cells or slices.",cerebral cortex; dendritic spines; microcircuitry; NaCl; neuronal tracer; pyramidal neuron; IN-VIVO; AFFERENT CONNECTIONS; MACAQUE MONKEY; MODULAR ORGANIZATION; OVERLAP EXTENSION; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; VISUAL-CORTEX; GENE DELIVERY; VECTORS; EXPRESSION

Here, we used positron emission tomography (PET) and [F-18] deoxyglucose to compare the brain metabolic responses ( marker of brain function) of cocaine-addicted subjects (n = 21) and controls (n = 15) to identify brain regions that are uniquely activated in addicted subjects by intravenous methylphenidate ( a drug that cocaine-addicted subjects report to be similar to cocaine). In parallel, we also measured the changes in dopamine (DA) induced by intravenous methylphenidate (using PET and [C-11] raclopride) in the striatum and in the thalamus. Metabolic responses between groups differed significantly only in the right medial orbital prefrontal cortex [Brodmann's area (BA) 25 and medial BA 11], where methylphenidate increased metabolism in addicted subjects but decreased metabolism in controls. These changes were associated in all subjects with increased desire for methylphenidate and in the addicted subjects with cocaine craving. In addicted subjects, increases in BA 25 were also associated with mood elevation. Methylphenidate-induced increases in metabolism in the medial orbital prefrontal cortex were associated with its increase of DA in the thalamus but not in the striatum. These findings provide evidence that enhanced sensitivity of BA 25 (region involved with emotional reactivity) and BA 11 (region involved with salience attribution and motivation) in cocaine-addicted subjects may underlie the strong emotional response to the drug and the intense desire to procure it that results in craving and compulsive drug intake. It also suggests that the mesothalamic DA pathway may contribute to these processes.",thalamus; dopamine; motivation; orbitofrontal; cingulate gyrus; imaging; BRAIN GLUCOSE-METABOLISM; TRANSPORTER-IMMUNOREACTIVE AXONS; OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER; MOLECULAR-MECHANISMS; MEDIODORSAL THALAMUS; C-11 RACLOPRIDE; MACAQUE MONKEY; BLOOD-FLOW

Our results indicate that in the ferret, as in other species, MD projects heavily to the PFC although it also projects to other cortical and subcortical structures. The MD projection to PFC terminates largely in layer IV with lighter innervation of layers II, III, V, and VI. The cells projecting back to MD are mostly in layer VI. The parvocellular component of MD projects to and receives projections from the more caudal and dorsomedial component of the PFC, whereas the magnocellular portion of MD projects to and receives projections from the more rostral and lateral component of the PFC. With these results we have localized the ferret PFC, defined as a frontal cortical region with heavy reciprocal connections with the MD.",hodology; mediodorsal nucleus; thalamus; tracers; THALAMIC MEDIODORSAL NUCLEUS; CORTICAL PROJECTION AREA; MUSTELA-PUTORIUS; VISUAL-CORTEX; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; AFFERENT CONNECTIONS; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; FRONTAL-CORTEX

Although primates share many similarities in the organization of their visual centers with other mammals, and even other species of vertebrates, their visual pathways also show unique features, particularly with respect to the organization of the cerebral cortex. Therefore, in order to understand some aspects of human visual function, we need to study non-human primate brains. Which species is the most appropriate model? Macaque monkeys, the most widely used non-human primates, are not an optimal choice in many practical respects. For example, much of the macaque cerebral cortex is buried within sulci, and is therefore inaccessible to many imaging techniques, and the postnatal development and lifespan of macaques are prohibitively long for many studies of brain maturation, plasticity, and aging. In these and several other respects the marmoset, a small New World monkey, represents a more appropriate choice. Here we review the visual pathways of the marmoset, highlighting recent work that brings these advantages into focus, and identify where additional work needs to be done to link marmoset brain organization to that of macaques and humans. We will argue that the marmoset monkey provides a good subject for studies of a complex visual system, which will likely allow an important bridge linking experiments in animal models to humans.",vision; retina; thalamus; striate cortex; extrastriate cortex; Callitrichidae; NEW-WORLD MONKEY; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; MIDDLE TEMPORAL AREA; CYTOCHROME-OXIDASE STRIPES; CLASSICAL RECEPTIVE-FIELD; OCULAR DOMINANCE COLUMNS; RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; MIDGET-PARVOCELLULAR PATHWAY; CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEINS; CALLITHRIX-JACCHUS

A well established primate model of parkinsonism was used. Eight monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were rendered parkinsonian with 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Regular dosing with levodopa or apomorphine reliably resulted in peak dose dyskinesia. Thalamotomy was carried out using a radiofrequency electrode. To ensure that the appropriate area of the thalamus was targeted, that is the area receiving the pallidal input, an anatomical tracing study was carried out. The anterograde anatomical tracer horseradish peroxidase, covalently bound to wheatgerm agglutinin, was injected into the medical segment of the globus pallidus bilaterally in three monkeys. The target site for thalamotomy was accurately worked out from the tracings obtained. Chorea was usually abolished and always reduced by a thalamotomy in the pallidal terminal territory. This result was obtained after 10 thalamotomies: 4 animals receiving bilateral lesions, with an interval between operations, and 2 animals undergoing unilateral surgery. Lesions in three control sites were carried out and had no permanent effect on chorea. The effect of lesions in other areas was also assessed. Dystonia was not relieved by any thalamic lesion. Thalamotomy is a long established procedure used to help parkinsonian tremor. Appropriately placed thalamotomy should be considered for the relief of disabling peak dose dyskinesia, which is predominantly choreic, in parkinsonian patients on otherwise successful levodopa therapy.",PARKINSONISM; DYSKINESIA; LEVODOPA; THALAMOTOMY; PRIMATE MODEL; GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRIC ACID; MPTP-INDUCED PARKINSONISM; LATERAL THALAMIC REGION; GLOBUS PALLIDUS NEURONS; ON-OFF FLUCTUATIONS; BASAL GANGLIA; STEREOTACTIC THALAMOTOMY; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; STRIATAL STIMULATION; NEURAL MECHANISMS

To expand on this knowledge, we assessed the synaptic properties of excitatory projections from the primary to secondary auditory cortex and vice versa. We identified 2 types of postsynaptic responses. The first class of responses have larger initial excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), exhibit paired-pulse depression, are limited to ionotropic glutamate receptor activation, and have larger synaptic terminals; the second has smaller initial EPSPs, paired-pulse facilitation, metabotropic glutamate receptor activation, and smaller synaptic terminals. These responses are similar to the driver and modulator properties previously identified for thalamic and thalamocortical circuitry, suggesting that the same classification may extend to corticocortical inputs and have an implication for the functional organization of corticocortical circuits.",auditory cortex; cortical connectivity; corticocortical inputs; glutamate; laser uncaging of glutamate; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; MONKEY VISUAL-CORTEX; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL SULCUS; METABOTROPIC GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; EXPERIENCE-DEPENDENT PLASTICITY; MACAQUE MONKEY; RHESUS-MONKEY; CORTICOCORTICAL CONNECTIONS; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; DISTINGUISHING DRIVERS

We have previously shown that within the early weeks and months following one of these lesions, there is 1) a re-emergence of part or all of the cortical hand map; 2) central axonal sprouting of spared primary afferents into the dorsal horn and cuneate nucleus; and 3) substantial although incomplete recovery of hand function (Darian-Smith [2041 J. Comp. Neurol. 470:134-150; Darian-Smith and Ciferri [20051 J. Comp. Neurol. 491:27-45). In this study we asked: What neuronal reorganization occurs in the cuneate nucleus during this recovery period? And, does it contribute to the recovery of manual dexterity? To address these questions, the representation of the hand was electrophysiologically mapped (by unitary receptive field [RF] recordings) in the pars rotunda of the cuneate nucleus at either 1-2 weeks (short term) or 16-32 weeks (long term) post-rhizotomy. In short-term monkeys, the region deprived of input from the thumb, index, and middle finger was found to be unresponsive to cutaneous stimulation. However, at 16-32 weeks later, when dexterity had largely recovered, RFs of cuneate neurons could again be mapped within the cuneate nucleus, primarily in a region bordering the deprived zone. We conclude that the cuneate pre- and postsynaptic reorganization that occurs following dorsal rhizotomy plays a key role in the recovery of hand function.",adult plasticity; spinal injury; brainstem reorganization; dorsal root; somatosensory cortex; precision grip; BRAIN-STEM CONTRIBUTIONS; SPINAL-CORD; CORTICAL REORGANIZATION; AFFERENT-PROJECTIONS; ADULT CAT; PLASTICITY; DEAFFERENTATION; HAND; THALAMUS; CORTEX

Due to the putative importance of the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) in symptomatology, fibers that connect the OFC, SCT lesion, and either the thalamus or brainstem were investigated with two-tensor tractography using an unscented Kalman filter approach. From this dataset, fibers were warped to Montreal Neurological Institute space, and probability maps with center-of-mass analysis were subsequently generated. In comparing fibers from the same OFC region, including medial OFC (mOFC), central OFC (cOFC), and lateral OFC (lOFC), the area of divergence for fibers connected with the thalamus versus the brainstem is posterior to the anterior commissure. At the anterior commissure, fibers connected with the thalamus run dorsal to those connected with the brainstem. As OFC fibers travel through the ventral aspect of the internal capsule, lOFC fibers are dorsal to cOFC and mOFC fibers. Using neuroanatomical comparison, tracts coursing between the OFC and thalamus are likely part of the anterior thalamic radiations, while those between the OFC and brainstem likely belong to the medial forebrain bundle. These data support the involvement of the OFC in OCD and may be relevant to creating differential lesional procedures of specific tracts or to developing deep brain stimulation programming paradigms.",Psychosurgery; Diffusion tensor imaging; Diffusion tractography; Obsessive-compulsive disorder; Deep brain stimulation; OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER; DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; PREFRONTAL CORTICAL PROJECTIONS; GLUCOSE METABOLIC-RATE; CEREBRAL WHITE-MATTER; TERM-FOLLOW-UP; RHESUS-MONKEY; TOPOGRAPHIC PARCELLATION; SYMPTOM PROVOCATION; MACAQUE MONKEYS

A previous functional neuroimaging study failed to find clear effects of clonidine (alpha 2 adrenoceptor agonist) on activity of brain regions implicated in attention. Therefore, we now investigate whether clonidine affects the functional integration of a neuroanatomical attentional network, by modulating connectivity between brain regions rather than activity within discrete regions. Following infusion of either clonidine or placebo, positron emission tomography measurements of brain activity were collected in 13 normal subjects while they were either resting or performing an attentional task. Effective connectivity analysis showed that during rest, clonidine decreased the functional strength of connections both from frontal cortex to thalamus and in pathways to and from visual cortex. Conversely, during the attentional task, functional integration generally increased, with changes being centered on parietal cortex (increased connectivity from locus coeruleus to parietal cortex and from parietal cortex to thalamus and frontal cortex). A drug-induced increase in the modulatory effects of frontal cortex on projections from locus coeruleus to parietal cortex was also observed. Collectively, these results highlight cognitively dissociable effects of clonidine on interactions among functionally integrated brain regions and implicate the noradrenergic system in mediating the functional integration of attentional brain systems. The context-sensitive nature of the changes are consistent with observations that noradrenergic drugs have differential effects on brain processes depending on subjects' underlying arousal levels. More generally, the results illustrate the dynamic plasticity of cognitive brain systems following neurochemical challenge.

Multiple-injection PET experimental protocols with injections of radiolabeled and unlabeled doses of fallypride Were used to estimate the K-1, k(2), k(on)/V-R, k(off) and B-max' kinetic parameters. The experimental design was chosen using the D-optimal criterion to maximize the precision of the estimated binding parameters for the various brain regions. There was a significant range in B-max' for the putamen (27pmol/mL), caudate (23pmol/mL), ventral striatum (14pmol/mL), thalamus (1.8pmol/mL) and amygdala (0.9pmol/mL). Significant receptor binding was also found in the cortical regions. Knowledge of these in vivo rate constants serves as a necessary step in using [F-18]fallypride PET to measure D2/D3 receptor density and drug occupancy in clinical research applications. We believe the precise parameter estimates derived from these complicated experimental protocols are necessary for proper application of drug occupancy and clinical research studies with [F-18]fallypride, which often rely on the validity of assumptions regarding the model parameters.",multiple-injection PET; fallypride; D2 receptor; neuroreceptor model; DOPAMINE D2 RECEPTORS; KINETIC-ANALYSIS; DYNAMIC PET; HUMAN BRAIN; QUANTIFICATION; MODEL; INVIVO; IDENTIFICATION; QUANTITATION; RADIOLIGAND

Four human cadaver brains were cut into comparable and standardized sections parallel to the ACPC-plane, stained with DiI, and analyzed using a combination of confocal and polarized light microscopy at the same time. This combination provides information about the structure and orientation of the fibers in great detail with confocal microscopy, and information about the localization and orientation of long myelinated fiber tracts with polarization microscopy. The internal capsule was parcellated in the areas CI 1 to CI 4 containing fibers of distinct orientation and structure, which enriches the macroscopically definable parcellation in the anterior and posterior limb. Fibers of the anterior thalamic peduncle intermingle with frontopontine tract fibers. Single fibers connect the caudate and the lentiform nucleus. The pyramidal tract is located in the anterior half of the posterior limb intermingled with fibers of the superior thalamic peduncle. Parietooccipitopontine fibers are located in the posterior part of the posterior limb. The slopes of the different systems of fibers change continuously in the anterior-posterior direction of the internal capsule. Using the 3D orientation of fibers as a criterion for parcellation, as well as the description of bundles as a collection of fibers belonging to particular tracts leads to a more function-related description of the anatomy of the internal capsule. The method can be used for interindividual, sex- or age-related comparisons of particular systems of fibers. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V.

The mechanism is poorly understood. High-frequency STN DBS has been reported to affect motor cortex excitability in a complex way, but the timing between STN stimuli and changes in motor cortical (M1) excitability has not been investigated. We examined the time course of changes in motor cortical excitability following single pulse STN DBS. We studied 14 PD patients with implanted DBS electrodes in the STN, 2 patients with electrodes in internal globus pallidus (GPi), and 1 patient with an electrode in the sensory thalamus. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) was delivered to the M1 ipsilateral to the DBS with induced currents either in the anterior-posterior direction in the brain to evoke indirect ( I) waves or in the lateral-medial direction to activate corticospinal axons directly. Single pulse stimulation through the DBS contacts preceded the TMS by 0 - 10 ms. Surface EMG was recorded from the contralateral first dorsal interosseous muscle. Three milliseconds after STN stimulation, the motor evoked potential ( MEP) amplitudes produced by anterior-posterior current were significantly larger than control responses, while the responses to lateral-medial currents were unchanged. Similar facilitation also occurred after GPi stimulation, but not with thalamic stimulation. Single pulse STN stimulation facilitates the M1 at short latencies. The possible mechanisms include antidromic excitation of the cortico-STN fibers or transmission through the basal ganglia-thalamocortical pathway.",nan; DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; CORTICOSUBTHALAMIC INPUT ZONES; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; EFFERENT CONNECTIONS; EVOKED POTENTIALS; GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; MACAQUE MONKEY; ELECTRODES; REPRESENTATIONS

However, some stroke patients show the reverse pattern. Although their processing of visual and vestibular inputs for orientation perception of the Visual world is undisturbed, they push away actively from the ipsilesional side (the side of lesion location), leading to a contraversive tilt of the body (tilt toward the side opposite to the lesion) and falling to that side. Recently, the origin of contraversive pushing was identified as an altered perception of the body's orientation in relation to gravity. These patients experience their body as oriented upright when actually tilted enormously to the ipsilesional side (18 degrees on average). The findings argued for a separate pathway in humans for sensing body orientation in relation to gravity apart from the one projecting to the vestibular cortex. The present study aimed at identifying this brain area. The infarcted brain regions of 23 consecutively admitted patients with severe contraversive pushing were projected onto a template MRI scan, which had been normalized to Talairach space. The overlapping area of these infarctions centered on the posterolateral thalamus. Our finding necessitates reinterpretation of this area as being only a relay structure of the Vestibular pathway on its way from the brainstem to the vestibular cortex. The Ventral posterior and lateral posterior nuclei of the posterolateral thalamus (and probably its cortical projections) rather seem to be fundamentally involved in the neural representation of a second graviceptive system in humans decisive for our control of upright body posture.",pusher syndrome; thalamus; gravity; vestibular; spatial neglect; MONKEYS MACACA-FASCICULARIS; VESTIBULAR CORTEX; RESPONSES; NEURONS

The early genesis of the central monoaminergic neurons in mammals has led to postulations of a trophic role of monoamines in brain morphogenesis-especially in the cerebral cortex. The developmental effects of amines can be linked to the transient expression of different molecules linked to dopamine or serotonin neurotransmission. We present novel data on the immunocytochemistry of the vesicular monoamine transporter (VMAT2) and of the high-affinity serotonin transporter (SERT) in human fetuses. SERT is a marker of the serotoninergic axons and allows visualization of the serotonin afferents of the raphe in the human telencephalon. In addition, during a restricted time period corresponding to 12-14 postovulatory weeks, we found SERT-immunolabeled fibers in the rostral and caudal limbs of the internal capsule that do not correspond to serotoninergic fibers, but do coincide with the calbindin D28k-labeled thalamocortical fiber tracts. The present observations are correlated with findings in rodents, in which a transient expression of SERT is visible in the thalamocortical axons during early postnatal life. The function of this transporter has been shown to be important for the fine-tuning of cortical sensory maps during the critical period of development of these maps. Although the present observation does not allow ascertainment of which neurons transiently express SERT, it lends support to the notion that serotonin and serotonin uptake could have important developmental roles, during the formation of brain connections in humans, as they have in rodents.",human development; dopamine; transient; internal capsule; thalamus; tyrosine hydroxylase; catecholamines; serotonin transporter; HYDROXYLASE-IMMUNOREACTIVE NEURONS; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; KNOCK-OUT MICE; TYROSINE-HYDROXYLASE; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; HUMAN EMBRYOS; TRANSIENT EXPRESSION; RHESUS-MONKEY; HUMAN BRAIN; NORADRENERGIC INNERVATIONS

This study examines how the connections of layer VI neurons are arranged with respect to the functionally distinct classes of neurons that compose their cortical and subcortical targets. By placing injections of biocytin into layer VI of tree shrew striate cortex, we identified two sublayers that differ in their intracortical and thalamic connections. Neurons in the upper part of layer VI, layer VIa, terminate in cortical layer IV, whereas those in the lower part of layer VI, layer VIb, terminate throughout the supragranular layers, layers I-III. The selectivity of layer VI subdivisions for the granular and supragranular layers is also evident in their descending projections. Neurons in layer Via terminate preferentially in the LGN layers that supply layer IV (LGN layers 1, 2, 4, and 5), whereas neurons in layer VIb terminate in the LGN layers that supply layers I-III (LGN layers 3 and 6) and in the pulvinar nucleus. Additional subclasses of layer VIa neurons were identified based on the restriction of their terminal fields to narrow subtiers within layer IV. By influencing the activity of distinct populations of cortical neurons and the thalamic neurons that supply them, layer VI neurons could exert a powerful influence on the flow of activity in functionally distinct cortical circuits.","visual cortex; area 17; lateral geniculate nucleus; pulvinar; corticothalamic pathways; ON, OFF pathways; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; LAMINAR ORGANIZATION; TUPAIA-GLIS; MACAQUE MONKEY; X-CELL; Y-CELL; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; INTRINSIC CONNECTIONS; RETROGRADE TRANSPORT"

However, the contribution of subcortical structures remains unknown. The basal ganglia provide serial tonic inhibitory connections between the DLPFC and the SC, and could therefore be involved in preventing the triggering of unnecessary saccades. The DLPFC could also exert its inhibitory effect on the SC through direct prefronto-tectal pathways that travel in the internal capsule (IC). Since thalamic dysfunction may be responsible for reduced DLPFC activation, it may be hypothesized that the thalamus could also participate in saccadic inhibition. Methods: The authors recorded reflexive saccade triggering (prosaccade task) and inhibition (antisaccade task) in 29 patients with a single lesion affecting the striatum, the thalamus, or the IC, and compared these results to control subjects. Results: A normal error rate in the antisaccade task was found in patients with 1) a basal ganglia lesion, 2) a thalamic lesion, or 3) a lesion restricted to the posterior half of the posterior limb of the IC. An increased error rate in the antisaccade task was found in patients with a lesion affecting the anterior limb, the genu, or the anterior half of the posterior limb of the IC. Conclusion: These results suggest that neither the basal ganglia nor the thalamus plays a major role in reflexive saccade suppression, but support the hypothesis of a direct DLPFC inhibitory control of saccade triggering on the SC.",nan; SACCADIC EYE-MOVEMENTS; NIGRA PARS RETICULATA; PROGRESSIVE SUPRANUCLEAR PALSY; MONKEY SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; HUNTINGTONS-DISEASE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; BASAL-GANGLIA; FUNCTIONAL NEUROANATOMY

Recently studies based on functional MRI have suggested putative human homologue of some of the areas of the macaque superior parietal lobule. Here we review the anatomical subdivision, the cortico-cortical and thalamocortical connections of the macaque superior parietal lobule compared with their functional properties and the homology with human organization in physiological and lesioned situations. The knowledge of this part of the macaque brain could help in understanding pathological conditions that in humans affect the normal behaviour of arm-reaching actions and can inspire brain computer interfaces performing in more accurate ways the sensorimotor transformations needed to interact with the surrounding environment.",Sensory information; Multisensory; Memory; Attention; Cerebral cortex; Neural networks; Connectivity; nan

A second visual pathway has been postulated to pass through the thalamic pulvinar nucleus and to project to multiple regions of visual cortex. We have explored this second visual pathway using a method that allows us to identify the inputs and outputs of pulvinar neurons. Specifically, we applied microstimulation in the superficial layers of superior colliculus (SC) to test for orthodromic activation of pulvinar neurons receiving input from SC. We also microstimulated the cortical motion area MT and tested for antidromic activation of pulvinar to identify neurons projecting to MT (and to determine the presence of orthodromic input back to pulvinar). In this initial report, we concentrate on two observations. First, we find that there are clusters of neurons in the pulvinar that receive input from SC along with neurons that project to MT or receive input from MT. Second, we find that neurons with input from SC have characteristics of the SC superficial layers: they respond to visual stimuli but do not discharge before saccadic eye movements. Neurons projecting to MT respond similarly to these SC-input neurons, while those receiving input from MT more frequently show directional selectivity as does MT. These findings indicate the visual nature of the signals conveyed in this pathway and shed light on the functional role of the thalamus in a possible second visual pathway.",pulvinar; superior colliculus; MT; two visual pathways; monkey visual pathways; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; INFERIOR PULVINAR; MACAQUE MONKEY; RHESUS-MONKEY; AREA-MT; PROJECTIONS; ORGANIZATION

Reconstructions of labeled terminals and their beaded varicosities in the neostriatum and thalamus were analyzed quantitatively to compare the extent of overlapping projections to both subcortical structures. Corticostriatal projections from focal sites in both somatosensory areas exhibited substantial amounts of divergence within the dorsolateral neostriatum. Most of the labeled terminals were concentrated in densely packed arborizations that occupied lamellar-shaped regions along the dorsolateral edge of the neostriatum. Tracer injections in both cortical areas also produced dense anterograde and retrograde labeling in the thalamus, especially in the ventrobasal complex (VB) and in the medial part of the posterior (POm) nucleus. Because these thalamic regions are topographically organized and have reciprocal connections with corresponding representations in both SI and SII, the amount of labeled overlap in the thalamus was used to indicate the degree of somatotopic correspondence at the SI and SII injection sites. We found that the proportion of overlapping projections to the neostriatum was moderately correlated with the amount of overlap observed in the thalamus. This result strongly indicates that specific sites in the dorsolateral neostriatum receive convergent projections from corresponding somatotopic representations in SI and SII, but also suggests that some of the corticostriatal divergence may reflect neostriatal integration of somatosensory information from noncorresponding representations in SI and SII.

Neuronal cell tropisms and infection patterns are viable options for obtaining viral vector-mediated transgene delivery that is selective for particular neuronal pathways. For example, several types of viral vectors can infect axon terminals (retrograde infections), which enables targeted transgene delivery to neurons that directly project to a particular viral injection region. Although recent studies in rodents have demonstrated that adeno-associated virus serotype 8 (AAV8) and 9 (AAV9) efficiently transduce neurons, the tropisms and infection patterns remain poorly understood in primate brains. Here, we constructed recombinant AAV8 or AAV9, which expressed an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) gene driven by a ubiquitous promoter (AAV8-EGFP and AAV9-EGFP, respectively), and stereotaxically injected it into several brain regions in marmosets and macaque monkeys. Immunohistochemical analyses revealed almost exclusive colocalization of EGFP fluorescence via AAV9-mediated gene transfer with a neuron-specific marker, indicating endogenous neuronal tropism of AAV9, which was consistent with our previous results utilizing AAV8. Injections of either AAV8-EGFP or AAV9-EGFP into the marmoset striatum resulted in EGFP expression in local striatal neurons as a result of local infection, as well as expression in dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra via retrograde transport along nigrostriatal axonal projections. Retrograde infections were also observed in the frontal cortex and thalamus, which are known to have direct projections to the striatum. These local and retrograde gene transfers were further demonstrated in the geniculocortical pathway of the marmoset visual system. These findings indicate promising capabilities of AAV8 and AAV9 to deliver molecular tools into a range of primate neural systems in pathway-specific manners through their neuronal tropisms and infection patterns.

Less understood are the fidelity of entrainment to each stimulus pulse, whether entrainment patterns are stationary over time, and how responses differ among DBS targets. In this study, three rhesus macaques were implanted with a single DBS lead in VPLo, STN, or GP. Single-unit spike activity was recorded in the resting state in motor cortex during VPLo DBS, in GP during STN DBS, and in STN and pallidal-receiving area of motor thalamus (VLo) during GP DBS. VPLo DBS induced time-locked spike activity in 25% (n = 15/61) of motor cortex cells, with entrained cells following 7.5 +/- 7.4% of delivered pulses. STN DBS entrained spike activity in 26% (n = 8/27) of GP cells, which yielded time-locked spike activity for 8.7 +/- 8.4% of stimulus pulses. GP DBS entrained 67% (n = 14/21) of STN cells and 32% (n = 19/59) of VLo cells, which showed a higher fraction of pulses effectively inhibiting spike activity (82.0 +/- 9.6% and 86.1 +/- 16.6%, respectively). Latency of phase-locked spike activity increased over time in motor cortex (58%, VPLo DBS) and to a lesser extent in GP (25%, STN DBS). In contrast, the initial inhibitory phase observed in VLo and STN during GP DBS remained stable following stimulation onset. Together, these data suggest that circuit-level entrainment is low-pass filtered during high-frequency stimulation, most notably for glutamatergic pathways. Moreover, phase entrainment is not stationary or consistent at the circuit level for all DBS targets.",deep brain stimulation; mechanisms; entrainment; peri-stimulus time histogram; subthalamic nucleus; globus pallidus; thalamus; motor cortex; DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; SYNAPTIC DEPRESSION; NEURONS; MECHANISMS; ACTIVATION; CONDUCTION; RESPONSES; BLOCK

With each of these markers, the inferior pulvinar complex can be subdivided into four distinct regions. Calbindin-D28k immunoreactivity is densely distributed in cells and neuropil within PI, except for a distinct centromedially located gap. This calbindin-poor zone, termed the medial division of the inferior pulvinar (PI(M)), corresponds precisely to a region that contains elevated cytochrome oxidase activity and parvalbumin immunostaining. The PI(M) extends slightly above and behind the classically defined limit of the inferior pulvinar, the corticotectal tract. Regions of inferior pulvinar with intense immunostaining for calbindin-D28k were the posterior division of the inferior pulvinar (PI(P), medial to PI(M)) and the central division (PI(C), lateral to PI(M)). A newly recognized lateral region, PI(L), adjoins the lateral geniculate nucleus and stains more lightly for calbindin and parvalbumin immunoreactivity and for cytochrome oxidase. Staining patterns for calbindin, parvalbumin, and cytochrome oxidase in the pulvinar of rhesus monkeys closely resemble those shown in squirrel monkey inferior pulvinar, suggesting that a common organization exists in all primates. In order to examine cortical connection patterns of the histochemically defined compartments in the inferior pulvinar, injections of up to five neuroanatomical tracers (wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase and fluorescent retrograde tracers) were placed in the same cerebral hemisphere. Single injection sites were in the middle temporal area (MT), and several separate injections were placed in a strip corresponding to the rostral subdivision of the dorsolateral area (DLr). Injections that involved only DLr and not MT labeled principally the PI(C), and more sparsely PI(P) and PI(L). DLr connections occupied a ''shell'' region dorsal to PI(M) that extended from PI(C) into the lateral and medial divisions of the pulvinar, PL and PM. Injection sites that included MT or were largely restricted to MT produced dense label in PI(M) and moderate label in PI(C) and PI(L). The retinotopic organization within the inferior pulvinar was inferred from patterns of connections. Connections with cortex related most closely to central vision were found posteriorly in PI(M) and in adjacent portions of PI(C) as it wraps around the caudal pole of PI(M). Cortex related to more peripheral locations in the lower visual field connected with more rostral PI(M) and PI(C). Patterns of label within the portions of PL and PM that were immediately adjacent to PI(M) roughly paralleled those in PI(M) and PI(C). Thus, a distinct chemoarchitectonic subdivision of the inferior pulvinar, PI(M), is the major source of thalamic projections to MT in squirrel monkeys. Interestingly, the relative scarcity of calbindin immunostaining in PI(M) is characteristic of ''primary'' thalamic relay nuclei, such as the ventroposterior and lateral geniculate nuclei. Thus, the PI(M)-MT pathway may share certain physiological characteristics with primary sensory relays, such as those involving intracellular calcium buffering and, perhaps, rapid and secure impulse transmission.

Nine healthy subjects were recruited to the study and underwent scanning on a 3T magnet. We were able to define well-known image-forming (optic nerve -> lateral geniculate -> visual cortex) as well as a less known nonimage forming visual pathway from the optic chiasm to the pulvinar, and from the pulvinar to several associative cortical brain regions. Such pathway may allow photic signals to converge on a thalamic region we described recently to be selectively activated during migraine headache.

Injections were made into the anteroventral thalamic nucleus, the medial mammillary nucleus, the nucleus accumbens, and the lateral septal nucleus. To facilitate the analysis, the hippocampal formation with adjacent cortices were flattened, which allowed the cutting of sections perpendicular to the full septotemporal axis. Cells projecting to the anteroventral thalamic nucleus (AV cells), the medial mammillary body (MMB cells), and the nucleus accumbens (ACC cells) were observed consistently throughout the entire septotemporal (dorsoventral) and transverse extent of the subiculum (from field CA1 of the hippocampus to the presubiculum). In the transverse plane, the three kinds of projection cells were arranged in a laminar fashion: The AV cells were observed in the deepest portion of the subicular pyramidal cell layer, the ACC cells were observed in the most superficial portion of the layer, and the MMB cells were observed in the middle portion of the layer. Although this laminar arrangement was observed at all septotemporal levels of the subiculum, it was most apparent at the septal level. At more temporal levels, the laminae shifted such that the superficially located ACC cells were more prominent in the proximal half of the subiculum, whereas the AV cells were shifted toward the distal half of the subiculum. The average size of somata of the AV cells was 72.3 mum(2), that of the ACC cells was 105.2 mum(2), and that of the MMB cells was 121.8 mum(2) The connectional and cytoarchitectonic data indicate that there is a distinct sublamination of the subicular pyramidal cell layer, suggesting that the subiculum may be analogous to the infragranular layer (layers V and VI) of the isocortex.

The most direct pathway identified to the extrastriate cortex is a disynaptic one that provides robust magno- and parvocellular inputs to the middle temporal area (MT). The inclusion of parvocells in this projection is somewhat surprising because of their importance for color and form vision, whereas MT is more strictly tuned to velocity. This raises the question of whether areas more involved in color and form processing, such as V4, receive similar projections. We report here on experiments that use rabies virus injections into V4 to retrogradely label mono- and disynaptic inputs. We find only a small number of labeled neurons in the LGN in a pattern consistent with monosynaptic labeling of koniocells, rather than disynaptic labeling of magno- and parvocells. The lack of robust magno- and parvocellular label was not due to ineffective viral transport because in the same cases we find hundreds of neurons labeled in the thalamic reticular nucleus, a structure that can only be labeled disynaptically from the cortex. We also find a complete absence of neurons labeled in V1, but thousands in adjacent areas V2 and V3. This result helps explain the absence of labeled magno- and parvocells in the LGN because disynaptic transport from an extrastriate visual area should require a relay through V1. Taken together, these results suggest that ascending magno/parvocellular inputs to V4 are more hierarchically organized than the relatively direct inputs to MT. J. Comp. Neurol. 520:25002511, 2012.

This study compared regional brain serotonin transporter (SERT) binding between nine PR and seven mother-reared rhesus monkeys with [C-11] DASB positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. Parametric images of binding potential (BP) (which is proportional to B-max/K-D, in which B-max is transporter density and K-D is dissociation constant) and relative blood flow (R-1) were generated by the two-parameter multilinear reference tissue model. R1 images were used for coregistration and normalization of PET parametric data to the magnetic resonance imaging template space. Group BP differences were analyzed voxelwise by Student's t test in SPM2. Region of interest-based parameter values were also calculated to obtain the magnitude of regional BP differences between the two groups. For the PR group, SERT BP was decreased by 10 - 23% across a range of brain areas consisting of the raphe, thalamus, hypothalamus, caudate and putamen, globus pallidum, anterior cingulate gyrus, and medial temporal regions, including amygdala and hippocampus (cluster-level corrected p = 0.002). For the latter three regions, BP was decreased in the right hemisphere. These results agree with the hypothesis that early maternal deprivation affects the development of the serotonergic system and suggest that decreased serotonergic innervations in the critical brain regions may explain some of the behavioral and biochemical abnormalities in PR monkeys.",positron emission tomography; serotonin transporter; early life stress; aggression; peer-reared rhesus monkey; impulse control; NONHUMAN PRIMATE MODEL; 5-HYDROXYINDOLEACETIC ACID CONCENTRATIONS; STRIATAL DOPAMINE TRANSPORTER; EXCESSIVE ALCOHOL-CONSUMPTION; DIMINISHED SOCIAL COMPETENCE; H-3 PAROXETINE BINDING; CEREBROSPINAL-FLUID; HEALTHY HUMANS; IN-VITRO; BRAIN

We examined the effects of attention on the receptive fields of simple cells in primary visual cortex ( V1) by training macaque monkeys to perform a task with two modes. In the attended mode, the stimuli relevant to the animal's task overlay the receptive field of the neuron being recorded. In the unattended mode, the animal was cued to attend to stimuli outside the receptive field of that neuron. The relevant stimulus, a colored pixel, was briefly presented within a white-noise stimulus, a flickering grid of black and white pixels. The receptive fields of the neurons were mapped by correlating spikes with the white-noise stimulus in both attended and unattended modes. We found that attention could cause significant modulation of the visually evoked response despite an absence of significant effects on the overall firing rates. On further examination of the relationship between the strength of the visual stimulation and the firing rate, we found that attention appears to cause multiplicative scaling of the visually evoked responses of simple cells, demonstrating that attention reaches back to the initial stages of visual cortical processing.",attention; striate; vision; cortex; macaque; mapping; receptive field; SUSTAINED INATTENTIONAL BLINDNESS; CORTICAL AREAS V1; STRIATE CORTEX; SPATIAL ATTENTION; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE; MAGNIFICATION FACTOR; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; MACAQUE MONKEY; THALAMIC INPUT

Angiotensin IV binding sites (also known as the AT(4) receptors) are widely distributed in guinea pig and monkey (Macaca fascicularis) brains where high densities of the binding sites have been detected in the hippocampus. neocortex and motor nuclei. However, the distribution of the binding sites in the human brain is not known. We have recently localised the angiotensin IV binding sites (AT(4) receptors) in post-mortem human brain using iodinated Nle-angiotensin IV, a higher affinity and more stable analogue of angiotensin IV. This radioligand bound with relatively high affinity and specificity to angiotensin IV binding sites. In competition studies on consecutive sections through the prefrontal cortex and claustrum, angiotensin IV. Nle-angiotensin IV and LVV-hemorphin 7 competed for the binding of I-125[Nle]-angiotensin IV with nanomolar affinities. Angiotensin II and the AT(4) and AT(4) receptor antagonists were ineffective in competing for the binding at concentrations of up to 10 muM. We found high densities of I-125[Nle]-angiotensin IV binding sites throughout the cerebral cortex including the insular, entorhinal, prefrontal and cingulate cortices. Very high densities of the binding sites were observed in the claustrum, choroid plexus, hippocampus and pontine nucleus. Some thalamic nuclei displayed high densities of binding including the anteroprincipal, ventroanterior, anteromedial, medial dorsal acid ventrolateral nuclei. The caudate nucleus, putamen, many amygdaloid nuclei and the red nucleus all displayed moderate densities of binding with a higher level detected in the substantia nigra pars compacta. In the hypothalamus, high densities binding sites were found in the ventromedial nucleus with lower levels in the dorsomedial and paraventricular nuclei. The distribution of I-125[Nle]-angiotensin IV binding sites in the human brain is similar to that found in other species and supports multiple roles for the binding sites in the central nervous system, including facilitation of memory retention and retrieval.

Forty individual axons were analyzed by serial section reconstruction and divided into two major groups. The majority of axons have numerous (typically 500-1,000) small, spinous endings (boutons terminaux). These axons have terminal fields that are beam-like or elongated (E, corresponding to classical type 1) and highly divergent (1.0-3.0 mm). These frequently innervate several of the traditionally designated pulvinar subdivisions; namely inferior pulvinar (PI) and the ventral part of interal pulvinar (PL); medial pulvinar (PM) and dorsal FL, and (one axon) PM, dorsal FL, and PI. Some axons, however (R or round, corresponding to classical type 2), have a small number (typically 70-160) of primarily large, beaded endings (boutons en passant), which concentrate in sharply delimited, round arbors (diameters 100-125 mu m). R axons appear to be larger caliber than E axons (1.0-1.5 mu m vs. 0.5-1.0 mu m, respectively). These differences in phenotype are probably associated with distinct types of projection neurons. In visual areas, corticopulvinar terminations are reported to originate from pyramidal cell subpopulations in layer 5. Indirect evidence, presented here, suggests that the more numerous medium-sized neurons give rise to E axons, and the sparser giant pyramids give rise to R corticopulvinar axons. If this is correct, corticopulvinar connectivity may be involved in multiple transformations. Spatially, axons of giant neurons (with basal dendrites that collect intracortically from a disc-like area, about 1.0 mm in diameter) converge onto a small number of pulvinar neurons. Axons of medium neurons (with basal dendrites that occupy a small intracortical disc, about 0.3 mm in diameter) diverge over 1.0-3.0 mm in the pulvinar and may form many contacts. Giant neurons, although numerically few in relation to medium pyramids (1 or 2: 50?), are likely to have distinctive membrane properties (functionally equivalent to bursting neurons?). Their larger boutons and axon caliber may be associated with a faster transmission that compensates for their small numbers. In primates, the E and R duality does not characterize cortical projections to the caudate, lateral geniculate nucleus, pens, or superior colliculus and thus may be essentially linked to pulvinar-specific processes.

Its extent depends on the age of the monkey at operation, post-operative survival, species and retinal eccentricity. Some studies of human patients with occipital lobe injury have found no evidence transneuronal retrograde degeneration, suggesting that either degeneration may not occur or, if present, it is caused directly by secondary damage impinging upon the underlying white matter or the blood supply to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus and optic tract. We therefore studied retinal ganglion cell degeneration in three macaques in which only the striate cortex corresponding: to the macular retina had been removed, thereby sparing extrastriate colter and precluding interruption of the vascular supply to the thalamus and optic tract. There was extensive loss of ganglion cells in the central retina, corresponding to the central 10 degrees of vision. As the cortical lesion was too small to affect the thalamus or optic tract directly, the retinal degeneration must he transneuronal. Quantitative analysis showed a 65-80% loss of ganglion cells in the corresponding perifoveal retinae along the horizontal meridian. The results: confirm that the loss of retinal gan linn cells following striate cortical lesions is predominantly transneuronal.",retina; ganglion cells; striate cortex; transneuronal degeneration; dLGN; monkey; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; MACAQUE MONKEYS; VISUAL-FIELD; OPTIC TRACT; REMOVAL; REPRESENTATION; TOPOGRAPHY; ATROPHY; SIZE

On the basis of their verbal fluency scores, two subgroups of the ALS patients (five high, five low scores) and a different group of five age-matched controls then underwent positron emission tomographic (PET) measurement of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF). Scans were performed in the resting state and while subjects performed stereotyped or freely selected movements of a joystick with their right hand. The pattern of cerebral activation associated with self-generated activity was determined by comparing the profile of rCBF during freely selected and stereotyped joystick movements. Statistical parametric mapping was used to determine significant differences in rCBF between the groups at rest and during activation. Regional cerebral blood now at rest was significantly (P < 0.01) reduced in the anterior cingulate cortex of both ALS subgroups in comparison with controls. The profile of cortical and subcortical activation during performance of freely selected joystick movements relative to stereotyped movements was abnormal in ALS patients: (i) ALS patients with a normal fluency score showed significantly (P < 0.01) attenuated rCBF responses in comparison with controls in the left medial prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 10) and the right and left parahippocampal gyri; (ii) ALS patients with impaired verbal fluency showed significantly (P < 0.01) attenuated rCBF responses in comparison with controls in the right and left medial prefrontal cortex (areas 9 and 10), the rostral aspects of the right anterior cingulate cortex (areas 24 and 32), the right parahippocampal gyrus and the anterior thalamic nuclear complex; (iii) ALS patients with impaired verbal fluency showed significantly (P < 0.01) attenuated rCBF responses in comparison with patients with normal verbal fluency in the right parahippocampal gyrus, the anterior thalamic nuclear complex and the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (area 24). Regional cerebral blood flow at rest in the right parahippocampal gyrus of ALS patients was significantly correlated with verbal fluency score (P = 0.01) and picture recall score (P = 0.01). Activation of the anterior thalamic nuclear complex in ALS patients was also significantly correlated with verbal fluency score (P = 0.001) and picture recall score (P = 0.01). The results show that abnormalities of function are present in regions along a limbo-thalamo-cortical pathway in some ALS patients during performance of a self-generated motor task. Those ALS patients with impaired verbal fluency show more significantly impaired function in these regions than ALS patients with normal verbal fluency. The findings support the view that dysfunction of cortical neurons in ALS extends beyond those contributing to the corticospinal tract.",nan; MOTOR NEURON DISEASE; RHESUS-MONKEY; PET IMAGES; PRESENILE-DEMENTIA; CINGULATE CORTEX; HIPPOCAMPAL; IMPAIRMENT; LESIONS; BRAIN; INCLUSIONS

The results revealed that the pattern of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase immunoreactivity varied systematically throughout the rhesus monkey hypothalamus. Extremely high densities of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase-immunoreactive processes were observed in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei, while relatively lower levels were found in the arcuate and dorsomedial nuclei and in the medial preoptic, perifornical, and suprachiasmatic areas. Moderate levels of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase immunoreactivity were found throughout the lateral hypothalamic area and in the internal lamina of the median eminence. Very few immunoreactive processes were found in the ventromedial nucleus or in the mammillary complex. Other midline diencephalic structures were found to have high densities of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase immunoreactivity, including the paraventricular nucleus of the thalamus and a discrete subregion of nucleus reuniens, the magnocellular subfascicular nucleus. A moderate density of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase immunoreactive processes were found in the rhomboid nucleus and zona incerta whereas little dopamine-beta-hydroxylase immunoreactivity was found in the fields of Forel, nucleus reuniens, or subthalamic nucleus. The differential distribution of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase-immunoreactive processes may reflect a potential role of norepinephrine as a regulator of a variety of functions associated with the nuclei that are most heavily innervated, e.g., neuroendocrine release from the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei, and gonadotropin release from the medial preoptic area and mediobasal hypothalamus. Additionally, quantitative analysis of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase-immunoreactive varicosities was performed on a laser scanning microscope in both magnocellular and parvicellular regions of the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus. The methodology employed in this study allowed for the high resolution of immunoreactive profiles through the volume of tissue being analyzed, and was more accurate than conventional light microscopy in terms of varicosity quantification. Quantitatively, a significant difference in the density of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase-immunoreactive varicosities was found between magnocellular and parvicellular regions, suggesting that parvicellular neurons received a denser noradrenergic input. These differential patterns may reflect an important functional role for norepinephrine in the regulation of anterior pituitary secretion through the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal stress axis.",IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY; LASER SCANNING MICROSCOPY; NOREPINEPHRINE; PRIMATE; QUANTITATIVE NEUROANATOMY; SCANNING LASER MICROSCOPE; SIMULTANEOUS MONOAMINE HISTOFLUORESCENCE; DOUBLE-LABELING IMMUNOCYTOCHEMISTRY; VASOPRESSIN-CONTAINING NEURONS; SUPRAOPTIC NUCLEI; ULTRASTRUCTURAL DEMONSTRATION; NEUROPEPTIDE IMMUNOCYTOCHEMISTRY; CYTOARCHITECTONIC SUBDIVISIONS; CATECHOLAMINERGIC INNERVATION; MAGNOCELLULAR NEURONS

On this basis, the tritiated compound was examined for its utility in autoradiography to localize the 5-HT1F receptor in rat and guinea pig brain regions. Specific 5-HT1F receptor binding in rat brain was found in layers 4 - 5 of all cortical regions examined, as well as olfactory bulb and tubercle, nucleus accumbens, caudate putamen, parafascicular nucleus of the thalamus, medial mammillary nucleus, the CA3 region of the hippocampus, subiculum, and several amygdaloid nuclei. In guinea pig brain, the [H-3] LY334370 binding sites were found at highest density in claustrum, but also in a layer of the cortex, caudate putamen, nucleus accumbens, thalamus, and medial mammillary nucleus. Some species differences in the distribution of the 5-HT1F receptor were noted. Side by side comparison of rat brain autoradiography with [H-3] LY334370 and [H-3] sumatriptan showed labeling in the same brain regions. Preliminary binding studies in rhesus monkey and human brain sections showed [H-3] LY334370 binding in cortical layers 4-5, subiculum ( in the monkey), and the granule cell layer of the cerebellum. These findings suggest a discrete localization of the 5-HT1F receptor in the rat, guinea pig, monkey and human brain, and confirms the utility of [H-3] LY334370 as a potential tool to explore further the localization and possible functions of the 5-HT1F receptor.",autoradiography; LY334370; 5-HT1F receptor; SUMATRIPTAN-BINDING-SITES

Strong local projections from the NOT were demonstrated to the superior colliculus and the dorsal terminal nucleus bilaterally and to the contralateral NOT. The contralateral oculomotor complex, including motoneurons (C-group) and subdivisions of the Edinger-Westphal complex, also received inputs. NOT efferents terminated in all accessory optic nuclei (AON) ipsilaterally; contralateral AON projections arose from the pretectal olivary nucleus embedded in the NOT. Descending pathways contacted precerebellar nuclei: the dorsolateral and dorsomedial pontine nuclei, the nucleus reticularis tegmenti pontis, and the inferior olive. Direct projections from NOT to the ipsilateral nucleus prepositus hypoglossi (ppH) appeared to be weak, but retrograde tracer injections into rostral ppH verified this projection; furthermore, the injections demonstrated that AON efferents also enter this area. Efferents from the NOT also targeted ascending reticular networks from the pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus and the locus coeruleus. Rostrally, NOT projections included the magnocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus (Ign); the pregeniculate, peripeduncular, and thalamic reticular nuclei; and the pulvinar, the zona incerta, the mesencephalic reticular formation, the intralaminar thalamic nuclei, and the hypothalamus. The NOT could generate optokinetic nystagmus through projections to the AON, the ppH, and the precerebellar nuclei. However, NOT also projects to structures controlling saccades, ocular pursuit, the near response, Ign motion sensitivity, visual attention, vigilance, and gain modification of the vestibule-ocular reflex. Any hypothesis on the function of NOT must take into account its connectivity to all of these visuomotor structures.

The constituent neurons are mostly koniocellular, send virtually no collateral axons to primary visual cortex (V1) and equal about 10% of the V1 population innervating MT.

Yet, while electrophysiological correlates suggest that FO is generated within intracortical networks, contributions of subcortical structures along the trigeminal pathway remain uncertain. Using surface and laminar electrode arrays, in vivo recordings of vibrissal and electrically evoked FO were made within somatosensory cortex of anesthetized rodents before and after ablation of the ventrobasal thalamus (VB) or during reversible cortical cooling. In VB-lesioned animals, vibrissal stimulation failed to evoke FO, while epicortical stimulation in lesioned animals remained effective in generating FO. In nonlesioned animals, cortical cooling eliminated vibrissal-evoked FO despite the persistence of thalamocortical input. Vibrissal-evoked FO returned with the return to physiological temperatures. Results from this study indicate that somatosensory cortex alone is able to initiate and sustain FO. Moreover, these data suggest that cortical network interactions are solely responsible for the generation of FO, while synchronized thalamocortical input serves as the afferent trigger.",nan; ELECTRICAL OSCILLATIONS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; AWAKE MACAQUE; HIPPOCAMPUS; COMPONENTS; NEOCORTEX; NEURONS; DISCHARGES; MECHANISMS; RESPONSES

The projections from the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus (MD) and the mesocortical dopaminergic (DA) projection were examined. No indications were found for a changed pattern of projection from MD in response to either a neonatal or an adult medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) lesion. However, the DA innervation was changed after neonatal mPFC lesions. In the remainder of the mPFC, the DA fibre network proved to be denser, fibres were thicker, had more varicosities, and often the background staining was higher. None of these phenomena were seen in operated adult rats or in controls. It is postulated that the changes in DA innervation might contribute to the sparing of function observed in the spatial delayed alternation task.",FRONTAL CORTEX; RECOVERY; BRAIN DAMAGE; MEDIODORSAL NUCLEUS OF THE THALAMUS; DOPAMINE; RAT; SOCIAL-AGONISTIC BEHAVIOR; DELAYED-ALTERNATION; MEDIODORSAL THALAMUS; FRONTAL-CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; 6-HYDROXYDOPAMINE LESIONS; HOARDING BEHAVIOR; BRAIN-DAMAGE; RADIAL MAZE; ADULT-RATS

Local rates of cerebral metabolism were determined after an intravenous infusion of 1.0 mg/kg cocaine or vehicle in six awake cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) trained to sit calmly in a primate chair. Cocaine administration decreased glucose utilization in a discrete set of structures that included both cortical and subcortical portions of the limbic system. Glucose metabolism in the core and shell of the nucleus accumbens was decreased markedly, and smaller decrements were observed in the caudate and anterior putamen. In addition, cocaine administration produced significant decreases in limbic cortex. Metabolism was decreased in orbitofrontal cortex (areas 11, 12o, 13, 13a, 13b), portions of the gyrus rectus including area 25, entorhinal cortex, and parts of the hippocampal formation. The cortical regions in which functional activity was altered provide dense projections to the nucleus accumbens, and the decreased activity in these projections may be responsible in part for the large alterations in functional activity within the ventral striatum, Decreased metabolism also was evident in the anterior nuclear group of the thalamus, raphe nuclei, and locus ceruleus, The acute cerebral metabolic effects of cocaine in the conscious macaque, therefore, were contained primarily within a set of interconnected limbic regions, including ventral prefrontal cortex, medial temporal regions, the ventral striatal complex, and anterior thalamus. The decreased rates of glucose metabolism reported here resemble decrements found using positron emission tomography in humans. In the rat, by contrast, metabolic activity increased and changes were focused in subcortical regions, The present results represent an important expansion of the neural circuitry on which cocaine acts in the monkey as compared with the rat, and this in turn implies that cocaine affects a broader spectra of behaviors in primates than in rodents.",monkey; cerebral metabolism; cocaine; limbic system; ventral striatum; nucleus accumbens; orbital and medial; prefrontal cortex; POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; GLUCOSE-UTILIZATION; BLOOD-FLOW; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; BINDING-SITES; HUMAN BRAIN; RAT; REWARD; DOPAMINE; PROJECTIONS

Although the striatum is thought to consist of sensorimotor, associative and limbic domains, their precise demarcations and whether additional functional subdivisions exist remain unclear. How striatal inputs are differentially segregated into each domain is also poorly understood. This study presents a comprehensive map of the excitatory inputs to the mouse striatum. The input patterns reveal boundaries between the known striatal domains. The most posterior striatum likely represents the 4th functional subdivision, and the dorsomedial striatum integrates highly heterogeneous, multimodal inputs. The complete thalamo-cortico-striatal loop is also presented, which reveals that the thalamic subregions innervated by the basal ganglia preferentially interconnect with motor-related cortical areas. Optogenetic experiments show the subregion-specific heterogeneity in the synaptic properties of striatal inputs from both the cortex and the thalamus.

In this study, we have employed positron emission tomography measurements of resting brain glucose metabolism (CMRglc) to investigate the neural substrates underlying this dysfunction, taking PD as a model disease to assess, within the framework of Alexander's striato-pallido-thalamo-cortical cognitive circuits the functional neuroanatomy of the central executive. We studied central executive performance in 17 non-demented, highly selected PD patients, by means of the Brown-Peterson paradigm (BPP), and correlated the BPP performance according to various response delays (from 0 to 18 s) with local cerebral metabolic rates of glucose. We document for the first time that the BPP performance in PD is heterogeneous not only across delays (with PD patients selectively impaired for the 0 and 3 s delays, compatible with impaired attention and central executive, respectively), but also from subject to subject; a multiple correspondence analysis was able to distinguish two patient subgroups according to short delay BPP performance. The correlational analysis with PET data evidenced a limited number of significant correlations, most of which were consistent with our working hypothesis. Notably, a positive correlation between lateral frontal relative metabolism and BPP performance for short delays, and a negative one between these scores and mediodorsal (MD) thalamic nucleus metabolism, would fit the way in which caudate dopamine denervation would alter in opposite directions frontal cortex and MD nucleus synaptic activity and in turn affect central executive function.

The modularity is best seen in tangential sections, with double-labeling immunohistochemistry to reveal overlapping or complementary relationships of different markers. The pattern is overall like a reticulum or mosaic but is described as a honeycomb, in which the walls and hollows are composed of distinct afferent and dendritic systems. We demonstrate the main components of the honeycomb in rat visual cortex. These are as follows: (1) zinc-enriched, corticocortical terminations in the walls, and in the hollows, thalamocortical terminations (labeled by antibody against vesicular glutamate transporter 2 and by cytochrome oxidase); (2) parvalbumin-dense neuropil in the walls that partly colocalizes with elevated levels of glutamate receptors 2/3, NMDAR receptor 1, and calbindin; and (3) dendritic subpopulations preferentially situated within the walls (dendrites of layer 2 neurons) or hollows (dendrites of deeper neurons in layers 3 and 5). Because the micromodularity is restricted to layers 2 and 1b, without extending into layer 3, this may be another indication of a laminar-specific substructure at different spatial scales within cortical columns. The suggestion is that corticocortical and thalamocortical terminations constitute parallel circuits at the level of layer 2, where they are segregated in association with distinct dendritic systems. Results from parvalbumin staining show that the honeycomb mosaic is not limited to rat visual cortex but can be recognized at the layer 1-2 border in other areas and species.",columnar organization; zinc-enriched corticocortical terminals; thalamocortical terminals; parvalbumin; dendritic minicolumn; rat visual cortex; cytochrome oxidase; RAT VISUAL-CORTEX; VESICULAR GLUTAMATE TRANSPORTERS; MACAQUE STRIATE CORTEX; CYTOCHROME-OXIDASE; GABAERGIC NEURONS; IMMUNOCYTOCHEMICAL LOCALIZATION; SUBCELLULAR-LOCALIZATION; SUBUNIT IMMUNOREACTIVITY; FUNCTIONAL-ANATOMY; DENDRITE BUNDLES

As a consequence, human brain imaging studies have focused on its role in the sensory perception of emotions. However, evidence from neurophysiological studies in non-human primates have shown that the insula is also involved in generating emotional and communicative facial expressions. In particular, a recent study demonstrated that electrical stimulation of the mid-ventral sector of the insula evoked affiliative facial expressions. The present study aimed to describe the cortical connections of this affiliative field. To this aim, we identified the region with electrical stimulation and injected neural tracers to label incoming and outgoing projections. Our results show that the insular field underlying emotional expression is part of a network involving specific frontal, cingulate, temporal, and parietal areas, as well as the amygdala, the basal ganglia, and thalamus, indicating that this sector of the insula is a site of integration of motor, emotional, sensory and social information. Together with our previous functional studies, this result challenges the classic view of the insula as a multisensory area merely reflecting bodily and internal visceral states. In contrast, it supports an alternative perspective: that the emotional responses classically attributed to the insular cortex are endowed with an enactive component intrinsic to each social and emotional behavior.",mauls; emotion expression; emotion perception; lip-smacking; affiliative field; interoception; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MULTIMODAL ARCHITECTONIC SUBDIVISION; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL SULCUS; OLD-WORLD MONKEY; CORTICAL CONNECTIONS; VENTRAL PREMOTOR; HYPOTHALAMIC HAMARTOMAS; CINGULATE CORTEX; BASAL GANGLIA; INSULA

First, one acallosal brain and 12 normal postmortem hemispheres (five left and seven right sides) were dissected under a microscope using Klingler's fiber dissection technique. We focused on the medial subcallosal area superior to the Muratoff bundle, which has been indicated as a principal target area of the SFOF in previous studies. Second, 90 patients underwent awake craniotomy for gliomas with direct electrical stimulations. Functional examinations for visual, ataxic, and cognitive tasks were performed and 453 positive mapping sites were investigated by voxel-based morphometry analysis to establish the functions of the SFOF. The corticostriatal fibers, or the Muratoff bundle, and thalamic peduncle fibers joined in the area of the caudate nucleus, making thalamic peduncle/ corticostriatal bundles, which ran antero-posteriorly in the anterior subcallosal area and radiated from the caudate superior margin in the posterior subcallosal area. However, no SFOF fiber bundle crossed perpendicular to the thalamic peduncle/ corticostriatal bundles in the posterior subcallosal area. In the acallosal hemispheres, Probst bundles were confirmed and the subcallosal areas did not show a specific organization different from the normal brain. Hence, we could not detect a long and continuous association fascicle connecting the frontal lobe and occipital or parietal lobe in the target areas. Furthermore, in the in vivo functional mappings of awake surgery and voxel-based morphometry analysis, eight positive points on the SFOF were selected from the total 453 positive points, but their functions were not related with visual processing and spatial awareness, as has been reported in previous studies. In conclusion, in the present study we attempted to investigate the existence of the SFOF using an anatomical and functional approach. According to our results, the SFOF may not exist in the human brain.",Acallosal Brain; Awake Surgery; Fiber Dissection; Superior Fronto-occipital Fascicle; Voxel-based Morphometry Analysis; WHITE-MATTER; LANGUAGE PATHWAYS; AWAKE CRANIOTOMY; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; IN-VIVO; CONNECTIVITY; STIMULATION; SURGERY; TRACTS; ATLAS

The clinical signs, both perceptual and motor, of a vestibular tone imbalance in the roll plane are ocular tilt reaction (OTR), ocular torsion, skew deviation and tilts of the perceived visual vertical (SVV). Either complete OTR or skew torsion without head tilt indicates a unilateral peripheral deficit of otolith input or a unilateral lesion of graviceptive brainstem pathways from the vestibular nuclei (crossing midline at the pontine level) to the interstitial nucleus of Cajal (INC) in the rostral midbrain. SVV tilts are the most sensitive sign of a vestibular tone imbalance in roll and occur with peripheral or central vestibular lesions from the labyrinth to the vestibular cortex. All tilt effects, perceptual, ocular motor and postural, are ipsiversive (ipsilateral eye undermost) with unilateral peripheral or pontomedullary lesions below the crossing of the graviceptive pathways. All tilt effects are contraversive (contralateral eye undermost) with unilateral pontomesencephalic brainstem lesions and indicate involvement of the medial longitudinal fasciculus or the rostral midbrain (INC). Unilateral lesions of vestibular structures rostral to the INC typically manifest with deviations of perceived vertical without concurrent eye-head tilt. OTR in unilateral paramedian thalamic infarctions indicates simultaneous ischemia of the paramedian rostral midbrain including the INC. Unilateral lesions of the posterolateral thalamus can cause thalamic astasia and moderate ipsiversive or contraversive SVV tilts, thereby indicating involvement of the vestibular thalamic subnuclei. Unilateral lesions of the parietoinsular vestibular cortex cause moderate, mostly contraversive SVV tilts. An SVV tilt found with monocular but not with binocular viewing is typical for a trochlear or oculomotor palsy rather than a supranuclear graviceptive brainstem lesion.",nan; OCULAR TILT REACTION; MONKEYS MACACA-FASCICULARIS; EYE-HEAD COORDINATION; INTERSTITIAL NUCLEUS; TORSIONAL NYSTAGMUS; SKEW DEVIATION; RHESUS-MONKEY; STIMULATION; NEURONS; CAT

Although pulsatile and continuous infusion paradigms have been described for convective delivery of drugs, the effectiveness and properties of each flow paradigm are unknown. To determine the effectiveness and properties of pulsatile and continuous convective infusion paradigms, the authors compared these convective flow methods in the gray and white matter of primates. Methods. Six primates (Macaca mulatta) underwent convective infusion of Gd-DPTA (5 mM) into the cerebral gray matter (thalamus) or white matter (frontal lobe) using pulsed (intermittent pulses of 15 mu l/min) or continuous (1 mu l/min) convective flow. Results were assessed by clinical MRI and histological analyses. Results. Distribution of Gd-DTPA infusate in gray and white matter by pulsed and continuous flow was clearly identified using MRI, which revealed that both convective flow methods demonstrated an increase in the volume of distribution (Vd) with increasing volume of infusion (Vi) in the surrounding gray and white matter. Although the mean (+/- SD) gray matter Vd:Vi ratio for the pulsed infusions (4.2 +/- 0.5) was significantly lower than the mean Vd:Vi ratio for continuous infusions (5.4 +/- 0.5; a 22% difference [P = 0.0006]), the difference between pulsed (3.8 +/- 0.4) and continuous (4.3 +/- 1.2) infusions in white matter was not significantly different (p = 0.3). Pulsed infusions were associated with more leakback (12.3% +/- 6.4% of Vi) than continuous infusions (3.9% +/- 7.8%), although this difference was not significant (p = 0.2). All animals tolerated the infusions and there was no histological evidence of tissue injury at the infusion sites. Conclusions. Although pulsed and continuous infusion flow paradigms can be safely and effectively used for convective delivery into both gray and white matter, continuous infusion is associated with a higher Vd:Vi ratio than pulsatile infusion in gray matter. High rates of infusion (15 mu l/min) can be used to deliver infusate without any significant leakback and without any clinical or histological evidence of injury.

Recently, molecular biological techniques have enabled us to find rare types of genes expressed in specific neocortical areas. We previously reported occ1 gene as preferentially expressed in the primary visual cortex (V1), using the differential display method. Here, by differential display, we found selective and strong expression of the serum retinol-binding protein (RBP) gene, in higher-order association areas. In V1, RBP mRNA was expressed only in the superficial part of layer II, but its expression increased, involving deeper layers, along the visual pathway. In visual association areas such as TE, RBP mRNA was strongly expressed in both supra- and infragranular layers. In primary auditory and somatosensory areas, as in V1, RBP expression was low, and restricted to the upper part of the supragranular layers. The laminar pattern of RBP expression is in marked contrast with that of occ1; and in early visual areas where both genes are expressed, these occur in distinct sublayers within the supragranular layers. In neonatal monkeys, the area-specific expression pattern of RBP was less distinct, suggesting that the characteristic expression of RBP in higher-order association areas is mainly established postnatally.",area formation; cortical layer; differential display; macaque monkey; RBP; thalamic projection; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; VITAMIN-A-DEFICIENCY; ACID RECEPTOR-ALPHA; SEPTAL CELL-LINE; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; MACAQUE MONKEY; CORTICAL AREAS; VISUAL-CORTEX; DIFFERENTIAL EXPRESSION; CEREBRAL-CORTEX

We report here that many of these deficits could be caused by an inability to actively regulate the position of the finger. Three macaques were trained to maintain the index finger in one position against constant or changing loads. Periodically, torque pulses were used to elicit reflexes in finger muscles. Following unilateral FC lesions, the monkeys failed to adjust finger position during the trials, and the normal M2 long-latency response was absent in the finger muscles. Performance on the task was impaired only in monkeys with complete lesions that included the deep ventral portion of the FC. These results suggest that afferent fibers in the FC regulate finger position, and do so partly through reflexive mechanisms. When the FC is interrupted, the inability to control finger position disturbs fine motor activities.",FINGER MOVEMENTS; REFLEXES; SENSORIMOTOR INTEGRATION; DORSAL COLUMNS; MACAQUE; MOTOR CORTEX; CORTICOMOTONEURONAL CELLS; AFFERENT PATHWAYS; PERIPHERAL INPUT; SENSORY INPUTS; COLUMN LESIONS; STRETCH REFLEX; THALAMIC RELAY; BRAIN-STEM; RESPONSES

Single cortical injections as well as multiple injections at distances of 1-2 mm with one tracer into an extended but coherent cortical region were applied. Fields with multiple injections were placed so that they touched each other (minimal distances 2 to 3 mm). Retrogradely labelled cells in the LGN and/or the pulvinar were arranged in coherent columns, volumes or slabs, but cell volumes resulting from neighbouring cortical injections overlapped at their border (for details of the thalamo-cortical topography see the companion paper Dick et al. (1991). Double labelled cells (dl) were only found in the zones of overlap of the cell volumes labelled by the respective tracers. The relative number of dl-cells in these overlap zones was 6.2 +/- 3.1%. The dl-frequency was the same in the various nuclei of the pulvinar and the LGN. In the main layers of LGN, dl-cells were found only in the overlap zone of two injection fields into area 17, but a few dl-cells were found in interlaminar cells after injections into area 17 and 18. Maximal cortical distances between injection fields which produced dl in the pulvinar, were 3 to exceptionally 4 mm but dl was highest at injection distances less-than-or-equal-to 2.5 mm and decreased sharply at wider distances. Such overlap zones were concerned with identical or overlapping regions of visual field representation in the cortex and probably also in the pulvinar. Although in individual experiments up to four different tracers were injected into different striate/prestriate regions, often embracing the same visual field representation, individual cells in the pulvinar showed dl from maximally only two tracers injected into neighbouring cortical regions. We conclude that dl in the posterior thalamic projection nuclei is determined essentially by cortical distance and thus reflects the local domain of branching of thalamo-cortical afferents. Pruning of such branches during development may further restrict bifurcating axons to identical visual field representations, but representation of identical visual field regions in different visual areas is not, per se, a sufficient condition for dl. It is not found if such regions are further apart from each other than the typical local domain of 2-3 mm, exceptionally up to 4 mm in one experiment after injections into area 17 and MT. D1 in the intralaminar nucleus CeL (5.0 +/- 4.6%), the claustrum (5.4 +/- 3.6%) and in the amygdala (5.7 +/- 1.9%) was of the same order as in the pulvinar and LGN. In the hypothalamus around 10% and in the Nucleus basalis Meynert 15.8% of the cells labelled by visual cortical injections were double labelled. In all these extrathalamic regions dl was also restricted to overlap zones, but overlap of labelled fields in these nuclei was much wider and included the whole striate/prestriate cortex except for some topographical separation of striate and prestriate projection zones in the claustrum. Only in the Nucl. basalis Meynert and the hypothalamus some cells were labelled by three tracers.",VISUAL CORTEX; LATERAL GENICULATE BODY; PULVINAR; FLUORESCENT DYES; DOUBLE LABELING; CALLITHRIX JACCHUS; POSTERIOR-PULVINAR COMPLEX; RETINOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; CORTICAL PROJECTIONS; RHESUS-MONKEY; CAT; CONNECTIONS; SYSTEM; TRACER; AXONS; AREA-17

A proposal is made that both the dorsal and ventral streams must be concurrently active to generate conscious awareness and that V1 (striate cortex) provides a serial link between them. An argument is presented against a true extrastriate communication between the dorsal and ventral streams. Secondly, a detailed theory is developed for the structure of the visual hierarchy. Premotor theory states that each organism-object interaction can be described by the two quantitative measures of torque and change in joint position served by the basal ganglia and cerebellum, respectively. This leads to a component theory of motor efference copy providing a fundamental toot for categorizing dorsal and ventral stream networks. The rationale for this is that the dorsal stream specifies spatial coordinates of the external world, which can be coded by the reafference of changes in joint position. The ventral stream is concerned with object recognition and is coded for by forces exerted on the world during a developmental exploratory phase of the organism. The proposed pathways for a component motor efference copy from both the cerebellum and basal ganglia converge on the thalamus and modulate thalamocortical projections via the thalamic reticular nucleus. The origin of the corticopontine projections, which are a massive pathway for cortical information to reach the cerebellum, coincides with the area typically considered as part of the dorsal stream, whereas the entire cortex projects to the striatum. This adds empirical support for a new conceptualization of the visual streams. The model also presents a solution to the binding problem of a neural correlate of consciousness, that is, how a distributed neural network synchronizes its activity during a cognitive event. It represents a reinterpretation of the current status of the visual hierarchy. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

However, A23 has not yet identified in rodents, and this makes modeling related circuits and diseases in rodents very difficult. Using a comparative approach, molecular markers and unique connectional patterns this study has uncovered the location and extent of possible rodent equivalent (A23 similar to) of the primate A23. A23 similar to but not adjoining areas in the rodents displays strong reciprocal connections with anteromedial thalamic nucleus. Rodent A23 similar to reciprocally connects with the medial pulvinar and claustrum as well as with anterior cingulate, granular retrosplenial, medial orbitofrontal, postrhinal, and visual and auditory association cortices. Rodent A23 similar to projects to dorsal striatum, ventral lateral geniculate nucleus, zona incerta, pretectal nucleus, superior colliculus, periaqueductal gray, and brainstem. All these findings support the versatility of A23 in the integration and modulation of multimodal sensory information underlying spatial processing, episodic memory, self-reflection, attention, value assessment and many adaptive behaviors. Additionally, this study also suggests that the rodents could be used to model monkey and human A23 in future structural, functional, pathological, and neuromodulation studies.",cingulate cortex; retrosplenial cortex; orbital frontal cortex; postrhinal cortex; claustrum; anterior thalamic nucleus; connections; pulvinar; MONKEY RETROSPLENIAL CORTEX; PARIETAL CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; DEFAULT MODE; POSTEROMEDIAL CORTEX; EFFERENT PROJECTIONS; NEURAL CONNECTIONS; ASSOCIATION CORTEX; RAT; THALAMUS

Among cortico-pulvino-cortical systems, the connection between the middle temporal area (MT) and the pulvinar has been thought to contribute significantly to complex motion recognition. Recently, the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), has become a valuable model for a variety of neuroscience studies, including visual neuroscience and translational research of neurological and psychiatric disorders. However, information on projections from MT to the pulvinar in the marmoset brain is scant. We addressed this deficiency by injecting sensitive anterograde viral tracers into MT to examine the distribution of labeled terminations in the pulvinar. The injection sites were placed retinotopically according to visual field coordinates mapped by optical intrinsic imaging. All injections produced anterograde terminal labeling, which was densest in the medial nucleus of the inferior pulvinar (Plm), sparser in the central nucleus of the inferior pulvinar, and weakest in the lateral pulvinar. Within each subnucleus, terminations formed separate retinotopic fields. Most labeled terminals were small but these comingled with a few large terminals, distributed mainly in the dorsomedial part of the Plm. Our results further delineate the organization of projections from MT to the pulvinar in the marmoset as forming parallel complex networks, which may differentially contribute to motion processing. It is interesting that the densest projections from MT target the Plm, the subnucleus recently reported to preferentially receive direct retinal projections. (C) 2020 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

The effort of many neuroanatomists over the past has revealed the general outline of these connections; however, their function remains a mystery. Recently, combined physiological and anatomical approaches are beginning to reveal the role of these connections in the generation of cortical receptive fields. A common theme emerges from all these studies: cortical connections are remarkably specific and this specificity is determined in great extent by the type of connection and the neuronal response properties. Feedforward connections follow relatively rigid rules of wiring selectively targeting neurons with receptive fields matched in position and contrast polarity (thalamus --> cortical layer 4) or position and orientation selectivity (layer 4 --> layers 2 + 3). In contrast, horizontal connections follow more flexible rules connecting distant cells that are not retinotopically aligned and neighboring cells with different orientation preferences. These differences in connectivity may give a hint on how visual stimuli are processed in the primary visual cortex. An attractive hypothesis is that local stimuli use the highly selective feedforward inputs to reliably drive cortical neurons while background stimuli modulate their activity through more flexible horizontal (and feedback) connections.",lateral geniculate nucleus; intracortical; thalamocortical; cortical circuitry; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; CAT STRIATE CORTEX; CROSS-CORRELATION ANALYSIS; SPINY STELLATE NEURONS; CORTICAL SIMPLE CELLS; ORIENTATION SELECTIVITY; MACAQUE MONKEY; COMPLEX CELLS; INHIBITORY INTERNEURONS; INTRINSIC CONNECTIONS

The three principal cortical components of this network are located in the region of the frontal eye fields, posterior parietal cortex, and the cingulate cortex. We injected a retrogradely transported fluorescent dye into the frontal eye fields and another into the posterior parietal cortex of the monkey brain. Large numbers of neurons in the cingulate cortex were retrogradely labeled with each of the two fluorescent dyes. The two types of retrogradely labeled neurons were extensively intermingled, but neurons labeled with both tracers constituted less than 1 % of retrogradely labeled cingulate neurons. Other cortical areas that contained retrograde neuronal labeling included the premotor, lateral prefrontal, orbitofrontal, opercular, posterior parietal, lateral temporal, inferior temporal, parahippocampal, and insular regions. These areas contained neurons labeled with each of the two dyes but virtually no neurons labeled with both. In the thalamus, retrogradely labeled nuclei failed to display evidence of double labeling. The overlap between the two populations of retrogradely labeled neurons was far more extensive at the cortical than at the thalamic level. These observations show that cortical and thalamic projections to the frontal eye fields and posterior parietal cortex do not represent axonal collaterals of single neurons but originate from two distinct and partially overlapping populations of neurons.",nan; MEDIAL PULVINAR NUCLEUS; RHESUS-MONKEY; EYE FIELD; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; INTRACORTICAL MICROSTIMULATION; UNILATERAL NEGLECT; CORTICOCORTICAL CONNECTIONS; CORTICAL CONNECTIONS; SQUIRREL-MONKEYS; MACAQUE MONKEYS

This study provides the first causal evidence that RSC in macaque monkeys is crucial for postoperative retention of preoperatively and postoperatively acquired memories. Preoperatively, monkeys learned 300 object-in-place scene discriminations across sessions. After RSC removal, one-trial postoperative retention tests revealed significant retrograde memory loss for these 300 discriminations relative to unoperated control monkeys. Less robust evidence was found for a deficit in anterograde memory (new postoperative learning) after RSC lesions as new learning to criterion measures failed to reveal any significant learning impairment. However, after achieving a parts per thousand yen90% learning criterion for the postoperatively presented novel 100 object-in-place scene discriminations, short-term retention (i.e., measured after 24 h delay) of this well-learnt set was impaired in the RSC monkeys relative to controls. A further experiment assessed rapid within session acquisition of novel object-in-place scene discriminations, again confirming that new learning per se was unimpaired by bilateral RSC removal.

Recent work in the mouse and the monkey has discovered previously unknown classes of orientation-and direction-selective neurons in LGN. Furthermore, some recent studies in the mouse report that many LGN cells exhibit pronounced orientation biases that are of comparable strength to the subthreshold inputs to V1 neurons. These results raise the possibility that, in rodents, orientation biases of individual LGN cells make a substantial contribution to cortical orientation selectivity. Alternatively, the size and contribution of orientation-or direction-selective channels from LGN to V1 may vary across mammals. To address this question, we examined orientation and direction selectivity in LGN and V1 neurons of a highly visual diurnal rodent: the gray squirrel. In the representation of central vision, only a few LGN neurons exhibited strong orientation or direction selectivity. Across the population, LGN neurons showed weak orientation biases and were much less selective for orientation compared with V1 neurons. Although direction selectivity was weak overall, LGN layers 3abc, which contain neurons that express calbindin, exhibited elevated direction selectivity index values compared with LGN layers 1 and 2. These results suggest that, for central visual fields, the contribution of orientation-and directionselective channels from the LGN to V1 is small in the squirrel. As in other mammals, this small contribution is elevated in the calbindinpositive layers of the LGN",motion; thalamocortical; thalamus; striate cortex; area 17; lateral geniculate body; lateral geniculate bodies; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; RECEPTIVE-FIELD PROPERTIES; CATS STRIATE CORTEX; CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEINS; RHESUS-MONKEY RETINA; TREE SHREW; LAMINAR ORGANIZATION; GREY SQUIRREL; CONTRAST SENSITIVITY

At single-joint level this is accompanied by reduced inhibition of antagonist muscle activity. While normal basal ganglia (BG) contributions to motor control include selecting appropriate muscles by inhibiting others, it is unclear how PD-related changes in BG function cause impaired movement initiation and inhibition at single-joint level. To further elucidate these changes we studied 4 right-hand movement tasks with fMRI, by dissociating activations related to abrupt movement initiation, inhibition and gradual movement modulation. Initiation and inhibition were inferred from ballistic and stepwise interrupted movement, respectively, while smooth wrist circumduction enabled the assessment of gradually modulated movement. Task-related activations were compared between PD patients (N = 12) and healthy subjects (N = 18). In healthy subjects, movement initiation was characterized by antero-ventral striatum, substantia nigra (SN) and premotor activations while inhibition was dominated by subthalamic nucleus (STN) and pallidal activations, in line with the known role of these areas in simple movement. Gradual movement mainly involved antero-dorsal putamen and pallidum. Compared to healthy subjects, patients showed reduced striatal/SN and increased pallidal activation for initiation, whereas for inhibition STN activation was reduced and striatal-thalamo-cortical activation increased. For gradual movement patients showed reduced pallidal and increased thalamo-cortical activation. We conclude that PD-related changes during movement initiation fit the (rather static) model of alterations in direct and indirect BG pathways. Reduced STN activation and regional cortical increased activation in PD during inhibition and gradual movement modulation are better explained by a dynamic model that also takes into account enhanced responsiveness to external stimuli in this disease and the effects of hyper-fluctuating cortical inputs to the striatum and STN in particular.",nan; BASAL GANGLIA CIRCUITS; MOTOR CONTROL; FUNCTIONAL-ANATOMY; RHESUS-MONKEY; ARM MOVEMENTS; DISEASE; INHIBITION; CEREBELLUM; BRAIN; CUES

These areas received connections from the same set of thalamic nuclei, including main inputs from the ventral lateral and ventral anterior complexes, but differed in their patterns of corticocortical connections. Areas 8C and 6Va had reciprocal interconnections, and received similar proportions of afferents from premotor areas 6M and 6DC, and from the prefrontal cortex. However, area 8C received stronger inputs from frontal areas that have been implicated in oculomotor functions, whereas area 6Va received stronger projections from the primary motor area. Somatosensory projections to area 6Va were generally stronger than those to area 8C, and originated from several areas; in contrast, only the second somatosensory area (S2) sent major inputs to area 8C. Finally, although both 6Va and 8C received major inputs from the rostral posterior parietal cortex (putative homologs of areas PE, PF, and PFG), area 8C also received a variety of smaller connections from posterior midline, caudal posterior parietal, and extrastriate areas. Statistical analyses revealed that the pattern of connections of area 8C is more akin to that characterizing a premotor area, rather than a prefrontal area. We conclude that cytoarchitectural area 6Va in the marmoset is similar to ventral premotor areas identified in other simian primates, and that area 8C corresponds to a specialized subdivision of the caudal premotor complex where visual information for the guidance of movements is likely to be emphasized.

The ACC pathway terminated mostly in areas 28 and 35 with a high proportion of large terminals, whereas the pOFC pathway terminated mostly through small terminals in area 36 and sparsely in areas 28 and 35. Both pathways terminated in all layers. Simultaneous labeling of pathways and distinct neurochemical classes of inhibitory neurons, followed by analyses of appositions of presynaptic and postsynaptic fluorescent signal, or synapses, showed overall predominant association with spines of putative excitatory neurons, but also significant interactions with presumed inhibitory neurons labeled for calretinin, calbindin, or parvalbumin. In the upper layers of areas 28 and 35 the ACC pathway was associated with dendrites of neurons labeled with calretinin, which are thought to disinhibit neighboring excitatory neurons, suggesting facilitated hippocampal access. In contrast, in area 36 pOFC axons were associated with dendrites of calbindin neurons, which are poised to reduce noise and enhance signal. In the deep layers, both pathways innervated mostly dendrites of parvalbumin neurons, which strongly inhibit neighboring excitatory neurons, suggesting gating of hippocampal output to other cortices. These findings suggest that the ACC, associated with attention and context, and the pOFC, associated with emotional valuation, have distinct contributions to memory in rhinal cortices, in processes that are disrupted in psychiatric diseases.

The development of ocular dominance bands was studied by transneuronal labeling of the visual cortices of ferret kits between the ages of postnatal day 28 (P28) and P81 after intravitreous injections of either tritiated proline or wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase. Laminar specificity was evident in the youngest animals studied and was similar to that in the adult by P50. In P28 and P30 ferret kits, no modulation reminiscent of ocular dominance bands was detectable in the pattern of labeling along layer IV. By P37 a slight fluctuation in the density of labeling in layer TV was evident in serial reconstructions. By P50, the amplitude of modulation had increased considerably but the pattern of ocular dominance bands did not yet appear mature. The pattern and degree of modulation of the ocular dominance bands resembled that in adult animals by P63. Flat mounts of cortex and serial reconstructions of layer IV revealed an unusual arrangement of inputs serving the two eyes in the region rostral to the periodic ocular dominance bands. In this region, inputs serving the contralateral eye were commonly fused along a mediolateral axis, rostral to which were large and sometimes fused patches of ipsilateral input. J. Comp.

However, in contrast to the extensive studies that have been carried out on the latter area, only a few taste units in the former area have been recorded. To clarify gustatory coding in area 3, we investigated the taste response properties of neurons in area 3 compared with those in area G in alert monkeys by infiltrating into their mouths seven taste stimuli [0.3 M sucrose (S), 0.1 M NaCl (N), 0.01 N HCl (H), 0.003 M quinine-HCl (Q), 0.1 M monosodium glutamate (MSG), distilled water (W), and orange juice (OR)] and artificial saliva (SA). A larger number of HCl-best units and a smaller number of quinine-best units were found in area 3 than in area G. The onset latency and response duration were significantly shorter in area 3 than in area G. Weighted multi-dimensional scaling showed that area G divided eight stimulants into four classes, i.e. two groups (H-Q-W and S-MSG-OR), N and SA, whereas area 3 divided them into three classes (N-MSG-W-OR, S-Q, and H-SA). This suggested that tastants not separated in area G were separated in area 3, and vice versa. This indicates that both areas complement each other in the representation of taste stimuli, each contributing to taste information processing in a different manner.",nan; PRIMATE ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; CHORDA TYMPANI; OPERCULAR CORTEX; TASTE; NEURONS; REPRESENTATION; RESPONSES; TEXTURE; CONNECTIONS; VISCOSITY

Recently, increased attention has focused on using microstimulation to restore functions as diverse as somatosensation and memory. However, how microstimulation changes the neural substrate is still not fully understood. Microstimulation may cause cortical changes that could either compete with or complement natural neural processes, and could result in neuroplastic changes rendering the region dysfunctional or even epileptic. As part of our efforts to produce neuroprosthetic devices and to further study the effects of microstimulation on the cortex, we stimulated and recorded from microelectrode arrays in the hand area of the primary somatosensory cortex (area 1) in two awake macaque monkeys. We applied a simple neuroprosthetic microstimulation protocol to a pair of electrodes in the area 1 array, using either random pulses or pulses time-locked to the recorded spiking activity of a reference neuron. This setup was replicated using a computer model of the thalamocortical system, which consisted of 1980 spiking neurons distributed among six cortical layers and two thalamic nuclei. Experimentally, we found that spike-triggered microstimulation induced cortical plasticity, as shown by increased unit-pair mutual information, while random microstimulation did not. In addition, there was an increased response to touch following spike-triggered microstimulation, along with decreased neural variability. The computer model successfully reproduced both qualitative and quantitative aspects of the experimental findings. The physiological findings of this study suggest that even simple microstimulation protocols can be used to increase somatosensory information flow.",nan; TIMING-DEPENDENT PLASTICITY; MOTOR CORTEX; INTRACORTICAL MICROSTIMULATION; STIMULUS LOCATION; STIMULATION; INFORMATION; NEURONS; AREA; SYNCHRONY; NETWORKS

The parvalbumin pathway, ascending from the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus, is the more direct and terminates in the ventral nucleus. The calbindin pathway is more diffuse in its origins and terminates in the dorsal and medial nuclei. Ventral nucleus neurons are sharply tuned, tonotopically organized and consistent in their responses. They project to core areas of the auditory cortex characterized by high parvalbumin immunoreactivity and by similar neuronal properties. Neurons in the dorsal and medial nuclei are not frequency specific or tonotopic and are labile in their responses. They project more diffusely to belt areas of the auditory cortex in which parvalbumin immunoreactivity is reduced and in which neuronal responses are less specific than in the core. The belt areas are the origins of streams of corticocortical connections leading into the temporal, parietal, and frontal lobes.

Macaque pulvinar includes two subregions that are connected to the visual cortex and are retinotopically organized, but the organizing principles of the visual portions of the human pulvinar are unknown. We employed two tasks to address the question of whether human pulvinar exhibits spatial organization using event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging. The first was a global-motion discrimination with a rich visual stimulus and the second a luminance-discrimination task of similar difficulty that used a minimal visual stimulus. Both tasks required central fixation and covert peripheral attention. A group analysis of blood-oxygen-level-dependent responses elicited in the motion-discrimination task revealed activity bilaterally in the ventral pulvinar (z = 2 in Talairach space). Clear position specificity was observed with activity elicited only by contralateral stimuli. Ipsilateral stimuli caused suppression. This locus of activity is distinct from the more dorsal (z = 10) region of the pulvinar that has previously been reported to be visually responsive but not retinotopic. In the luminance-discrimination task, similar activity was seen, but it was weaker and detectable only in the left pulvinar. In additional experiments with no task, passively viewed global-motion stimuli also activated the ventral pulvinar bilaterally. Our results show for the first time a distinct, bilateral visual representation in human inferior pulvinar that appears to be contralaterally organized.",nan; HUMAN PARIETAL CORTEX; SPATIAL ATTENTION; MACAQUE MONKEY; RETINOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; INFERIOR PARIETAL; FUNCTIONAL MRI; HUMAN THALAMUS; RHESUS-MONKEY; OPTIC FLOW; MOTION

Materials and methods: Eight patients with medication-refractory ET were treated with tcMRgFUS targeting the ventral intermediate nucleus (Vim) of the thalamus contralateral to their dominant hand. Diffusion and structural MRI data and clinical evaluations were acquired pre-treatment and post-treatment. To identify the optimal target location, tractography was performed on pre-treatment diffusion MRI data between the treated thalamus and the hand-knob region of the ipsilateral motor cortex, the entire ipsilateral motor cortex and the contralateral dentate nucleus. The tractography-identified locations were compared to the lesion location delineated on 1 year post-treatment T-2-weighted MR image. Their overlap was correlated with the clinical outcomes measured by the percentage change of the Clinical Rating Scale for Tremor scores acquired pre-treatment, as well as 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year post-treatment. Results: The probabilistic tractography was consistent from subject-to-subject and followed the expected anatomy of the thalamocortical radiation and the dentatothalamic tract. Higher overlap between the tractography-identified location and the tcMRgFUS treatment-induced lesion highly correlated with better treatment outcome (r=-0.929, -0.75, -0.643, p=0.00675, 0.0663, 0.139 for the tractography between the treated thalamus and the hand-knob region of the ipsilateral motor cortex, the entire ipsilateral motor cortex and the contralateral dentate nucleus, respectively, at 1 year post-treatment). The correlation for the tractography between the treated thalamus and the hand-knob region of the ipsilateral motor cortex is the highest for all time points (r=-0.719, -0.976, -0.707, -0.929, p=0.0519, 0.000397, 0.0595, 0.00675 at 1 month, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year post-treatment, respectively).

Previously, this antibody has been found to label neurons associated with the Y-cell stream of processing in cats and the magnocellular or M-cell stream in macaque monkeys. In tree shrews, the antibody selectively labeled layers 1, 2, 4, and 5 of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, layers that are likely to contain neurons previously classified as Y-cells. Of the two layers that contain W-cells, layer 3 was unlabeled and layer 6 was lightly labeled. In area 17, layer 3c was densely stained, as in cats and macaque monkeys. The external half of layer 5 was also densely stained, in contrast to cats where the internal half of layer 5 is stained and macaques where layer 5 is sparsely stained. Area 18 was characterized by dense, uniform staining of inner layer 3 and outer layer 5, but no pattern of alternating light and dense bands crossed the width of area 18 as in macaques. Dense labeling of these same sublayers occurred in cortical areas TA and TD just lateral to area 18. Area TD may be the homologue of area MT of primates, which also stains densely with Cat-301 in macaques.

T(1)-weighted coronal, horizontal, and sagittal MR slices of fixed left cerebral hemispheres were obtained from one male fetus at embryonic days (EDs) 70-150. The timetable for fetal sulcation by MRI was in good agreement with that by gross observations, with a lag time of 10-30 days. A difference in detectability of some sulci seemed to be associated with the length, depth, width, and location of the sulci. Furthermore, MRI clarified the embryonic days of the emergence of the callosal (ED 70) and circular (ED 90) sulci, which remained unpredictable under gross observations. Also made visible by the present MRI were subcortical structures of the forebrain such as the caudate nucleus, globus pallidus, putamen, major subdivisions of the thalamus, and hippocampal formation. Their adult-like features were formed by ED 100, corresponding to the onset of a signal enhancement in the gray matter, which reflects neuronal maturation. The results reveal a highly reproducible level of gross structural changes in the forebrain using a high spatial 7-tesla MRI. The present MRI study clarified some changes that are difficult to demonstrate nondestructively using only gross observations, for example, the development of cerebral sulci located on the deep portions of the cortex, as well as cortical and subcortical neuronal maturation.",Primate; Macaque; Phylogeny; Fetus; Brain; MRI; DIFFUSION-WEIGHTED MR; HUMAN-BRAIN; MACACA-FASCICULARIS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; FETAL; ANISOTROPY; TESLA; MYELINATION; MATURATION; GYRI

Nonetheless, the way cerebellar information is integrated with motor cortical commands and affects their temporal properties remains unclear. To address this issue, we activated the CTC system in primates and found that it efficiently recruits motor cortical cells; however, the cortical response was dominated by prolonged inhibition that imposed a directional activation across the motor cortex. During task performance, cortical cells that integrated CTC information fired synchronous bursts at movement onset. These cells expressed a stronger correlation with reaction time than non-CTC cells. Thus, the excitation-inhibition interplay triggered by the CTC system facilitates transient recruitment of a cortical subnetwork at movement onset. The CTC system may shape neural firing to produce the required profile to initiate movements and thus plays a pivotal role in timing motor actions.",nan; VENTROLATERAL NUCLEUS; MACAQUE MONKEY; CORTEX; NEURONS; THALAMUS; SYNCHRONY; SINGLE; ACTIVATION; MOVEMENT; INPUTS

Rats were given the tracer as a bolus dose plus a constant infusion. In vivo binding in both models was studied before and after presumably having increased interstitial 5HT concentrations using tranylcypromine (TCP), which inhibits the enzyme (monoamine oxidase, MAO), that degrades 5HT. The rat brain tissue was analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to determine the proportion of the PET signal comprising unchanged [C-11]DASB. The binding of [C-11]DASB in the thalamus decreased in both rhesus monkeys and rats after TCP administration.

The most common motor complications consist in wearing-off fluctuations and abnormal involuntary movements appearing when plasma levels of L-dopa are high, commonly referred to as peak-dose L-dopa-induced dyskinesia. Parkinsonian models exhibiting these features have been well-characterized in both rodent and nonhuman primate species. The first animal models of peak-dose L-dopa-induced dyskinesia were produced in monkeys lesioned with N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and treated chronically with L-dopa to elicit choreic movements and dystonic postures. Seminal studies were performed in these models using both metabolic mapping and electrophysiological techniques, providing fundamental pathophysiological insights that have stood the test of time. A decade later, it was shown possible to reproduce peak-dose L-dopa-induced dyskinesia in rats and mice rendered parkinsonian with nigrostriatal 6-hydroxydopamine lesions. When treated with L-dopa, these animals exhibit abnormal involuntary movements having both hyperkinetic and dystonic components. These models have enabled molecular- and cellular-level investigations into the mechanisms of L-dopa-induced dyskinesia. A flourishing literature using genetically engineered mice is now unraveling the role of specific genes and neural circuits in the development of L-dopa-induced motor complications. Both non-human primate and rodent models of peak-dose L-dopa-induced dyskinesia have excellent construct validity and provide valuable tools for discovering therapeutic targets and evaluating potential treatments.

However, there are only a limited number of ligands that can measure the low-density D, receptor in extrastriatal regions and their sensitivity to endogenous dopamine in extrastriatal regions has not yet been fully examined. In this study, the effect of endogenous dopamine on the extrastriatal binding of [C-11]FLB 457 was examined in the rhesus monkey after facilitation with 1 mg/kg of methamphetamine (MAP) and was compared with the effect on the striatal binding of [C-11]raclopride. The indices of receptor binding were obtained by four methods using cerebellum as a reference region. The bindings of [C-11]FLB 457 in the frontal cortex, temporal cortex, and thalamus were not significantly changed after MAP treatment, while the striatal binding of [C-11]raclopride was decreased by more than 20%. These results suggest that [C-11]FLB 457 is not sensitive to endogenous dopamine in the extrastriatal regions of rhesus monkeys, despite a sufficient dose of MAP to decrease the binding of [C-11]raclopride in the striatum.

Direction-selective neurons have been identified in the retina, thalamus, and cortex of many species, but their homology has remained unclear. For instance, it is unknown whether direction-selective retinal ganglion cells (DSGCs) exist in primates and, if so, whether they are the equivalent to mouse and rabbit DSGCs. Here, we used a molecular/circuit approach in both sexes to address these issues. In mice, we identify the transcription factor Satb2 (special AT-rich sequence-binding protein 2) as a selective marker for three RGC types: On-Off DSGCs encoding motion in either the anterior or posterior direction, a newly identified type of Off-DSGC, and an Off-sustained RGC type. In rabbits, we find that expression of Satb2 is conserved in On-Off DSGCs; however, it has evolved to include On-Off DSGCs encoding upward and downward motion in addition to anterior and posterior motion. Next, we show that macaque RGCs express Satb2 most likely in a single type. We used rabies virus-based circuit-mapping tools to reveal the identity of macaque Satb2-RGCs and discovered that their dendritic arbors are relatively large and monostratified. Together, these data indicate Satb2-expressing On-Off DSGCs are likely not present in the primate retina. Moreover, if DSGCs are present in the primate retina, it is unlikely that they express Satb2.",direction selectivity; mouse vision; primate; retina; retinal ganglion cells; visual circuits; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; STARBURST AMACRINE CELLS; RECEPTIVE-FIELD CHARACTERISTICS; SPATIAL PROPERTIES; STRIATE CORTEX; MOUSE; MACAQUE; IDENTIFICATION; NEURONS; ARCHITECTURE

There is convincing evidence that the two cortical systems function as complementary systems in normal cognition, including learning and memory, and that disruption of the interplay between the two lead to profound deficits. On the basis of our own experimental anatomical data in the rat, we suggest that this interplay is mediated by at least three direct and indirect parallel pathways. The first one makes use of direct projections from the hippocampal formation to the prefrontal cortex (PFC), as well as parallel indirect routes through the parahippocampal region. The second pathway comprises the connections of both domains with intrinsically connected parts of the posterior and anterior cingular cortices. Finally, the strong and rather specific reciprocal connections with certain midline and intralaminar thalamic nuclei form a third pathway for hippocampal-prefrontal systems to interact.

(2000). Trends Neurosci., 23: 35-39; Shipp, S. (2003). Philos. Trans. R. Soc. Lond. B Biol. Sci., 358(1438): 1605-1624). During the past several years, we have studied the role of the human pulvinar in visual attention and oculomotor behaviour by testing a small group of patients with unilateral pulvinar lesions. Here we summarize some of these findings, and present new evidence for the role of this structure in both eye movements and visual attention through two versions of a temporal-order judgment task and an antisaccade task. Pulvinar damage induces an ipsilesional bias in perceptual temporal-order judgments and in saccadic decision, and also increases the latency of antisaccades away from contralesional targets. The demonstration that pulvinar damage affects both attention and oculomotor behaviour highlights the role of this structure in the integration of visual and oculomotor signals and, more generally, its role in flexibly linking visual stimuli with context-specific motor responses.",pulvinar; thalamus; human; attention; saccade decision; antisaccade; temporal order judgment; visuomotor transformation; saccade; eye movements; INTERNAL MEDULLARY LAMINA; BEHAVING RHESUS-MONKEY; EYE-MOVEMENTS; PATTERN-DISCRIMINATION; THALAMIC HEMORRHAGE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PRIOR ENTRY; LESIONS; NUCLEI; RESPONSES

Their role in planning novel, as compared to overlearned movement patterns is as yet not well defined. We tested for the involvement of the associative striatum (caudate/anterior putamen) in the generation of novel movement patterns, which is a critical cognitive requirement for non-routine motor behavior. Using event related functional MRI in 14 right-handed male subjects, we analyzed brain activity in the planning phase of four digit finger sequences. Subjects either executed a single overlearned four digit sequence (RECALL), or self-determined four digit sequences of varying order (GENERATE). In both conditions, RECALL and GENERATE, planning was associated with activation in mesial/lateral premotor cortices, motor cingulate cortex, superior parietal cortex, basal ganglia, insula, thalamus, and midbrain nuclei. When contrasting the planning phase of GENERATE with the planning phase of RECALL, there was significantly higher activation within this distributed network. At the level of the basal ganglia, the planning phase of GENERATE was associated with differentially higher activation located specifically within the associative striatum bilaterally. On the other hand, the execution phase during both conditions was associated with a shift of activity towards the posterior part of the putamen. Our data show the specific involvement of the associative striatum during the planning of non-routine movement patterns and illustrate the propagation of activity from rostral to dorsal basal ganglia sites during different stages of motor processing.

We developed a novel neurocomputational model of category learning that particularly addresses the BG-PFC interplay. We propose that the BG bias PFC activity by removing the inhibition of cortico-thalamo-cortical loop and thereby provide a teaching signal to guide the acquisition of category representations in the corticocortical associations to the PFC. Our model replicates key behavioral and physiological data of macaque monkey learning a prototype distortion task from Antzoulatos and Miller (2011). Our simulations allowed us to gain a deeper insight into the observed drop of category selectivity in striatal neurons seen in the experimental data and in the model. The simulation results and a new analysis of the experimental data based on the model's predictions show that the drop in category selectivity of the striatum emerges as the variability of responses in the striatum rises when confronting the BG with an increasingly larger number of stimuli to be classified. The neurocomputational model therefore provides new testable insights of systems-level brain circuits involved in category learning that may also be generalized to better understand other cortico-BG-cortical loops.",basal ganglia; category learning; computational model; physiological data; prefrontal cortex; PRIMATE PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; VISUAL CATEGORIZATION; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; COMPUTATIONAL MODEL; CAUDATE-NUCLEUS; WORKING-MEMORY; ABSTRACT RULES; STRIATUM; NEURONS

Previous reports disagree on which extratemporal areas can be hypometabolic in TLE. Design.-Case series of patients with TLE who underwent interictal fludeoxyglucose F 18 positron emission tomography, compared quantitatively with normal positron emission tomography. Setting.-Patients referred for surgical treatment of medically refractory complex partial seizures. Patients and Other Participants.-Ten normal volunteers; 27 patients with TLE selected to exclude seizures of bilateral temporal or extratemporal onset. Results.-Regional hypometabolism occurred in 25 patients. Hypometabolic regions were ipsilateral to seizure onset and included lateral temporal (in 78% of patients), mesial temporal (70%), thalamic (63%), basal ganglial (41%), frontal (30%), parietal (26%), and occipital (4%). Specific patterns of temporal and extratemporal hypometabolism varied considerably across the TLE group. Conclusions.-Any of the previously reported anatomic areas of hypometabolism can occur in individual patients with TLE. The prevalence of thalamic hypometabolism suggests a pathophysiologic role for the thalamus in initiation or propagation of temporal lobe seizures or in the interictal cognitive dysfunction of TLE.",nan; CEREBRAL GLUCOSE-METABOLISM; POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; SUB-CORTICAL AFFERENTS; RHESUS-MONKEY; PARTIAL SEIZURES; HIPPOCAMPAL-FORMATION; COMPUTED-TOMOGRAPHY; ICTAL EEG; AMYGDALA; PROJECTIONS

Although the anatomical and functional organization of the pulvinar has been extensively studied in old and new world monkeys, little is known about the organization of the human pulvinar. Using high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging at 3 T, we identified two visual field maps within the ventral pulvinar, referred to as vPul1 and vPul2. Both maps contain an inversion of contralateral visual space with the upper visual field represented ventrally and the lower visual field represented dorsally. vPul1 and vPul2 border each other at the vertical meridian and share a representation of foveal space with iso-eccentricity lines extending across areal borders. Additional, coarse representations of contralateral visual space were identified within ventral medial and dorsal lateral portions of the pulvinar. Connectivity analyses on functional and diffusion imaging data revealed a strong distinction in thalamocortical connectivity between the dorsal and ventral pulvinar. The two maps in the ventral pulvinar were most strongly connected with early and extrastriate visual areas. Given the shared eccentricity representationandsimilarity in cortical connectivity, we propose that these two maps form a distinct visual field map cluster and perform related functions. The dorsal pulvinar was most strongly connected with parietal and frontal areas. The functional and anatomical organization observed within the human pulvinar was similar to the organization of the pulvinar in other primate species.",connectivity; DTI; fMRI; pulvinar; retinotopy; visual; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; HUMAN SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; MACAQUE MONKEY; RETINOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; INFERIOR PULVINAR; HUMAN THALAMUS; RHESUS-MONKEY; AREA MT

These zones are at the origin of parallel basal ganglia-thalamocortical subloops involved in modulating the cortical motor output. However, it is still largely unknown how parietal and prefrontal areas, connected to premotor areas, and involved in controlling higher order aspects of motor control, project to the basal ganglia. Based on tracer injections at the cortical level, we analyzed the corticostriatal projections of the macaque hand-related ventrolateral prefrontal, ventral premotor, and inferior parietal areas forming a network for controlling purposeful hand actions (lateral grasping network). The results provided evidence for partial overlap or interweaving of these projections in correspondence of 2 putaminal zones, distinct from the motor putamen, one located just rostral to the anterior commissure, the other in the caudal and ventral part. Thus, the present data provide evidence for partial overlap or interweaving in specific striatal zones (input channels) of projections from multiple, even remote, areas taking part in a large-scale functionally specialized cortical network. Furthermore, they suggest the presence of multiple hand-related input channels, possibly differentially involved in controlling goal-directed hand actions.",basal ganglia; grasping; monkey; striatum; VENTROLATERAL PREFRONTAL AREAS; SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA; FRONTAL EYE FIELD; VENTRAL PREMOTOR CORTEX; BASAL-GANGLIA; MACAQUE MONKEY; CORTICAL CONNECTIONS; INFERIOR PARIETAL; FUNCTIONAL-PROPERTIES; RHESUS-MONKEY

Noting their connections with the basal ganglia, the locomotor disturbances that occur following lesions of the PPN or cMRF, and the encouraging results of PPN deep brain stimulation in Parkinson's disease patients, both the PPN and cMRF have been linked to motor control. In order to determine the existence of and characterize vestibular responses in the PPN and cMRF, we recorded single neurons from both structures during vertical and horizontal rotation, translation, and visual pursuit stimuli. The majority of PPN cells (72.5%) were vestibular-only (VO) cells that responded exclusively to rotation and translation stimuli but not visual pursuit. Visual pursuit responses were much more prevalent in the cMRF (57.1%) though close to half of cMRF cells were VO cells (41.1%). Directional preferences also differed between the PPN, which was preferentially modulated during nose-down pitch, and cMRF, which was preferentially modulated during ipsilateral yaw rotation. Finally, amplitude responses were similar between the PPN and cMRF during rotation and pursuit stimuli, but PPN responses to translation were of higher amplitude than cMRF responses. Taken together with their connections to the vestibular circuit, these results implicate the PPN and cMRF in the processing of vestibular stimuli and suggest important roles for both in responding to motion perturbations like falls and turns.

We have identified, using non-radioactive in situ hybridization histochemistry, that D-3 mRNA-positive neurons are highly concentrated in the ventral striatum, efferents of the ventral striatum (globus pallidus internal, ventral palladium, substantia nigra pars reticulata), and in regions projecting to the ventral striatum (medial dorsal thalamus, nucleus basalis, extended amygdala). DQ receptors are also highly enriched in the limbic striatal-pallidal-thalamic loop, exhibiting segregation from the D-2 receptor-enriched motor loop. This supports data developed in rats showing that the D-3 receptor is a target of the mesolimbic DA system that can modulate the limbic striato-palladial-thalamic Loop. However, D-2 and D-3 receptors and their mRNAs are co-localized in many sensory regions (lateral and medial geniculate nuclei, basolateral and basomedial amygdala, regions of thalamus), suggesting mechanisms of cross-talk, We have also demonstrated that there are 35% elevations in D-3 receptor number in ventral striatal neurons and their striatopalladial targets in schizophrenics that is reduced by concurrent antipsychotic treatment. Chronic haloperidol treatment to rats for 6 months with a 2-month withdrawal does not result in elevated D-3 receptor number. We hypothesize that antipsychotic treatment via D-3 receptors returns balance to limbic efferents of the ventral striatum. We established that early neonatal damage to the nigrostriatal DA system in rats produces characteristic adaptations in the pre- and post-synaptic components of the mesolimbic DA system that can provide a model to explore regulation by antipsychotics. This includes elevated release of DA from the mesolimbic DA terminals, elevated D-3 receptor mRNA in the Islands of Calleja and nucleus accumbens, and enhanced behavioral response to psychostimulants.",nan; MESSENGER-RNA EXPRESSION; DOPAMINE-RECEPTOR; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; RHESUS-MONKEY; RAT STRIATUM; HUMAN-BRAIN; HALOPERIDOL TREATMENT; EFFERENT CONNECTIONS; MIDBRAIN PROJECTIONS; SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA

It has been implicated in human disorders of social and emotional behavior, such as autism. Of the interconnected functional networks, considerable research in rodents and primates has focused on connections between the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). The amygdala projects to OFC by both a direct amygdalocortical (AC) pathway and an indirect pathway through mediodorsal thalamus. In the rat, retrograde tracer experiments indicate that the AC and amygdalothalamic (AT) pathways originate from separate populations, and may therefore convey distinctive infonnation, although the characteristics of these pathways remain unclear. To investigate this issue in monkeys we made anterograde tracer injections in the basolateral amygdala complex (BLC; n = 3). Three distinctive features were found preferentially associated with the AT or AC pathways. First, AT terminations are large (average diameter = 3.5 mu m; range = 1.2-7.0 mu m) and cluster around proximal dendrites, in contrast with small-bouton AC terminations. Second, AT terminations form small arbors (diameter approximate to 0.1 mm), while AC are widely divergent (often > 1.0 mm long). The AT terminations features are reminiscent of large bouton, driver corticothalamic terminations. Finally, AC but not AT terminations are positive for zinc (Zn), a neuromodulator associated with synaptic plasticity. From these results we suggest that AC and AT terminations originate from distinct populations in monkey as well as in rodent. Further work is necessary to determine the degree and manner of their segregation and how these subsystems interact within a broader connectivity network.",driver; emotion; single axon; social behavior; synaptic boutons; zinc; MEDIODORSAL THALAMIC NUCLEUS; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; CORTICAL AREAS TE; MACAQUE MONKEY; BASOLATERAL AMYGDALA; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEYS; FRONTAL-LOBE; SYNAPTIC ORGANIZATION; MACACA-FASCICULARIS

The density of D-1 receptors, VMAT2, and DAT was measured using [H-3]SCH23390, [H-3]dihydrotetrabenazine, and [H-3]WIN35428, respectively. The density of D-2 and D-3 receptors was calculated using the D-3-preferring radioligand, [H-3] WC-10 and the D-2-preferring radioligand [H-3]raclopride using a mathematical model developed previously by our group. Dopamine D-1, D-2, and D-3 receptors are extensively distributed throughout striatum; the highest density of D-3 receptors occurred in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). The density of the DAT is 10-20-fold lower than that of VMAT2 in striatal regions. Dopamine D-3 receptor density exceeded D-2 receptor densities in extrastriatal regions, and thalamus contained a high level of D-3 receptors with negligible D-2 receptors. The density of dopamine D-1 linearly correlated with D-3 receptor density in the thalamus. The density of the DAT was negligible in the extrastriatal regions whereas the VMAT2 was expressed in moderate density. D-3 receptor and VMAT2 densities were in similar level between the aged human and aged rhesus brain samples, whereas aged human brain samples had lower range of densities of D-1 and D-2 receptors and DAT compared with the aged rhesus monkey brain. The differential density of D-3 and D-2 receptors in human brain will be useful in the interpretation of PET imaging studies in human subjects with existing radiotracers, and assist in the validation of newer PET radiotracers having a higher selectivity for dopamine D-2 or D-3 receptors.",nan; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; AUTORADIOGRAPHIC LOCALIZATION; MESSENGER-RNA; MONKEY BRAIN; RAT-BRAIN; IN-VIVO; SELECTIVE RADIOLIGAND; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS; AFFINITY STATES; HUMAN FOREBRAIN

While some memory inadequacies in OSA may result from earlier-described structural deficits in the hippocampus, mammillary body injury also could contribute, since these structures receive projections from the hippocampus via the fornix, project heavily to the anterior thalamus, and have been implicated in other conditions with memory deficiencies, such as Korsakoff's syndrome. However, volume loss in mammillary bodies has not been reported in OSA, likely a consequence of logistic difficulties in size assessment. We evaluated mammillary body volumes in 43 OSA (mean age +/- S.D., 46.9 +/- 9.2 years; mean apnea-hypopnea-index +/- S.D., 31.2 +/- 19.9 events/h) and 66 control subjects (age, 47.3 +/- 8.9 years). Two high-resolution T1-weighted image volumes were collected on a 3.0 T magnetic resonance scanner, averaged to improve signal-to-noise, and reoriented (without warping) into a common space. Brain sections containing both mammillary bodies were oversampled, and the bodies were manually traced and volumes calculated. OSA patients showed significantly reduced left, right, and combined mammillary body volumes compared with control subjects, after partitioning for age, gender, and head size (multivariate linear model, p < 0.05). Left-side mammillary bodies showed greater volume reduction than the right side. Diminished mammillary body volume in OSA patients may be associated with memory and spatial orientation deficits found in the syndrome. The mechanisms contributing to the volume loss are unclear, but may relate to hypoxic/ischemic processes, possibly assisted by nutritional deficiencies in the syndrome. (c) 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

NTAR is composed of two modules. The neuroanatomical term extraction (NTE) module employs a hidden Markov model (HMM) in conjunction with lexical rules to extract neuroanatomical terms (NT) and acronyms (NA) from textual material. The output of the NTE is formatted into collections of term- or acronym-indexed documents composed of sentences and word phrases extracted from textual material. The second information retrieval (IR) module utilizes a vector space model (VSM) and includes a novel, automated relevance feedback algorithm. The IR module retrieves statistically related neuroanatomical terms and acronyms in response to queried neuroanatomical terms and acronyms. Neuroanatomical terms and acronyms retrieval obtained from term-based inquiries were compared with (1) term retrieval obtained by including automated relevance feedback and with (2) term retrieval using document-to-document comparisons (context-based VSM). The retrieval of synonymous and similar primate and macaque thalamic terms and acronyms in response to a query list of human thalamic terminology by these three IR approaches was compared against a previously published, manually constructed concordance table of homologous cross-species terms and acronyms. Term-based VSM with automated relevance feedback retrieved 70% and 80% of these primate and macaque terms and acronyms, respectively, listed in the concordance table. Automated feedback algorithm correctly identified 87% of the macaque terms and acronyms that were independently selected by a domain expert as being appropriate for manual relevance feedback. Context-based VSM correctly retrieved 97% and 98% of the primate and macaque terms and acronyms listed in the term homology table. These results indicate that the NTAR system could assist neuroscientists with thesauri creation for closely related, highly detailed neuroanatomical domains.",neuroanatomical term extraction; information retrieval; vector space model; automated relevance feedback; neuroanatomical domains; nan

In this study, the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of a live attenuated CV-A16 candidate, K168-8Ac, were evaluated in a rhesus monkey model. Four passages of this strain (P35, P50, P60, and P70) were administered to monkeys, and its protective effect was identified. The immunized monkeys were clinically asymptomatic, except for slight fever. Weak viraemia was observed, and two doses of vaccination were found to significantly reduce virus shedding. High levels of antibody responses were observed (1:1024-1:2048), along with a significant increase in plasma IL-8. The I.M. group showed a much stronger humoural immunity. Pathological damage was detected mainly in lung tissues, although thalamus, spinal cord, lymph nodes, and livers were involved. After the viral challenge, it was found that two doses of vaccine reduced virus shedding, and the degree of lung damage and the number of organs involved decreased as the passage number increased.

This work aims to quantify the receptor density (B-max) of alpha 4 beta 2* nAChRs and the in vivo (apparent) dissociation constant (K-Dapp) of [F-18]nifene. Multiple-injection [F-18]nifene experiments with varying cold nifene masses were conducted on four rhesus monkeys with a microPET P4 scanner. Compartment modeling techniques were used to estimate regional B-max values and a global value of K-Dapp. The fast kinetic properties of [F-18]nifene also permitted alternative estimates of B-max and K-Dapp at transient equilibrium with the same experimental data using Scatchard-like methodologies. Averaged across subjects, the compartment modeling analysis yielded B-max values of 4.8 +/- 1.4, 4.3 +/- 1.0, 1.2 +/- 0.4, and 1.2 +/- 0.3 pmol/mL in the regions of antereoventral thalamus, lateral geniculate, frontal cortex, and subiculum, respectively.

Tinnitus pathophysiology has been repeatedly shown to involve both auditory and non-auditory brain structures, making network-level studies of tinnitus critical. In this magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study, two resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) approaches were used to better understand functional network disturbances in tinnitus. First, we demonstrated tinnitus-related reductions in RSFC between specific brain regions and resting-state networks (RSNs), defined by independent components analysis (ICA) and chosen for their overlap with structures known to be affected in tinnitus. Then, we restricted ICA to data from tinnitus patients, and identified one RSN not apparent in control data. This tinnitus RSN included auditory-sensory regions like inferior colliculus and medial Heschl's gyrus, as well as classically non-auditory regions like the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus, striatum, lateral prefrontal, and orbitofrontal cortex. Notably, patients' reported tinnitus loudness was positively correlated with RSFC between the mediodorsal nucleus and the tinnitus RSN, indicating that this network may underlie the auditory-sensory experience of tinnitus. These data support the idea that tinnitus involves network dysfunction, and further stress the importance of communication between auditory-sensory and fronto-striatal circuits in tinnitus pathophysiology.

The injected cortical regions were identified electrophysiologically. Retrograde labeling in Cl reveals two different projection patterns. The first pattern is characterized by a clear topographic organization and is composed of two parts. The somatosensory Cl shows a dorsoventral progression of cells projecting to the hindpaw, forepaw, and face representations of S1. The visual Cl has cells projecting to the vertical meridian representation of V1 surrounded dorsally by neurons projecting to the representation of retinal periphery. A second pattern of Cl projections is composed of neurons that are distributed diffusely through the nucleus. In both somatosensory and visual sectors, these intermingle with the topographically projecting cells, Neurons retrogradely labeled from cortical injections are always present in the AIN. In the central medial nucleus, the segregation of modality is evident: The visual-projecting sector is dorsal, and the somatosensory is ventral. Projections from the central lateral nucleus display detectable somatotopic and retinotopic organization: Individual regions are preferentially connected with specific representations of S1 or V1. In the paracentral nucleus, no clear regional preferences are detectable. Also performed were comparisons of the proportions of neurons projecting to different sensory representations. Projections to V1 from both AIN and Cl are biased towards the retinal periphery representation. S1 projection preference is for the forepaw representation in Cl and for the hindpaw in the AIN. The quantitative analysis of multiply labeled cells reveals that, compared to Cl, the AIN contains a higher proportion of neurons branching between different representations of S1 or V1. The concept of topographic vs. diffuse projecting systems is reviewed and discussed, and functional implications of quantitative analysis are considered.

The two D1R subtypes, D-1 and D-5, cannot be pharmacologically distinguished but have important functional differences. To understand their contributions to cortical function, we quantified their localization in the neuropil of primate PFC. We identified different patterns of distribution for the two receptors that showed variation across cortical laminae. Although D-1 was enriched in spines and D-5 in dendrites, there was considerable overlap in their distribution within neuronal compartments. To determine whether the D-1 and D-5 receptors are localized to separate populations of synapses, we employed double-labeling methods. We found the two receptors colocalized and quantified the overlap of their distribution in spines and axon terminals of prefrontal cortical area 9 in the Macaca mulatta monkey. The two receptors are found in partially overlapping populations, such that the D-5 receptor is found in a subpopulation of those spines and terminals that contain D-1. These results indicate that dopamine activation of the two D1R subtypes does not modulate disparate populations of synapses onto dendritic spines in prefrontal cortical area 9; rather, dopamine can activate D-1 and D-5 receptors on the same spines, plus an additional group of spines that contains only D-1. The implications of these results for the dose-dependent relationship between D1R activation and PFC function are discussed.",electron microscopy; circuitry; working memory; primate; ultrastructure; pyramidal cells; prefrontal cortex; METABOTROPIC GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; NUCLEOTIDE-BINDING PROTEINS; WORKING-MEMORY DEFICITS; MONKEY CEREBRAL-CORTEX; PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; D1 RECEPTORS; SUBSYNAPTIC LOCALIZATION; SYNAPTIC CONNECTIONS; STRIATAL ASTROCYTES; THALAMIC NUCLEI

Existence of this second pathway in primates, however, is not well established. A major question centers on whether the pulvinar acts as a relay, particularly in the path from the superior colliculus (SC) to the motion area in middle temporal cortex (MT). We used physiological microstimulation to identify pulvinar neurons belonging to the path from SC to MT in the macaque. We made three salient observations. First, we identified many neurons in the visual pulvinar that received input from SC or projected to MT, as well as a largely separate set of neurons that received input from MT. Second, and more importantly, we identified a subset of neurons as relay neurons that both received SC input and projected to MT. The identification of these relay neurons demonstrates a continuous functional path from SC to MT through the pulvinar in primates. Third, we histologically localized a subset of SC-MT relay neurons to the subdivision of inferior pulvinar known to project densely to MT but also localized SC-MT relay neurons to an adjacent subdivision. This pattern indicates that the pulvinar pathway is not limited to a single anatomically defined region. These findings bring new perspective to the functional organization of the pulvinar and its role in conveying signals to the cerebral cortex.",nan; OLD-WORLD MONKEYS; FRONTAL EYE FIELD; INFERIOR PULVINAR; MACAQUE MONKEY; RHESUS-MONKEY; VISUAL-CORTEX; MACACA-MULATTA; ARCHITECTONIC SUBDIVISIONS; TOPOGRAPHIC ORGANIZATION; PARABIGEMINAL NUCLEUS

In the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), cells show distinct properties such as selectivity for particular wavelengths, increments or decrements in contrast, or preference for fine detail versus rapid motion. No studies, however, have measured how LGN cells respond when an animal is challenged to make a perceptual decision using information within the receptive fields of those LGN cells. In this study we measured neural activity in the macaque LGN during a two-alternative, forced-choice (2AFC) contrast detection task or during a passive fixation task and found that a small proportion (13.5%) of single LGN parvocellular (P) and magnocellular (M) neurons matched the psychophysical performance of the monkey. The majority of LGN neurons measured in both tasks were not as sensitive as the monkey. The covariation between neural response and behavior (quantified as choice probability) was significantly above chance during active detection, even when there was no external stimulus. Interneuronal correlations and task-related gain modulations were negligible under the same condition. A bottom- up pooling model that used sensory neural responses to compute perceptual choices in the absence of interneuronal correlations could fully explain these results at the level of the LGN, supporting the hypothesis that the perceptual decision pool consists of multiple sensory neurons and that response fluctuations in these neurons can influence perception.",thalamus; vision; perceptual decision; choice probability; RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; GENERAL ANESTHETIC ACTIONS; RECEPTIVE-FIELD PROPERTIES; MONKEY AOTUS-TRIVIRGATUS; CHOICE-RELATED ACTIVITY; SACCADIC EYE-MOVEMENTS; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; CONTRAST-SENSITIVITY; MACAQUE MONKEYS; AREA MT

We performed principal component analysis (PCA) to identify latent volumetric systems on regional brain volumes and correlated these patterns with clinical characteristics; further, we performed exploratory structural equation modeling (SEM) to testa priori hypotheses about the organization among the structures comprising the CSTC and LCSTC circuits, and to investigate differences among subjects with bipolar disorder (BD), major depressive disorder (MDD), and healthy controls (HC). Participants included 45 BD and 31 MDD patients, and 72 HC. Regional MR brain volumes were used to calculate patterns of volumetric covariance. The identified latent volumetric systems were related to the depression severity and the duration of illness. BD differed from HC on the estimated parameters describing the paths of cortico-striatal, thalamo-striatal and intrastriatal loops of the CSTC circuit, and the paths between anterior and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), and hippocampus to amygdala of the LCSTC circuit. MDD differed from HC on the paths between putamen and thalamus, and PCC to hippocampus. This study provides evidence to suggest different organizational patterns among structures within the CSTC and LCSTC circuits for BD.

We used an amphetamine challenge combined with pharmacologic magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI) to map DA-associated circuitry in nonhuman primates with high sensitivity and spatial resolution. Seven control cynomolgous monkeys and 10 MPTP(1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine)-treated parkinsonian primates were studied longitudinally using both positron emission tomography ( PET) and phMRI. Amphetamine challenge (2.5 mg/kg, i.v.) in control monkeys increased relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) in a number of brain regions not described previously, such as parafascicular thalamus, precentral gyrus, and dentate nucleus of the cerebellum. With the high spatial resolution, we were also able to readily identify changes in rCBV in the anterior cingulate, substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area, caudate (tail and head), putamen, and nucleus accumbens. Amphetamine induced decreases in rCBV in occipital and posterior parietal cortices. Parkinsonian primates had a prominent loss of response to amphetamine, with relative sparing of the nucleus accumbens and parafascicular thalamus. There was a significant correlation between rCBV loss in the substantia nigra and both PET imaging of dopamine transporters and behavioral measures. Monkeys with partial lesions as defined by 2alpha-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-fluorophenyl) tropane binding to dopamine transporters showed recruitment of premotor and motor cortex after amphetamine stimulus similar to what has been noted in Parkinson's patients during motor tasks.

An adult female Macaca nemestrina (pigtail macaque) weighing 7.2 kg was used in constructing this atlas. CT, PET, and MRI were performed on the monkey before the specimen's head was frozen and cryoplaned. Closely spaced (50 mu m) images of the specimen blockface were then digitally acquired and modified to produce whole head and brain-only 3D image sets. The resulting data sets were organized into a digital volume and repositioned into a stereotaxic coordinate system defined by Horsley and Clark in 1908 [7]. Orthogonal images were obtained by digitally resampling the volume in order to produce a full set of coronal, sagittal, and horizontal images. Stereotaxic reference grids were applied to each image indicating the A/P, M/L, or H-c position within the digital volume. Specific anatomic structures were outlined from the cryosection data set and 3D surface models reconstructed. Structural labels indicating nuclei, tracts, and other neuroanatomical features were incorporated into coronally sliced cryosection images spaced at 500 mu m. The CT, PET, and MRI data sets were reconstructed into a digital volume and coregistered to the cryosection volume. All images constructed from this 3D map are available for public access via the Internet using an anonymous file transfer protocol (FTP) and the World Wide Web (http://www.loni.ucla.edu). The foremost advantage of this digital map is an integrated multimodality three-dimensional representation of the Macaca nemestrina brain, which is not possible with traditional atlases.

They all had typical signs of vestibular dysfunction such as transient rotatory vertigo with vomiting at the onset, ipsiversive body and ocular lateropulsion, and a complete ocular tilt reaction with tilts of the subjective visual vertical. Compared with healthy volunteers, who show activation in a network of temporoparietal vestibular areas within both hemispheres, especially in the posterior insula and retroinsular region that contains the human homologue of the parietoinsular vestibular cortex (PIVC) in monkeys, the activation pattern of the patients with Wallenberg's syndrome was typically changed. During caloric irrigation of the ear ipsilateral to the side of the lesion, they showed no or significantly reduced activation in the contralateral hemisphere, whereas the activation pattern in the ipsilateral hemisphere appeared normal. These results are compatible with bilateral ascending vestibular pathways from the vestibular nuclei to the vestibular cortex. The novel finding in all three patients was that the activation patterns were compatible with the assumption that only the crossing fibers from the medial vestibular subnucleus to the contralateral medial longitudinal fascicle were affected, but the ipsilateral vestibular thalamocortical projections via the superior vestibular subnucleus were spared. Thus, the activation pattern in the PET study may reflect the vestibular tonic imbalance within the vestibular nuclei circuitry at the cortical level.",vestibular cortex; caloric stimulation; Wallenberg's syndrome; PET; activation study; hemispheric dominance; thalamocortical projections; MONKEYS MACACA-FASCICULARIS; CALORIC STIMULATION; NEURONS; PROJECTIONS; CAT; IDENTIFICATION; LOCALIZATION; ACTIVATION; MORPHOLOGY; RESPONSES

Recent studies indicate that M13 bacteriophage, a very large nanoparticle, binds to beta-amyloid and alpha-synuclein proteins, leading to plaque disaggregation in models of Alzheimer and Parkinson disease. To determine the feasibility, safety, and characteristics of convection-enhanced delivery (CED) of M13 bacteriophage to the brain, the authors perfused primate brains with bacteriophage. Methods. Four nonhuman primates underwent CED of M13 bacteriophage (900 nm) to thalamic gray matter (4 infusions) and frontal white matter (3 infusions). Bacteriophage was coinfused with Gd-DTPA (1 mM), and serial MRI studies were performed during infusion. Animals were monitored for neurological deficits and were killed 3 days after infusion. Tissues were analyzed for bacteriophage distribution. Results. Real-time T1-weighted MRI studies of coinfused Gd-DTPA during infusion demonstrated a discrete region of perfusion in both thalamic gray and frontal white matter. An MRI-volumetric analysis revealed that the mean volume of distribution (Vd) to volume of infusion (Vi) ratio of M13 bacteriophage was 2.3 +/- 0.2 in gray matter and 1.9 +/- 0.3 in white matter. The mean values are expressed +/- SD. Immunohistochemical analysis demonstrated mean Vd:Vi ratios of 2.9 +/- 0.2 in gray matter and 2.1 +/- 0.3 in white matter. The Gd-DTPA accurately tracked M13 bacteriophage distribution (the mean difference between imaging and actual bacteriophage Vd was insignificant [p > 0.05], and was -2.2% +/- 9.9% in thalamic gray matter and 9.1% +/- 9.5% in frontal white matter). Immunohistochemical analysis revealed evidence of additional spread from the initial delivery site in white matter (mean Vd:Vi, 16.1 +/- 9.1). All animals remained neurologically intact after infusion during the observation period, and histological studies revealed no evidence of toxicity. Conclusions. The CED method can be used successfully and safely to distribute M13 bacteriophage in the brain. Furthermore, additional white matter spread after infusion cessation enhances distribution of this large nanoparticle. Real-time MRI studies of coinfused Gd-DTPA (1 mM) can be used for accurate tracking of distribution during infusion of M13 bacteriophage.

To examine the cellular bases for these differences, we exposed rhesus macaque fetuses to x-rays during early gestation (embryonic day [E]30E42), i.e., before the onset of corticogenesis, or in midgestation (E70E81), when superficial cortical layers are generated. Animals were delivered at term (approximate to E165), and the size and cellular composition of prefrontal association cortex (area 46) examined in adults using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and stereologic analysis. Both early and midgestational radiation exposure diminished the surface area and volume of area 46. However, early exposure spared cortical thickness and did not alter laminar composition, and due to higher cell density, neuron number was within the normal range. In contrast, exposure to x-rays at midgestation reduced cortical thickness, mainly due to elimination of neurons destined for the superficial layers. A cell-sparse gap, observed within layer III, was not filled by the later-generated neurons destined for layer II, indicating that there is no subsequent replacement of the lost neurons. The distinct areal and laminar pathology consequent to temporally segregated irradiation is consistent with basic postulates of the radial unit hypothesis of cortical development. In addition, we show that an environmental disturbance inflicted in early gestation can induce subtle cytoarchitectonic alterations without loss of neurons, such as those observed in schizophrenia, whereas midgestational exposure causes selective elimination of neurons and cortical thinning as observed in some forms of mental retardation and fetal alcohol syndrome.

Pyramidal neurons in PFC deep layer 3 play a central role in both thalamocortical and corticocortical circuitry. Given that somal size tends to be associated with both the dendritic and axonal architecture of a neuron, abnormalities in these circuits in schizophrenia may be associated with a change in the somal size of deep layer 3 pyramidal neurons. Methods: We used design-based stereology to estimate the somal volume of pyramidal neurons in deep layer 3 of PFC area 9 in 28 subjects with schizophrenia, each of whom was matched to 1 normal comparison subject for sex, age, and postmortem interval. Results: The geometric mean of the somal volume estimates in the subjects with schizophrenia was significantly (P=.02) decreased by 9.2%. This decrease was associated with a shift in the distribution of somal volumes toward smaller sizes. Neither antipsychotic medication treatment history nor duration of illness was associated with somal size. Conclusions: These findings independently replicate previous reports of decreased somal size in the PFC in schizophrenia. The reduction in size of deep layer 3 pyramidal neurons is consistent with abnormalities in thalamocortical and corticocortical circuitry, suggesting that disruption of these circuits may contribute to cognitive abnormalities in schizophrenia.",nan; GRAY-MATTER VOLUME; DENDRITIC SPINE DENSITY; CEREBRAL BLOOD-FLOW; WORKING-MEMORY; N-ACETYLASPARTATE; MACAQUE MONKEY; HEMISPHERIC-DIFFERENCES; AXON TERMINALS; FRONTAL-LOBE; MEDIODORSAL

The rare surviving geniculate projection neurons were retrogradely labelled by horseradish peroxidase (HRP) from extra-striate cortex and retinogeniculate terminals were labelled by an intraocular injection of HRP. Retinal terminals in the degenerated dLGN made synaptic contact exclusively with the dendrites of interneurons immunopositive for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in both parvocellular and magnocellular regions of dLGN. As well as being postsynaptic to retinal terminals these vesicle-containing dendrites were pre- and postsynaptic to other similar dendrites, and presynaptic to relay cells. Surviving labelled projection neurons received retinal input indirectly, via both the GABA-immunopositive interneurons and GABA-immunonegative terminals characteristic of those from the superior colliculus. In the degenerated, as opposed to the normal dLGN, about 20% of retinal terminals were GABA-immunopositive and GABA-immunoreactivity was prominently elevated in the ganglion and amacrine cell layers of the degenerated half of the retina. The optic nerve also contained numerous GABA-immunopositive axons but very few such axons were found in a normal optic nerve processed in identical manner. The surviving pathways from the retina must underlie the visual abilities that survive striate cortical removal in monkeys and human patients and may involve the degenerated dLGN as well as the mid-brain.",VISUAL CORTEX; RETINA; THALAMUS; BLIND-SIGHT; GABA; CHOLINERGIC AMACRINE CELLS; GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRIC ACID; GANGLION-CELLS; MACAQUE MONKEY; RABBIT RETINA; POSTSYNAPTIC POTENTIALS; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; GABAERGIC NEURONS; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; CORTEX LESIONS

This introduces the possibility of a re-entrant motion signal affecting the relay of the retinal input through the LGN to the visual cortex. The question is whether the response of LGN cells to moving stimuli involves a component derived from this feedback. By producing a reversible focal pharmacological block of the activity of an MT direction column we show the presence of such an influence from MT on the responses of magno, parvo and koniocellular cells in the macaque LGN. The pattern of effect in the LGN reflects the direction bias of the MT location inactivated. This suggests a moving stimulus is captured by iterative interactions in the circuit formed by visual cortical areas and visual thalamus. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Tracers were visualized using standard immunohistochemistry or evaluated in vivo using manganese (Mn2+) as an MRI paramagnetic tracer. The in vivo tract tracing turned out to be very sensitive with a high correspondence to the histological labelling. Tracers injected into the mediodorsal thalamus labelled the medial and rostral pole of the frontal lobe as well as the anterior cingulate, anterior insular and dorsomedial frontal cortices. Subsequently, the reciprocity and specificity of these connections were tested from injections into the traced frontal cortices indicating that the PFC has cortical connections to different parts of the MD nucleus. Although the granular layer IV, characteristic of primate PFC could not be identified, both cytoarchitectonic and connectional data suggests that the Gottingen minipig has a structurally divided prefrontal cortex. Stereological estimates of PFC volume showed that the Gottingen minipig PFC constitutes about 24% of the total neocortex volume and 10% of the total brain volume. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Anderson et al. (2006) used anterograde tracers to label the projection from the dorsal CN (DCN) to the MG in guinea pigs. We examined this pathway with retrograde tracers. The results confirm a pathway from the DCN, originating primarily from the deep layers. Labeled cells included a few giant cells and a larger number of small cells of unknown type. Many more labeled cells were present in the ventral CN (VCN). These cells, identifiable as multipolar (stellate) or small cells, were found throughout much of the VCN. Most of the labeled cells were located contralateral to the injection site. The CN to MG pathway bypasses the inferior colliculus (IC), where most ascending auditory information is processed. Anderson et al. (2006) hypothesized that CN-MG axons are collaterals of axons that reach the IC. We tested this hypothesis by injecting different fluorescent tracers into the MG and IC and examining the CN for double-labeled cells. After injections on the same side of the brain, double-labeled cells were found in the contralateral VCN and DCN. Most double-labeled cells were in the VCN, where they accounted for up to 37% of the cells labeled by the MG injection. We conclude that projections from the CN to the MG originate from the VCN and, less so, from the DCN. A significant proportion of the cells send a collateral projection to the IC. Presumably, the collateral projections send the same information to both the MG and the IC. The results suggest that T-stellate cells of the VCN are a major source of direct projections to the auditory thalamus.",thalamus; multipolar cells; T-stellate; magnocellular pathway; fear conditioning; lemniscal pathway; multimodal processing; collateral projections; PARALLEL AUDITORY PATHWAYS; NITRIC-OXIDE SYNTHASE; GUINEA-PIG; INFERIOR COLLICULUS; NADPH-DIAPHORASE; COMMISSURAL NEURONS; RETROGRADE TRACERS; MULTIPOLAR CELLS; RHESUS-MONKEY; RAT

Little is known about the impact of amblyopia on the white matter within the visual system. We studied the properties of six major visual white-matter pathways in a group of adults with amblyopia (n = 10) and matched controls (n = 10) using diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and fiber tractography. While we did not find significant differences in diffusion properties in cortico-cortical pathways, patients with amblyopia exhibited increased mean diffusivity in thalamo-cortical visual pathways. These findings suggest that amblyopia may systematically alter the white matter properties of early visual pathways. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

There is growing evidence that such knowledge may be acquired through a number of different means, each perhaps with its own neuronal substrate. One major distinction is between serial order information acquired intentionally and leading to explicit conscious knowledge of the sequence structure, and information acquired incidentally through experience. While this latter form of knowledge influences behaviour, it may do so without the participant being aware of the sequential information, i.e. it is acquired implicitly. Evidence from physiological and lesion studies in animals and imaging studies in humans suggests that these two forms of learning may have dissociable neuronal substrates. Specifically, the striato-thalamo-cortical circuit centred on the caudate nucleus is proposed to be involved in intentional sequence learning and that based on the putamen on incidental learning. The present study tested one part of this proposed dissociation by assessing patients with Huntington's disease on tasks of the two forms of learning. On the test of trial-and-error intentional learning there were marked deficits, which were closely related to disease progression and to measures of executive cognitive dysfunction. This finding was in contrast to the finding from the incidental learning task. Performance of the Huntington's disease group was essentially normal and unrelated to measures of disease progression and cognitive status. The results, although supportive of the proposed dual-system hypothesis, offer only partial confirmation. Further direct study is required using similar tasks in patients with putamenal disorder or lesions within the skeletomotor striato-thalamo-cortical circuit.",striatum; cognition; SRT task; implicit learning; trial-and-error learning; REACTION-TIME-TASK; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA; MINI-MENTAL-STATE; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; BASAL GANGLIA; CAUDATE-NUCLEUS; MACAQUE MONKEY; COGNITIVE PERFORMANCE; VISUOMOTOR SEQUENCE

Recently, we showed that such stimulation of a part of the PPC in the caudal lateral sulcus (LS) elicits eye movements in these monkeys. Here, we studied the functional and anatomical connections of this oculomotor region we call parietal eye field (PEF) with frontal eye field (FEF) and other cortical regions in 2 squirrel monkeys. We demonstrated these connections with intrinsic optical imaging and injections of anatomical tracers. Optical imaging of frontal cortex during stimulation of the PEF evoked focal functional activation within FEF. Tracing studies confirmed the functional PEF-FEF connections. Moreover, tracer injections revealed PEF connections with other PPC regions on the dorsolateral and medial brain surface, cortex in the caudal LS, and visual and auditory cortical association areas. Subcortical projections of PEF were primarily with superior colliculus, and pontine nuclei as well as nuclei of the dorsal posterior thalamus and caudate. These findings suggest that PEF in squirrel monkey is homologous to lateral intraparietal (LIP) area of macaque, supporting the notion that these brain circuits are organized similarly to mediate ethologically relevant oculomotor behaviors.",frontal eye field; intracortical microstimulation; lateral intraparietal cortex; neuronal tracers; optical imaging; LATERAL INTRAPARIETAL AREA; SACCADE-RELATED ACTIVITY; DORSOMEDIAL VISUAL AREA; CORTICAL CONNECTIONS; INFERIOR PARIETAL; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; OWL MONKEYS; INTRACORTICAL MICROSTIMULATION; RHESUS-MONKEY; MACAQUE MONKEYS

In the primates, two of the three major subdivisions, the lateral and inferior pulvinar, are heavily interconnected with a significant proportion of the visual association cortex. However, while we now have a better understanding of the bidirectional connectivity of these pulvinar subdivisions, its functions remain somewhat of an enigma. Over the past few years, researchers have started to tackle this problem by addressing it from the angle of development and visual cortical lesions. In this review, we will draw together literature from the realms of studies in nonhuman primates and humans that have informed much of the current understanding. This literature has been responsible for changing many long-held opinions on the development of the visual cortex and how the pulvinar interacts dynamically with cortices during early life to ensure rapid development and functional capacity Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest involvement of the pulvinar following lesions of the primary visual cortex (V1) and geniculostriate pathway in early life which have far better functional outcomes than identical lesions obtained in adulthood. Shedding new light on the pulvinar and its role following lesions of the visual brain has implications for our understanding of visual brain disorders and the potential for recovery.",visual system; development; thalamus; hemianopia; blindsight; infants; pulvinar; MIDDLE TEMPORAL AREA; MACAQUE MONKEY; HIERARCHICAL DEVELOPMENT; INFERIOR PULVINAR; MOTION COHERENCE; EARLY MATURATION; BLINDSIGHT; CORTEX; VISION; FIELD

Most studies have evaluated effects of the OP nerve agent soman (pinacolyl methylphosphonofluoridate), an irreversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase. Soman-induced acute and chronic morphological changes have been examined. The effects of nerve agent therapy (i.e. pyridostigmine, praloxidime chloride and atropine), with and without an anticonvulsant (i.e. diazepam, midazolam), on soman-induced lesions have also been studied. Acute changes in the central nervous system of rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys exposed to soman alone or soman and therapy, without an anticonvulsant, were characterized by neuronal degeneration and necrosis and neuropil edema. The lesions were usually present in the frontal cortex, entorhinal cortex, amygdaloid complex, caudate nucleus, thalamus and hippocampus. Morphologically, these lesions resemble lesions produced by hypoxic-ischemic injury or by seizures and are similar to soman-induced changes in other laboratory animals. Nerve agent therapy supplemented with an anticonvulsant reduced or prevented soman-induced acute neural lesions. Acute changes in non-neural tissues were limited to the heart (e.g. hemorrhage, myofiber necrosis, myocarditis) and skeletal muscle (e.g. myofiber necrosis). Heart lesions in the non-human primate are similar to OP-induced heart lesions in man. The pathogenesis of the acute lesions in both the central nervous system and heart is discussed.

In order to better localize these changes, we assessed volume and neuronal number of the pulvinar and several of its subdivisions in postmortem material from subjects with chronic SZ and subjects with no psychiatric history. Total pulvinar volume and neuronal number were significantly lower in SZ and these differences were significant in only in its medial division. The medial pulvinar interconnects various heteromodal cortical regions suggesting that these deficits may contribute to the abnormalities of higher order integrative functions characteristic of schizophrenia.

However, growing recognition of the dopamine (DA) loss and other pathology in extra-striatal brain regions has led to uncertainty whether loss of DA in the striatum is sufficient to cause parkinsonian signs. We tested this hypothesis by infusing cis-flupenthixol (cis-flu: a broad-spectrum D1/D2 receptor antagonist) into different regions of the macaque putamen (3 hemispheres of 2 monkeys) while the animal performed a visually-cued choice reaction time task in which visual cues indicated the arm to reach with and the peripheral target to contact to obtain food reward. Following reward delivery, the animal was required to self-initiate release of the peripheral target and return of the chosen hand to its home position (i.e., without the benefit of external sensory cues or immediate rewards). Infusions of cis-flu at 15 of 26 sites induced prolongations of reaction time (9 of 15 cases), movement duration (6 cases), and/or dwell time of the hand at the peripheral target (8 cases). Dwell times were affected more severely (+ 95%) than visually-triggered reaction times or movement durations (+25% and +15%, respectively). Specifically, the animal's hand often 'froze' at the peripheral target for up to 25-s, similar to the akinetic freezing episodes observed in PD patients. Across injections, slowing of self-initiation did not correlate in severity with prolongations of visually-triggered reaction time or movement duration, although the latter two were correlated with each other. Episodes of slowed self-initiation appeared primarily in the arm contralateral to the injected hemisphere and were not associated with increased muscle co-contraction or global alterations in behavioral state (i.e., inattention or reduced motivation), consistent with the idea that these episodes reflected a fundamental impairment of movement initiation. We found no evidence for an anatomic topography within the putamen for the effects elicited. We conclude that acute focal blockade of DA transmission in the putamen is sufficient to induce marked akinesia-like impairments. Furthermore, different classes of impairments can be induced independently, suggesting that specific parkinsonian signs have unique pathophysiologic substrates. (C) 2012 Elsevier Inc.

However, the structural organization of the IPCC is a controversial issue. For example, cytoarchitectonic parcellations reported in the literature range from 2 to 7 areas. Moreover, anatomical descriptions of the human IPCC are often based on experiments in the macaque monkey. In this study, we used diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging combined with probabilistic tractography to quantify the connectivity of the human IPCC, and used this information to parcellate this cortex area. This provides a new structural map of the human IPCC, comprising 3 subareas (inferior parietal cortex anterior, IPC middle, and IPC posterior) of comparable size, in a rostro-caudal arrangement in the left and right hemispheres. Each subarea is characterized by a connectivity fingerprint, and the parcellation is similar to the subdivision reported for the macaque IPCC with 3 areas in a rostro-caudal arrangement (PF, PFG, and PG). However, the present study also reliably demonstrates new structural features in the connectivity pattern of the human IPCC, which are not known to exist in the macaque.

Acetylcholinesterase messenger RNA had-similar to acetylcholinesterase enzymatic activity-a widespread distribution in human brain. Acetylcholinesterase messenger RNA positive cells corresponded to perikarya rich in acetylcholinesterase activity in most but not all regions. Examples for mismatches included the inferior olive and human cerebellar cortex. The presence of hybridization signals in cerebral cortex and an enrichment in layer III and V of most isocortical areas confirmed that perikaryal acetylcholinesterase in cerebral cortex is of postsynaptic origin and not derived from cholinergic projections. In striatum the expression of high levels of acetylcholinesterase messenger RNA was restricted to a small population of large striatal neurons. In addition, low levels of expression were found in most medium sized striatal neurons. Cholinergic neurons tended to express high levels of acetylcholinesterase messenger RNA whereas in cholinoceptive neurons the levels were moderate to low. However, some noncholinergic neurons like dopaminergic cells in substantia nigra, noradrenergic cells in locus coeruleus, serotoninergic cells in raphe dorsalis, GABAergic cells in thalamic reticular nucleus, granular cells in cerebellar cortex and pontine relay neurons expressed levels comparable to cholinergic neurons in basal forebrain. It is suggested that neurons expressing high levels of acetylcholinesterase messenger RNA may synthesize acetylcholinesterase for axonal transport whereas neurons with an expression of acetylcholinesterase confined to somatodendritic regions tend to contain lower levels of acetylcholinesterase messenger RNA.",nan; RAT SUBSTANTIA NIGRA; HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; DFP-TREATED MONKEYS; CONTAINING NEURONS; DOPAMINERGIC-NEURONS; CHOLINERGIC NEURONS; MOLECULAR-FORMS; NUCLEUS BASALIS; MORPHOLOGICAL-CHARACTERISTICS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE

Recently, it has been suggested that progressive supranuclear palsy tauopathy may spread in the brain from cell to cell in a 'prion-like' manner. However, direct experimental evidence of this phenomenon, and its consequences on brain functions, is still lacking in primates. In this study, we first derived sarkosyl-insoluble tau fractions from post-mortem brains of patients with progressive supranuclear palsy. We also isolated the same fraction from age-matched control brains. Compared to control extracts, the in vitro characterization of progressive supranuclear palsy-tau fractions demonstrated a high seeding activity in P301S-tau expressing cells, displaying after incubation abnormally phosphorylated (AT8- and AT100-positivity), misfolded, filamentous (pentameric formyl thiophene acetic acid positive) and sarkosyl-insoluble tau. We bilaterally injected two male rhesus macaques in the supranigral area with this fraction of progressive supranuclear palsy-tau proteopathic seeds, and two other macaques with the control fraction. The quantitative analysis of kinematic features revealed that progressive supranuclear palsy-tau injected macaques exhibited symptoms suggestive of parkinsonism as early as 6 months after injection, remaining present until euthanasia at 18 months. An object retrieval task showed the progressive appearance of a significant dysexecutive syndrome in progressive supranuclear palsy-tau injected macaques compared to controls. We found AT8-positive staining and 4R-tau inclusions only in progressive supranuclear palsy-tau injected macaques. Characteristic pathological hallmarks of progressive supranuclear palsy, including globose and neurofibrillary tangles, tufted astrocytes and coiled bodies, were found close to the injection sites but also in connected brain regions that are known to be affected in progressive supranuclear palsy (striatum, pallidum, thalamus). Interestingly, while glial AT8-positive lesions were the most frequent near the injection site, we found mainly neuronal inclusions in the remote brain area, consistent with a neuronal transsynaptic spreading of the disease. Our results demonstrate that progressive supranuclear palsy patient-derived tau aggregates can induce motor and behavioural impairments in non-human primates related to the prion-like seeding and spreading of typical pathological progressive supranuclear palsy lesions. This pilot study paves the way for supporting progressive supranuclear palsy-tau injected macaque as a relevant animal model to accelerate drug development targeting this rare and fatal neurodegenerative disease. We undertook a study of skin cancer (SC) recognition and health promotion among interns in an Irish hospital. While the knowledge on SC was good, the majority of the interns did not practice safe sun behaviours themselves, and the majority did not feel confident in diagnosing skin lesions or SC. Most had never performed a skin examination on patients, or discussed sun protection or skin self examination with their patients.",tau; tauopathy; prion-like; progressive supranuclear palsy; parkinsonism; non-human primate; NIGROSTRIATAL DEGENERATION; MACAQUE MODEL; TAUOPATHIES; TRANSMISSION; DEFICITS; STRAINS

This state-dependence is believed to arise, at least in part, in response to inputs from subcortical structures that release neuromodulators such as acetylcholine, often nonsynaptically. The mechanisms that underlie the interaction between these nonsynaptic signals and the more point-to-point synaptic cortical circuitry are not well understood. This review highlights the state of the field, with a focus on cholinergic action in early visual processing. Key anatomical and physiological features of both the cholinergic and the visual systems are discussed. Furthermore, presenting evidence of cholinergic modulation in visual thalamus and primary visual cortex, we explore potential functional roles of acetylcholine and its effects on the processing of visual input over the sleep-wake cycle, sensory gain control during wakefulness, and consider evidence for cholinergic support of visual attention.",LGN; macaque; neuromodulation; primate; V1; visual cortex; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; MUSCARINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; BRAIN-STEM CORE; SUBUNIT MESSENGER-RNAS; CORTICAL AREAS V1; BASAL FOREBRAIN; NORADRENERGIC MODULATION; IMMUNOREACTIVE NEURONS; NICOTINIC RECEPTORS

This would be reflected in significant structural differences between poor-outcome (i.e., Kraepelinian) and non-Kraepelinian patients. To assess this possibility, we have evaluated the degree of deviation in brain structure in Kraepelinian patients with respect to controls and non-Kraepelinian schizophrenia patients. We used voxel-brain morphometry (VBM) to assess the differences in gray matter volume across the brain in the Kraepelinian group with respect to the healthy controls and non-Kraepelinian patients. Twenty-six Kraepelinian and 18 non-Kraepelinian schizophrenia patients and 41 healthy controls were included. With respect to the healthy controls, the Kraepelinian patients showed a very significant decrease in gray matter in the frontal, occipital, and limbic cortices, and, at a subcortical level, bilaterally in the striatum and thalamus. In comparison with the non-Kraepelinian patients, the Kraepelinian individuals continued to show a similar subcortical decrease.

While MMN has been extensively used in human electrophysiological studies of auditory processing, the neural mechanisms and brain regions underlying its generation remain unclear. We investigate possible homologs of the MMN in macaque primary auditory cortex (A1) using a frequency oddball paradigm in which rare deviant tones are randomly interspersed among frequent standard tones. Standards and deviants had frequencies equal to the best frequency (BF) of the recorded neural population or to a frequency that evoked a response half the amplitude of the BF response. Early and later field potentials, current source density components, multiunit activity, and induced high-gamma band responses were larger when elicited by deviants than by standards of the same frequency. Laminar analysis indicated that differences between deviant and standard responses were more prominent in later activity, thus suggesting cortical amplification of initial responses driven by thalamocortical inputs. However, unlike the human MMN, larger deviant responses were characterized by the enhancement of obligatory responses rather than the introduction of new components. Furthermore, a control condition wherein deviants were interspersed among many tones of variable frequency replicated the larger responses to deviants under the oddball condition. Results suggest that differential responses under the oddball condition in macaque A1 reflect stimulus-specific adaptation rather than deviance detection per se. We conclude that neural mechanisms of deviance detection likely reside in cortical areas outside of A1.",nan; GAMMA-BAND ACTIVITY; VOICE ONSET TIME; POPULATION RESPONSES; INFERIOR COLLICULUS; EVOKED POTENTIALS; ANURAN CEREBELLUM; ODDBALL PARADIGM; MACAQUE MONKEY; FREQUENCY; CAT

However, recent evidence in non-human primates, along with some evidence in humans with damaged primary visual cortex (e.g., blindsight for motion in the blind visual hemifield), have argued for the existence of a direct thalamic-to-extrastriate projection for motion processing. This evidence remains controversial. Here we tested the idea that direct thalamic input to extrastriate motion processing areas exists in humans but might be masked in scalp recordings by activity from early visual areas. To do this, we employed stimuli that induced strong refractory effects in primary visual cortex-thereby creating a brief reversable lesion in primary visual cortex-immediately before the presentation of a motion stimulus. Under these conditions, we then assessed whether motion areas of cortex were still able to process the motion stimuli by recording event-related potentials (ERPs) and event-related magnetic fields (ERFs/MEG). We found robust motion-related activity in extrastriate motion processing areas in the ERP and MEG signals even when primary visual cortex was heavily suppressed by our manipulation. This finding provides evidence for a direct thalamic functional pathway to extrastriate visual cortical motion processing areas in the human that bypasses primary visual cortex.

The following study utilized a double labeling paradigm, using antibodies that recognize non-NMDA ionotropic glutamate receptor subunits and other neuronal markers, to further define, quantitatively, the subclasses of neurons that contain immunoreactivity for the AMPA/kainate and kainate receptor subunits in the monkey prefrontal cortex. Double labeling with an antibody that recognizes common epitopes in AMPA/kainate subunits GluR2 and GluR3 (GluR2/3) in combination with an antibody that recognizes the kainate receptor subunits GluR5, GluR6, and GluR7 (GluR5/6/7) demonstrated that immunoreactivity for these two receptor classes was highly colocalized in a great majority of the pyramidal neurons in this region but present in only a minority of neurochemically identified subclasses of GABAergic interneurons. Furthermore, GluR2/3 immunoreactivity had principally a somatic distribution whereas GluR5/6/7 labeling was predominately found in the perikarya and/or particular dendritic domains. In contrast, intense GluR1 labeling was observed in a small subpopulation of interneurons and low GluR1 immunoreactivity was present in many other cortical neurons. These results demonstrate that there is a high degree of specificity in the distribution of AMPA/kainate and kainate receptor-class proteins to subclasses of neurons within the neocortex. A neuron's combination of excitatory amino acid receptor subunits may regulate its response to excitatory inputs and further defines the role of identified subclasses of neurons in the complex circuitry of the cerebral cortex and may also indicate the basis for the apparent cellular selectivity of excitotoxic degenerative processes.",EXCITATORY AMINO ACIDS; GLUTAMATE; AMPA; KAINATE; RECEPTORS; NEUROFILAMENTS; CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEINS; MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEINS; PRIMATE; NEOCORTEX; COLOCALIZATION STUDIES; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; CORTICAL-NEURONS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; KAINIC ACID; NEUROFIBRILLARY TANGLES; FUNCTIONAL EXPRESSION; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODY; NERVOUS-SYSTEM; NMDA-RECEPTOR

However, the mechanisms by which attention modulates neuronal communication to guide behaviour are poorly understood. To elucidate the synaptic mechanisms of attention, we developed a sensitive assay of attentional modulation of neuronal communication. In alert monkeys performing a visual spatial attention task, we probed thalamocortical communication by electrically stimulating neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus while simultaneously recording shock-evoked responses from monosynaptically connected neurons in primary visual cortex. We found that attention enhances neuronal communication by increasing the efficacy of presynaptic input in driving postsynaptic responses, by increasing synchronous responses among ensembles of postsynaptic neurons receiving independent input, and by decreasing redundant signals between postsynaptic neurons receiving common input. The results demonstrate that attention finely tunes neuronal communication at the synaptic level by selectively altering synaptic weights, enabling enhanced detection of salient events in the noisy sensory environment.",nan; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; MACAQUE AREA V4; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; SPATIAL ATTENTION; NEURONAL RESPONSES; SIMPLE CELLS; MONKEY; V1; PERFORMANCE

There is no age-related change in the cross-sectional area of the fornix, but there is a significant loss of myelinated nerve fibers. The loss of myelinated nerve fibers is accompanied by a significant increase in the numbers of nerve fibers that show degeneration of their axons and alterations in myelin sheaths. Aging also brings about an increase in the frequency of profiles of paranodes, indicating that some of the nerve fibers are being remyelinated. Aging also affects neuroglial cells. Each type shows inclusions in their perikarya, and in the case of astrocytes and microglial cells some of these inclusions are phagocytosed myelin. Numbers of astrocytes and microglial cells do not appear to increase with age, but there is a 20% increase in oligodendrocytes. When correlations with cognitive impairments displayed by individual monkeys are examined, the decreased packing density of nerve fibers and the increasing frequency of nerve fibers with degenerating axons and of nerve fibers with altered myelin sheaths all correlate with increasing cognitive impairment. It is suggested that these correlations result from some disconnection of the hippocampus from the thalamus, septal nuclei, and medial frontal cortex and from reductions in the conduction velocity brought about by the shorter internodal lengths of remyelinated nerve fibers in the fornix.

We hypothesize that the striatum, the subthalamic nucleus (STN), the internal globus pallidus (GPi), the thalamus, and the cortex are involved in closed feedback loops through the hyperdirect and direct pathways. These loops support a competition process that results in the ability of BG to make a cognitive decision followed by a motor one. Considering lateral cortical interactions, another competition takes place inside the cortex allowing the latter to make a cognitive and a motor decision. We show how this dual competition endows the model with two regimes. One is driven by reinforcement learning and the other by Hebbian learning. The final decision is made according to a combination of these two mechanisms with a gradual transfer from the former to the latter.

Here, we have newly developed a stereotaxic neuronal recording system for awake marmosets under the head-fixed condition by modifying that for macaque monkeys. Using this system, we recorded neuronal activity in the cerebral cortex of awake marmosets and successfully identified the primary motor cortex by intracortical microstimulation. Neuronal activities of deep brain structures, such as the basal ganglia, thalamus, and cerebellum, in awake marmosets were also successfully recorded referring to magnetic resonance images. Our system is suitable for functional mapping of the brain, since the large recording chamber allows access to arbitrary regions over almost the entire brain, and the recording electrode can be easily moved stereotaxically from one site to another. In addition, our system is desirable for neuronal recording during task performance to assess motor skills and cognitive function, as the marmoset sits in the marmoset chair and can freely use its hands. Moreover, our system can be used in combination with cutting-edge techniques, such as two-photon imaging and optogenetic manipulation. This recording system will contribute to boosting neuroscience and medical research using marmosets. (C) 2018 The Authors.

The present study used extracellular injections of PHA-L to delineate extrinsic axon arbors and to assess the possibility of categories that might correlate with these specific neuronal subpopulations. Two distinct types of terminations were found. Type I have smaller caliber preterminal axons, are generally elongate, and are studded with spinelike terminal specializations. Type II have larger axons (> 1.0 mu m), spherical arbors, and mainly beaded specializations, some of which are conspicuously large (approximate to 3.0 mu m).

Here, we review and compare behavioural and neural data on temporal and sequential processing during beat perception and entrainment tasks in macaques (induding direct neural recording and local field potential (LFP)) and humans (including fMRI, EEG and MEG). These abilities rest upon a distributed set of circuits that include the motor cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamo-cortical (mCBGT) circuit, where the supplementary motor cortex (SMA) and the putamen are critical cortical and subcortical nodes, respectively. In addition, a cortical loop between motor and auditory areas, connected through delta and beta oscillatory activity, is deeply involved in these behaviours, with motor regions providing the predictive timing needed for the perception of, and entrainment to, musical rhythms. The neural discharge rate and the LFP oscillatory activity in the gamma- and beta-bands in the putamen and SMA of monkeys are tuned to the duration of intervals produced during a beat synchronization continuation task (SCT). Hence, the tempo during beat synchronization is represented by different interval-tuned cells that are activated depending on the produced interval. In addition, cells in these areas are tuned to the serial-order elements of the SCT. Thus, the underpinnings of beat synchronization are intrinsically linked to the dynamics of cell populations tuned for duration and serial order throughout the mCBGT. We suggest that a cross-species comparison of behaviours and the neural circuits supporting them sets the stage for a new generation of neurally grounded computational models for beat perception and synchronization.",beat perception; beat synchronization; neurophysiology; modelling; PREMOTOR CORTEX; BASAL GANGLIA; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; AUDITORY SEQUENCES; BAND OSCILLATIONS; TIME PERCEPTION; VISUAL RHYTHMS; MOTOR AREAS; SYNCHRONIZATION; BRAIN

Cortical cells projecting to the caudal medulla were confined to the contralateral layer V with their descending axons crossing the midline at the level of pyramidal decussation. Cortical afferents to Sp5C originated from cells located mainly in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1) and the insular cortex, whereas cortical projections to the Cu originated mainly from the primary motor cortex (M1), the primary and secondary somatosensory cortex (S1 and S2). The SRD received dense cortical afferents from larger, widespread cortical areas: M1, M2, S1, S2, and the insular cortex. The existence of dense cortico-SRD connections supports the possibility of a pyramidal influence over SRD neurons, which might modify nociceptive information ascending to the cortex itself. This proposal is consistent with the fact that SRD efferents terminate densely in thalamic areas that influence sensorimotor cortical regions which in turn project to the SRD. Moreover, these corticofugal mechanisms could allow the cortex to select its own input by suppressing or augmenting transmission of signals through SRD-hindbrain/forebrain pathways or by coordinating activities in spino-SRD-spinal circuits and thus selecting the relevant information produced by the noxious stimulus.

Although brain regions involved in strategic memory retrieval in general have been identified, differences in retrieval operations related to distinct retrieval strategies are not well-understood. Thus, our aim was to identify brain regions whose activity is differentially involved in spatial-associative and temporal-associative retrieval. First, we showed that our behavioral paradigm probing memory for a set of object-location associations promoted the use of a spatial-associative structure following an encoding condition that provided Multiple associations to neighboring objects (spatial-associative condition) and the use of a temporal-associative structure following another study condition that provided predominantly temporal associations between sequentially presented items (temporal-associative condition). Next, we used an adapted version of this paradigm for functional MRI, where we contrasted brain activity related to the recall of object-location associations that were either encoded in the spatial- or the temporal-associative condition. In addition to brain regions generally involved in recall, we found that activity in higher-order visual regions, including the fusiform gyrus, the lingual gyrus, and the cuneus, was relatively enhanced when subjects used a spatial-associative structure for retrieval. In contrast, activity in the globus pallidus and the thalamus was relatively enhanced when subjects used a temporal-associative structure for retrieval. In conclusion, we provide evidence for differential involvement of these brain regions related to different types of strategic memory retrieval and the neural structures described play a role in either spatial-associative or temporal-associative memory retrieval.",basal ganglia; humans; thalamus; declarative memory; fMRI; BASAL GANGLIA OUTPUT; EPISODIC MEMORY; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; STRIATAL DOPAMINE; MACAQUE MONKEY; WORKING; MOTOR; FMRI; TIME

These effects have not been confirmed in humans because of the lack of a non-inva- sive, practical in vivo imaging tool with the ability to detect these changes. Following the successful use of ultrasound backscatter spectroscopy (UBS) to monitor in vivo cell death in breast tumors, we aimed to use UBS to assess the neuro- toxicity of the anesthetic sevoflurane (SEVO) in a non -human primate (NHP) model. Sixteen 2- to 7 -day -old rhesus macaques were exposed for 5 h to SEVO. Ultrasound scanning was done with a phased array transducer on a clinical ultrasound scanner operated at 10 MHz. Data consisting of 10 - 15 frames of radiofrequency (RF) echo signals from coronal views of the thalamus were obtained 0.5 and 6.0 h after initiating exposure. The UBS parameter ?effective scat- terer size?(ESS) was estimated by fitting a scattering form factor (FF) model to the FF measured from RF echo sig- nals. The approach involved analyzing the frequency dependence of the measured FF to characterize scattering sources and selecting the FF model based on a chi(2) goodness -of -fit criterion. To assess data quality, a rigorous acceptance criterion based on the analysis of prevalence of diffuse scattering (an assumption in the estimation of ESS) was estab- lished. ESS changes after exposure to SEVO were compared with changes in a control group of five primates for which ultrasound data were acquired at 0 and 10 min (no apoptosis expected). Over the entire data set, the average measured FF at 0.5 and 6.0 h monotonically decreased with frequency, justifying fitting a single FF over the analysis bandwidth. chi(2) values of a (inhomogeneous continuum) Gaussian FF model were one -fifth those of the discrete fluid sphere model, suggesting that a continuum scatterer model better represents ultrasound scattering in the young rhesus brain. After application of the data quality criterion, only 5 of 16 subjects from the apoptotic group and 5 of 5 subjects from the con- trol group fulfilled the acceptance criteria. All subjects in the apoptotic group that passed the acceptance criterion exhibited a significant ESS reduction at 6.0 h. These changes ( - 6.4%, 95% Interquartile Range: -14.3% to -3.3%) were larger than those in the control group ( - 0.8%, 95% Interquartile Range:- 2.0% to 1.5%]). Data with a low prevalence of diffuse scattering corresponded to possibly biased results. Thus, ESS has the potential to detect changes in brain microstructure related to anesthesia -induced apoptosis.

A fully automated synthesis of (-)-[F-18]flubatine as a sterile isotonic solution suitable for clinical use is reported, as well as the first evaluation in nonhuman primates (rhesus macaques). (-)-[F-18]Flubatine was prepared by fluorination of the Boc-protected trimethylammonium iodide precursor with [F-18]fluoride in an automated synthesis module. Subsequent deprotection of the Boc group with 1-M HCl yielded (-)-[F-18]flubatine, which was purified by semi-preparative HPLC. (-)-[F-18]Flubatine was prepared in 25% radiochemical yield (formulated for clinical use at end of synthesis, n=3), >95% radiochemical purity, and specific activity=4647Ci/mmol (171.9GBq/mu mol). Doses met all quality control criteria confirming their suitability for clinical use. Evaluation of (-)-[F-18]flubatine in rhesus macaques was performed with a Concorde MicroPET P4 scanner (Concorde MicroSystems, Knoxville, TN). The brain was imaged for 90min, and data were reconstructed using the 3-D maximum a posteriori algorithm. Image analysis revealed higher uptake and slower washout in the thalamus than those in other areas of the brain and peak uptake at 45min. Injection of 2.5 mu g/kg of nifene at 60min initiated a slow washout of [F-18]flubatine, with about 25% clearance from the thalamus by the end of imaging at 90min.

However, association cortices also receive, albeit weak, direct thalamocortical sensory inputs of unknown function. For example, while information proceeds from primary (SI) to secondary (SII) somatosensory cortex in a serial fashion, both areas are known to receive direct thalamocortical sensory input. The present study examines the potential roles of such parallel input arrangements. The subjects were presented with median nerve somatosensory stimuli with the instruction to respond with the contralateral hand. The locations and time courses of the activated brain areas were first identified with magnetoencephalography (MEG). In a subsequent session, these brain areas were modulated with single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) at 15-210 ms after the somatosensory stimulus while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. TMS pulses at 15-40 ms post-stimulus significantly speeded up reaction times and somatosensory-evoked responses, with largest facilitatory effects when the TMS pulse was given to contralateral SII at about 20 ms. To explain the results, we propose that the early somatosensory-evoked physiological SII activation exerts an SII -> SI influence that facilitates the reciprocal SI -> SII pathway - with TMS to SII we apparently amplified this mechanism. The results suggest that the human brain may utilize parallel inputs to facilitate long-distance cortico-cortical connections, resulting in accelerated processing and speeded reaction times. This arrangement could also allow very early top- down modulation of the bottom-up stream of sensory information. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.

In this work, we acquired five PET scans using a highly selective D2/D3 dopamine antagonist, 18F-fallypride, to track changes in dopamine receptor availability, as measured by the distribution volume ratio (DVR), through the course of DBS in the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST) in a nonhuman primate. Methods: PET scans were performed on a rhesus monkey with unilateral BNST stimulation during periods of baseline, chronic high frequency (130 Hz) and low frequency (50 Hz) DBS stimulation, and during a washout period between stimulation periods. A final scan was performed with the electrode stimulation starting 110 min into the scan. Whole brain parametric images of 18F-fallypride DVR were calculated for each condition to track changes in both striatal and extrastriatal D2/D3 availability. Results: The monkey displayed significant increases in receptor binding throughout the brain during DBS relative to baseline for 130 and 50 Hz, with changes in DVR of: caudate 42%, 51%; putamen 56%, 57%; thalamus 33%,49%; substantia nigra 29%,26%; and prefrontal cortex 28%, 56%, respectively. Washout and post-stimulation scans revealed DVR values close to baseline values. Activating the stimulator midway through the final scan resulted in no statistically significant changes in binding.

Another group of three monkeys was exposed to HgCl2 i.v. for 3 months. Total and inorganic mercury concentrations in occipital pole and thalamus were determined by cold vapor atomic absorption spectroscopy. Selenium concentrations were analyzed by hydride generation atomic absorption spectroscopy, The results indicated an association between concentrations of inorganic mercury and selenium in both occipital pole and thalamus in the MeHg-exposed animals, A linear regression model using concentrations of inorganic mercury (nmol/g wet wt) as independent variable, and selenium concentrations (nmol/g wet wt) as the dependent variable showed significant correlations between the variables in both occipital pole and thalamus (r = 0.85 and r = 0.91, P < 0.0001). The intercept of the regression line was slightly lower (about 2 nmol Se/g wet wt) than the selenium concentrations found in control monkeys (about 3 nmol Se/g wet wt). There was a tendency to a ''hockey stick''-shaped relationship between concentrations of selenium and inorganic mercury in the thalamus of monkeys with ongoing exposure to MeHg. An important role for selenium in the retention of mercury in brain is indicated.",BRAIN; SELENIUM; INORGANIC MERCURY; METHYLMERCURY; MONKEYS; TISSUES; RATS

As iron induces local changes in magnetic susceptibility, its presence can be visualized with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The usual approach, based on iron induced changes inmagnetic relaxation (T2/T2'), is often prone, however, to confounding artifacts and lacks specificity. Here, we propose a new method to quantify and map iron deposits using water diffusion MRI. This method is based on the differential sensitivity of two image acquisition schemes to the local magnetic field gradients induced by iron deposits and their cross-term with gradient pulses used for diffusion encoding. Iron concentration could be imaged and estimated with high accuracy in the brain cortex, the thalamus, the substantia nigra and the globus pallidus of macaques, showing iron distributions in agreement with literature. Additionally, iron maps could clearly show a dramatic increase in iron content upon injection of an UltraSmall Particle Iron Oxide (USPIO) contrast agent, notably in the cortex and the thalamus, reflecting regional differences in blood volume. The method will benefit clinical investigations on the effect of iron deposits in the brain or other organs, as iron deposits are increasingly seen as a biomarker for a wide range of diseases, notably, neurodegenerative diseases in the pre-symptomatic stage. It also has the potential for quantifying variations in blood volume induced by brain activation in fMRI studies using USPIOs. (C) 2014 The Authors.

Central sensory processing uses also rate coding, and motor outputs appear to be primarily encoded by rate. I propose here a simple, efficient structure, converting temporal coding to rate coding by neuronal phase-locked loops (PLL). The simplest form of a PLL includes a phase detector (that is, a neuronal-plausible version of an ideal coincidence detector) and a controllable local oscillator that are connected in a negative feedback loop. The phase detector compares the firing times of the local oscillator and the input and provides an output whose firing rate is monotonically related to the time difference. The output rate is fed back to the local oscillator and forces it to phase-lock to the input. Every temporal interval at the input is associated with a specific pair of output rate and time difference values; the higher the output rate, the further the local oscillator is driven from its intrinsic frequency. Sequences of input intervals, which by definition encode input information, are thus represented by sequences of firing rates at the PLL's output. The most plausible implementation of PLL circuits is by thalamocortical loops in which populations of thalamic relay neurons function as phase detectors that compare the timings of cortical oscillators and sensory signals. The output in this case is encoded by the thalamic population rate. This article presents and analyzes the algorithmic and the implementation levels of the proposed PLL model and describes the implementation of the PLL model to the primate tactile system.",nan; PRIMARY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; AFFERENT FIBER RESPONSES; TACTILE SPATIAL-RESOLUTION; MONKEYS MACACA-MULATTA; GLABROUS SKIN; VISUAL-CORTEX; HUMAN HAND; PATTERN-RECOGNITION; FIRING PATTERNS; BARREL CORTEX

We have examined and quantified in primate prefrontal cortex the subcellular distribution of two isoforms of protein phosphatase-1 (PP1), PP1 alpha and PP1 gamma1, which are components of the signal transduction pathway accessed by the D-1 dopamine receptor. Both PP1 alpha- and PP1 gamma1-labeled puncta are seen in cortex, basal ganglia, hippocampus, and thalamus. Viewed with the electron microscope, both PP1 isoforms are selectively localized to dendritic spines and are found in different percentages of spines; PP1 alpha is present in roughly 70% and PP1 gamma1 in roughly 40% of dendritic spines. Our analysis indicates that three populations of spines are defined by the distribution of these PP1 isoforms: those that contain both PP1 alpha and PP1 gamma1, those that contain only PP1 alpha and those that contain neither. The D-1 receptor is present in a subset of the population that contains both PP1 alpha and PP1 gamma1. The nonhomogeneous distribution of signal transduction proteins in the spines and dendrites of cortical pyramidal cells may help to explain differences in the actions of receptors that nominally use the same signal-transduction pathway.

Responsiveness within the hand region of the second somatosensory area of cortex (SII) was investigated in the marmoset monkey (Callithrix jacchus) in association with cooling-induced, reversible inactivation of the primary somatosensory area, SI. The aims were to determine whether thalamocortical systems in this primate species are organized according to a serial scheme in which tactile information is conveyed from the thalamus to SI and thence to SII as the next hierarchical level of processing and to establish whether primates are fundamentally different, in this respect, from mammals in which tactile information is conveyed in parallel from the thalamus to both SI and SII. 2. Inactivation of the SI hand area was achieved when the temperature at the face of the silver cooling block over this SI region was lowered to less than or equal to 13 degrees C. Inactivation was confirmed by abolition of the SI surface potential evoked by a brief tap stimulus to the hand and by the abolition of responsiveness in single SI neurons located beneath and around the edge of the block. 3. The effect of SI inactivation on SII-evoked potentials was investigated in 20 experiments by simultaneous recording of the SI- and SII-evoked potentials. The SII response was never abolished and was unchanged in the majority (12/20) of experiments. In the remainder, the SII-evoked potentials underwent a reduction in amplitude that was usually <30% but never >50%. 4. Tactile responsiveness was examined quantitatively in 47 individual SII neurons of different functional classes before, during, and after the inactivation of SI. Controlled tactile stimuli consisted of trains of sinusoidal vibration or rectangular pulses delivered to the glabrous or hairy skin of the hand. 5. Thirteen of the 47 SII neurons (28%) were unaffected in their response levels in association with SI inactivation. The remaining 34 SII neurons underwent some reduction in responsiveness, but in only 6% (3/47) was responsiveness abolished by SI inactivation. As the same range of functional classes of tactile neurons were represented among the affected and unaffected SII neurons, there was no evidence for a differential susceptibility among SII tactile neurons to the effect of SI inactivation. 6. Where reductions in amplitude of the SII-evoked potential or in response levels of SII neurons were observed, the effects were not attributable to direct spread of cooling from SI to the SII hand area as there was no cooling-induced prolongation of either the evoked potential or spike waveform in SII, an effect that is known to precede cooling-induced reductions in responsiveness. 7. These lines of evidence indicate that reductions in SII responsiveness in association with SI inactivation may be attributable to a loss of a background facilitatory influence rather than to a blockage of a component of peripheral input that comes over a putative serial path to SII via SI. First, as SI was cooled, there was a progressive increase in latency and time course of the SI responses before their disappearance, but no comparable delay in the SII responses as might be expected if SI were placed earlier than SII in a strict hierarchical scheme of thalamocortical processing. Second, SI inactivation failed to bring about a tightening in the phase-locking of SII responses to vibrotactile stimuli as might have been expected if the inputs to the SII neurons come via both a direct path from the thalamus and an indirect intracortical path via SI. Blockage of the indirect intracortical pathway through SI might be expected to reduce temporal dispersion in the input to SII neurons and result in an improvement in phase-locking in the SII responses to skin vibration. Third, the background activity of some SII neurons was reduced during SI inactivation along with the reduction in their responses to tactile stimulation. If this background activity is endogenous to SII and not generated by afferent drive that comes via SI, it appears that the inactivation removes a source of background facilitation that arises in SI and affects a proportion of SII neurons. 8. In conclusion, the retention of tactile responsiveness in >90% of marmoset SII neurons in association with SI inactivation demonstrates that within this primate species, tactile inputs can reach SII without traversing an indirect, serially organized path through SI. The results establish that in the marmoset monkey, as in nonprimate species, there is a parallel organization of the SI and Sn areas for tactile processing and therefore necessitate a revision of the hypothesis that tactile processing at the thalamocortical level in simian primates is based on a strict serial scheme in which signals are conveyed from the thalamus to SI, and thence to SII. The results indicate that there is no longer justification for the view that there are fundamental differences between simian primates, in general, and other mammals in the organization of thalamocortical systems that supply SI and SII.",nan; SOMATOSENSORY CORTICAL AREA; SOMATIC SENSORY CORTEX; TONGUE-PROTRUSION TASK; COLUMN NUCLEI NEURONS; MACAQUE MONKEYS; SOMATOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; VIBRATORY INFORMATION; NEURAL MECHANISMS; CUNEATE NUCLEUS; SQUIRREL-MONKEY

Neurons in dorsal column nuclei respond primarily to innocuous somatic inputs, but noxious stimulation of pelvic viscera activates gracile neurons. The purpose of this study was to compare effects of thoracic visceral input on cuneothalamic and STT neurons. Stellate ganglia of 17 anesthetized monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were stimulated electrically to activate cardiopulmonary sympathetic afferent fibers. Somatic receptive fields were manipulated with brush, tap, and pinch stimuli. Extracellular discharge rate nias recorded for neurons antidromically activated from ventroposterolateral (VPL) thalamus. Stimulation of the ipsilateral stellate ganglion increased activity of 17 of 35 cuneothalamic neurons and of 1 gracilothalamic neuron with an upper body somatic field. Spinal cord transections showed that cardiopulmonary input to cuneothalamic neurons traveled in ipsilateral dorsal column and probably in dorsolateral funiculus. One of eight gracilothalamic neurons with lower body fields was inhibited by cardiopulmonary input, and none were excited. Stimulation of the ipsilateral stellate ganglion increased activity in 10 of 10 T-3-T-4 STT neurons. Evoked discharge rates, latencies to activation and durations of peristimulus histogram peaks were significantly less for cuneothalamic neurons compared with STT neurons. Furthermore, additional long latency peaks of activity developed in histograms for 6 of 10 STT neurons but never for cuneothalamic neurons. Contralateral cardiopulmonary sympathetic input did not excite cuneothalamic neurons but increased activity of 7 of 10 T-3-T-4 STT neurons. Most cuneothalamic neurons (24 of 31 cells tested) responded primarily to innocuous somatic stimuli, whereas STT neurons responded primarily or solely to noxious pinch of somatic fields. Neurons chat responded to cardiopulmonary input most often had somatic fields located on proximal arm and chest. Results of this study showed that cardiopulmonary input was transmitted in dorsal pathways to cuneate nucleus and then to VPL thalamus and confirmed that STT neurons transmit nociceptive cardiopulmonary input to VPL thalamus. Differences in neuronal responses to noxious stimulation of cardiopulmonary sympathetic afferent fibers suggest that dorsal and ventrolateral pathways to VPL thalamus play different roles in the transmission and integration of nociceptive cardiac information.",nan; DORSAL COLUMN PATHWAY; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; CUNEATE NUCLEUS; LATERAL THALAMUS; URINARY-BLADDER; VISCERAL INPUT; SENSORY INPUTS; MONKEY; RESPONSES; CELLS

In the patients with Huntington's disease, impaired activity of the striatum and its frontal motor projection areas (rostral supplementary motor area, anterior cingulate and premotor cortex) could be demonstrated along with enhanced activity mainly in parietal areas during movement.

To this day, our understanding of the visual system in mammals beyond the few studied animal models remains limited. In the present study, we examined the primary visual cortex of Cetartiodactyls that live on land (sheep, Pere David deer, giraffe); in the sea (bottlenose dolphin, Risso's dolphin, long-finned pilot whale, Cuvier's beaked whale, sperm whale and fin whale); or in an amphibious environment (hippopotamus). We also sampled and studied the visual cortex of the horse (a closely related perissodactyl) and two primates (chimpanzee and pig-tailed macaque) for comparison. Our histochemical and immunohistochemical results indicate that the visual cortex of Cetartiodactyls is characterized by a peculiar organization, structure, and complexity of the cortical column. We noted a general lesser lamination compared to simians, with diminished density, and an apparent simplification of the intra- and extra-columnar connections. The presence and distribution of calcium-binding proteins indicated a notable absence of parvalbumin in water species and a strong reduction of layer 4, usually enlarged in the striated cortex, seemingly replaced by a more diffuse distribution in neighboring layers. Consequently, thalamo-cortical inputs are apparently directed to the higher layers of the column. Computer analyses and statistical evaluation of the data confirmed the results and indicated a substantial correlation between eye placement and cortical structure, with a markedly segregated pattern in cetaceans compared to other mammals. Furthermore, cetacean species showed several types of cortical lamination which may reflect differences in function, possibly related to depth of foraging and consequent progressive disappearance of light, and increased importance of echolocation.",Visual cortex; Comparative neuroanatomy; Cetartiodactyls; Lateralization; Lamination; Cytoarchitecture; BOTTLE-NOSED-DOLPHIN; LOCAL CIRCUIT NEURONS; MONKEY STRIATE CORTEX; CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEINS; GANGLION-CELL TOPOGRAPHY; SPATIAL RESOLVING POWER; TURSIOPS-TRUNCATUS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; NEURAL SYSTEMS; IMMUNOREACTIVE NEURONS

However, equilibrium binding assays alone have not permitted a clear demonstration of the localization of putative Ml, M2, and M3 receptor subtypes in the brain because of the overlapping affinities of virtually all muscarinic antagonists. In the present study, the conditions for selective occupancy of the Ml, M2, and M3 receptor subtypes in the brain of the rhesus monkey were based on the distinct kinetic and equilibrium binding properties of N-[H-3]-methylscopolamine (NMS) at cloned ml-m4 muscarinic receptor subtypes expressed in A9L transfected cells. Quantitatitve autoradiography of the Ml, M2, and M3 muscarinic receptor subytpes in the primate brain was performed according to the following strategy. The Ml (ml) receptor subtype was labeled directly with a non-saturating concentration of [H-3]-pirenzepine. The M2 (m2) subtype was labeled by incubations consisting of short, two minute pulses of [H-3]-NMS after a preincubation with 0.3 muM pirenzepine to occlude ml, m3, and m4 sites. Selective occupancy of the M3 (m3) receptor (subtype) was achieved by pre-incubation with 0.5 nM unlabeled NMS to partially occlude the ml, m2, and m4 sites, equilibrium with 0.5 nM [H-3]-NMS, followed by a 60 minute tracer dissociation in the presence of 1 muM atropine. In vitro autoradiography demonstrated that the Ml receptor subtype was confined to forebrain structures. Ml receptors were prevalent throughout the cerebral cortical mantle, amygdala, hippocampus, and the striatum. Low to background levels of the Ml receptor subtype were measured over the thalamus, hypothalamus, and brainstem. The M2 subtype was widely distributed with elevated densities of binding sites seen over all primary sensory cortical areas, and within discrete thalamic, hypothalamic, and brainstem nuclei. The distribution of the M3 receptor subtype was largely coincident with the pattern of the Ml sites labeled by non-saturating concentrations of [H-3]-pirenzepine with some notable exceptions. Within the cerebral cortical mantle, the M3 receptor exhibited an elevated gradient over the orbitofrontal gyrus and the temporal lobe. Within the striatum, the M3 subtype was elevated over the anterior and dorsal part of the caudate nucleus, while the Ml receptors were most prevalent over the ventromedial sector. Selective labeling of M3 receptors was seen over the medial division of the globus pallidus and within the substantia nigra pars reticulata. In contrast to the pattern of the Ml receptor subtype, M3 receptors were prevalent also over midline nuclei of the hypothalamus. These results demonstrate that the distinct kinetic and equilibrium binding profiles of N-methylscopolamine and pirenzepine for cloned muscarinic receptors provide a viable ligand autoradiographic strategy for mapping the distribution of Ml, M2, and M3 receptors in brain.

In recent studies, we used transneuronal virus tracing techniques to demonstrate that the output of the cerebellum of primates projects via the thalamus not only to its classical motor target, the primary motor cortex, but also to nonmotor cortical areas in the prefrontal and posterior parietal cortex. We found that dentate neurons projecting to different cortical areas originated from localized regions of the nucleus which we termed output channels. To compare the locations of the output channels projecting to different cortical targets, we have created an unfolded map of the dentate. This unfolded map revealed that dentate output channels were segregated into spatially separate motor and nonmotor domains. The output channels in the motor domain exclusively targeted primary motor and premotor areas of the cerebral cortex. These channels were localized in the dorsal portion of the dentate. The output channels in the nonmotor domain projected to prefrontal and posterior parietal cortical areas. The nonmotor domain was confined to the ventral portion of the dentate. In recent studies, we defined a unique molecular marker, monoclonal antibody 8B3. which appears to differentially recognize these two domains. Taken together, our results suggest that dentate output is organized according to the functional capabilities of its cortical targets. This organization provides the dentate nucleus with the anatomical substrate to influence not only the control of movement, but also cognitive, higher-order executive and visuospatial functions.",dentate nucleus; cerebellum; motor; cognitive function; prefrontal cortex; posterior parietal cortex; thalamus; CORTICOPONTINE PROJECTION; TRANSNEURONAL TRANSPORT; CEREBELLAR PROJECTIONS; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; ANATOMICAL EVIDENCE; RHESUS-MONKEY; FRONTAL-LOBE; CORTEX; ORGANIZATION; PRIMATE

A positron emission tomography (PET) study was done to determine if a similar anatomical segregation exists in humans for object and spatial visual working memory. Face working memory demonstrated significant increases in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), relative to location working memory, in fusiform, parahippocampal, inferior frontal, and anterior cingulate cortices, and in right thalamus and midline cerebellum. Location working memory demonstrated significant increases in rCBF relative to face working memory, in superior and inferior parietal cortex, and in the superior frontal sulcus.

Despite several studies exploring the somatosensory system of marmosets, all results have come from anesthetized animals using invasive techniques and postmortem analyses. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility for getting high-quality and reproducible somatosensory mapping in awake marmosets with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We acquired fMRI sequences in four animals, while they received tactile stimulation (via air-puffs), delivered to the face, arm, or leg. We found a topographic body representation with the leg representation in the most medial part, the face representation in the most lateral part, and the arm representation between leg and face representation within areas 3a, 3b, and 1/2. A similar sequence from leg to face from caudal to rostral sites was identified in areas S2 and PV. By generating functional connectivity maps of seeds defined in the primary and second somatosensory regions, we identified two clusters of tactile representation within the posterior and midcingulate cortex. However, unlike humans and macaques, no clear somatotopic maps were observed. At the subcortical level, we found a somatotopic body representation in the thalamus and, for the first time in marmosets, in the putamen. These maps have similar organizations, as those previously found in Old World macaque monkeys and humans, suggesting that these subcortical somatotopic organizations were already established before Old and New World primates diverged. Our results show the first whole brain mapping of somatosensory responses acquired in a noninvasive way in awake marmosets. NEW & NOTEWORTHY We used somatosensory stimulation combined with functional MRI (fMRI) in awake marmosets to reveal the topographic body representation in areas S1, S2, thalamus, and putamen. We showed the existence of a body representation organization within the thalamus and the cingulate cortex by computing functional connectivity maps from seeds defined in S1/S2, using resting-state fMRI data.

Methods: Carbon-11 was introduced into HOMADAM by preparation of N-methyl -2- (2'-amino-4'-hydroxymethylphenylthio)benzylamine followed by alkylation with carbon-11 iodomethane. Binding affinities of HOMADAM and the radiolabeling substrate, N-methyl-2-(2'-amino-4'-hydroxymethylphenylthio)benzylamine, were determined in cDNA transfected cells expressing human SERT, dopamine transporters (DAT) and norepinephrine transporters NET using [H-3]citalopram, [I-125]RTI-55 and [H-3]nisoxetine, respectively. MicroPET brain imaging was performed in monkeys. Arterial plasma metabolites of HOMADAM were analyzed in a rhesus monkey by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Results: HOMADAM displayed high affinity for the SERT (K-i=0.6 nM). N-methyl-2-(2-amino-4-hydroxymethylphenylthio)benzyiamine displayed moderate affinity for the SERT (K-i = 15.11 nM). The affinities of HOMADAM for the DAT and NET were 2000- and 253-fold lower, respectively, than for the SERT. [C-11]HOMADAM was prepared from [C-11]iodomethane in approximately 25% radiochemical yield (decay-corrected to end of bombardment). MicroPET brain imaging studies in monkeys demonstrated that [C-11]HOMADAM uptake was selectively localized in the raidbrain, thalamus, pons, caudate, putamen and medulla. The inidbrain-to-cerebellum, pons-to-cerebellum, thalamus-to-cerebellum and putamen-to-cerebellum ratios at 85 min were 4.2, 2.8, 2.3 and 2.0, respectively. HOMADAM binding achieved quasi-equilibrium at 45 min. Radioactivity in the SERT-rich regions of monkey brain was displaceable with R,S-citalopram. Radioactivity in the DAT-rich regions of monkey brain was not displaceable with the DAT ligand RTI-113. Radioactivity in the SERT-rich regions of monkey brain was displaceable with the R,S-reboxetine, a NET ligand with a high nanomolar affinity for SERT. Arterial plasma metabolites of HOMADAM were analyzed in a rheses monkey by HPLC and displayed a single peak that corresponded to unmetabolized HOMADAM.

However, these subdivisions show no correlation with those established by electrophysiological, immunocytochemical, or neuroanatomical tracer studies. In this work, we studied the connections of the pulvinar nucleus of Cebus monkey with visual areas V1, V2, V4, MT, and PO by means of retrograde fluorescent tracers injected into these areas. Based on the projection zones to cortical visual areas, the visual portion of the pulvinar. of Cebus monkey was subdivided into three subregions: P1, P2, and P3, similar to those described in the macaque (Ungerleider ct al., 1984). In Cebus, P1 includes the centrolateral portion of traditionally defined PI and adjacent portion of FL. P? is located in the dorsal portion of PL and P3 includes the medial portion of FI and extends dorsally into adjacent PL and PM. In addition, eve studied the histology of the pulvinar using multiple criteria, such as cytoarchitecture and myeloarchitecture; histochemistry for cytochrome oxidase, NADPH-diaphorase, and acetylcholinesterase; and immunocytochemistry for two calcium-binding proteins, calbindin and parvalbumin, and for a neurofilament recognized by the SMI-32 antibody. Some of these stains, mainly calbindin, showed additional subdivisions of the Cebus pulvinar, beyond the traditional PI, FL, and PM. Based on this immunohistochemical staining, the border of PI is moved dorsally above the brachium of the superior colliculus and PI can be subdivided in five regions (PIP, PIM, PIC, PIL, and PILS). Regions P1, P2, and P3 defined based on efferent connections with cortical visual areas are not architectonically/neurochemically homogeneous. Rather. they appear to consist of further chemoarchitectonic subdivisions. These distinct histochemical regions might be related to different functional modules of visual processing within one connectional area.",primate; visual system; thalamus; connections; calcium-binding proteins; VISUAL AREA MT; CYTOCHROME-OXIDASE HISTOCHEMISTRY; OLD-WORLD MONKEYS; INFERIOR PULVINAR; MACAQUE MONKEY; VISUOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; ARCHITECTONIC SUBDIVISIONS; CORTICAL PROJECTIONS; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; CALLITHRIX-JACCHUS

The objective of this study was to confirm somatosensory-auditory interaction in Al and to define both its physiological mechanisms and its consequences for auditory information processing. Laminar current source density and multiunit activity sampled during multielectrode penetrations of primary auditory area Al in awake macaques revealed clear somatosensory-auditory interactions, with a novel mechanism: somatosensory inputs appear to reset the phase of ongoing neuronal oscillations, so that accompanying auditory inputs arrive during an ideal, high-excitability phase, and produce amplified neuronal responses. In contrast, responses to auditory inputs arriving during the opposing low-excitability phase tend to be suppressed. Our findings underscore the instrumental role of neuronal oscillations in cortical operations. The timing and laminar profile of the multisensory interactions in Al indicate that nonspecific thalamic systems may play a key role in the effect.",nan; SOURCE-DENSITY ANALYSIS; MACAQUE MONKEYS; ASSOCIATION CORTEX; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; LAMINAR PROFILE; LOW-LEVEL; CONNECTIONS; RESPONSES; INTEGRATION; DYNAMICS

The results indicate that the orbital and medial networks connect to different striatal regions. The ventromedial striatum (the medial caudate nucleus, accumbens nucleus, and ventral putamen) receives input predominantly from the medial PFC (mPFC) and orbital areas 12o, Iai, and 13a, which constitute the medial network. More specifically, caudal medial areas 32, 25, and 14r project to the medial edge of the caudate nucleus, accumbens nucleus, and ventromedial putamen, whereas rostral areas 10o, 10m, and 11m are restricted to the medial edge of the caudate. Projections from orbital areas 12o, 13a, and Iai extend more laterally into the lateral accumbens and the ventral putamen. Area 24 gives rise to a divided pattern of projections, including fibers to the ventromedial striatum, apparently from area 24b, and fibers to the dorsolateral striatum, apparently from area 24c. Other areas of orbital cortex (11l, 12m, 12l, 13m, 13l, Ial, and Iam) that constitute the orbital network project primarily to the central part of the rostral striatum. This region includes the central and lateral parts of the caudate nucleus, and the ventromedial putamen, on either side of the internal capsule. The results support the subdivision of the orbital and medial PFC into medial and orbital networks and suggest that the prefrontostriatal projections reflect the functional organization of the PFC rather than topographic location.

Surgical interventions aimed at increasing basal ganglia-thalamic outflow to the cortex, such as electrical stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus with chronically implanted electrodes, have been shown to be effective in improving the clinical symptoms of Parkiuson's disease. This study examined changes in cortical activity, as reflected in the CNV, associated with bilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation in Parkinson's disease, The CNV was recorded from 10 patients with Parkinson's disease when on and off bilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation, and was compared with the CNV of 10 healthy control subjects. Without subthalamic nucleus stimulation, Parkinson's disease patients showed reduced CNV amplitudes over the frontal and frontocentral regions compared with control subjects. With bilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation, however, CNV amplitudes over the frontal and frontocentral regions were significantly increased. Results therefore suggest that impaired cortical functioning in Parkinson's disease, particularly within the frontal and premotor areas, is improved by subthalamic nucleus stimulation.",Parkinson's disease; subthalamic nucleus stimulation; contingent negative variation; MOVEMENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA; CEREBRAL BLOOD-FLOW; HIGH-FREQUENCY STIMULATION; BASAL GANGLIA; RHESUS-MONKEY; L-DOPA; ACTIVATION; PET; APOMORPHINE

This insectivore shows one of the lowest size indices among mammals for both the cerebellar nuclei and the neocortex. Almost all cerebellodience-phalic target areas found in the tenrec have been described in other mammals. The intensity and extent of particular projections, however, vary considerably in the tenrec compared with the other mammals investigated so far. The most remarkable finding may be the tenrec's cerebellar projection to the nucleus ventralis medialis. This projection is the most prominent cerebellothalamic projection and originates in predominantly the lateral portion of the cerebellar nuclear complex. The projection to the caudolateral portion of the ventralis anterior complex (VAC) is located immediately rostral to the area receiving ascending somatosensory afferents and appears to originate, in particular, from the intermediate cerebellar nuclear complex. Another cerebellothalamic focus of terminations lies in the paralamellar region of the VAC, whereas the proper intralaminar nuclei, at best, receive a sparse cerebellar input. A faint-to-moderate projection, on the other hand, has been traced consistently to the ventral portion of the lateralis posterior-pulvinar complex and the adjacent dorsal geniculate nucleus. In addition, there are prominent cerebellosubthalamic projections to the zona incerta and the ventral geniculate nucleus. The latter projection is confined mainly to the ventralmost subdivision, which has been shown previously to receive ascending somatosensory, but not retinal, afferents. With the exception of the nucleus ventralis medialis, the projections were essentially confined to the contralateral side. J. Comp. Neurol. 402:313-326, 1998.

They were distributed bilaterally in the periarcuate cortex around the junction of the spur and the arcuate sulcus. This vestibular-projecting area corresponded to the periarcuate area where retrogradely-labeled corticovestibular neurons were distributed after the injection of a tracer into the vestibular nuclei.

Using FDG PET data and Structural Equation Modeling, a formal depression model was created to explicitly test current theories of limbic-cortical dysfunction in MDD and to characterize at the path level potential sources of baseline variability reported in this patient population. A 7-region model consisting of lateral prefrontal cortex (latF9), anterior thalamus (aTh), anterior cingulate (Cg24), subgenual cingulate (Cg25), orbital frontal cortex (OF711), hippocampus (Hc), and medial frontal cortex (mF10) was tested in scans of 119 depressed patients and 42 healthy control subjects acquired during three separate studies at two different institutions. A single model, based on previous theory and supported by anatomical connectivity literature, was stable for the three groups of depressed patients. Within the context of this model, path differences among groups as a function of treatment response characteristics were also identified. First, limbic-cortical connections (latF9-Cg25-OF11-Hc) differentiated drug treatment responders from nonresponders. Second, nonresponders showed additional abnormalities in limbic-subcortical pathways (aTh-Cg24-Cg25-OF11-Hc). Lastly, more limited limbic-cortical (Hc-latF9) and cortical-cortical (OF11-mF10) path differences differentiated responders to cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) from responders to pharmacotherapy. We conclude that the creation of such models is a first step toward full characterization of the depression phenotype at the neural systems level, with implications for the future development of brain-based algorithms to determine optimal treatment selection for individual patients.

Using blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging, we sought to visualize functional activation of these regions in 12 normal volunteers as they anticipated and responded for monetary incentives. Both individual and group analyses of time-series data revealed significant activation of striatal and mesial forebrain structures (including insula, caudate, putamen, and mesial prefrontal cortex) during trials involving both monetary rewards and punishments. In addition to these areas, during trials involving punishment, group analysis revealed activation foci in the anterior cingulate and thalamus. These results corroborate comparative studies which implicate striatal and mesial forebrain circuitry in the elaboration of incentive-driven behavior.

Recordings in primates during instructed-delay reaching tasks have shown that different types of traveling waves of oscillatory activity are associated with episodes of beta oscillations in motor cortex during movement preparation. We propose here a simple model of motor cortex based on local excitatory-inhibitory neuronal populations coupled by long-range excitation, where additionally inputs to the motor cortex from other neural structures are represented by stochastic inputs on the different model populations. We show that the model accurately reproduces the statistics of recording data when these external inputs are correlated on a short time scale (25 ms) and have two different components, one that targets the motor cortex locally and another one that targets it in a global and synchronized way. The model reproduces the distribution of beta burst durations, the proportion of the different observed wave types, and wave speeds, which we show not to be linked to axonal propagation speed. When the long-range connectivity or the local input targets are anisotropic, traveling waves are found to preferentially propagate along the axis where connectivity decays the fastest. Different from previously proposed mechanistic explanations, the model suggests that traveling waves in motor cortex are the reflection of the dephasing by external inputs, putatively of thalamic origin, of an oscillatory activity that would otherwise be spatially synchronized by recurrent connectivity.",oscillations; waves; motor cortex; modeling; Rhesus macaque; FAST NETWORK OSCILLATIONS; INTRINSIC CONNECTIONS; SENSORIMOTOR-CORTEX; DYNAMICS; RHYTHMS; MONKEY; ORGANIZATION; INHIBITION; MECHANISMS; FREQUENCY

The aspects of motor performance which are most severely affected are the chronology, the time course and the distribution of the activatory inputs to the muscles. The cerebellar control of motor synergies partly depends on the intrinsic organization of the cerebellar cortex, but interconnections between the cerebellum and the cortex, as well as the organization of the cerebello-spinal outputs are also involved. All these elements take part in different ways in the various aspects of motor synergy control. Depending on the type of sensory signals involved in the triggering of co-ordinations, different cortico-cerebello-cortical connections take part in their programming. Those synergies wich are initiated by external sensory signals are triggered by inputs from the dentate and interposed nuclei and transmitted to parietal associative areas 5 and 7. The programming of the synergies induced by internal signals or motivational states involves projections from the dentate nucleus to prefrontal area 9 as well as to the supplementary motor (SMA) and premotor (PM) areas. The distribution of the cerebellar outputs to the muscles participating in motor synergies depends on the organization of the cerebellar circuits projecting to PM and M1 neurones at the origin of the descending pathways. The fastigial and dentate nuclei give off projections to the PM whereby they activate both axial and proximal muscles via bilateral reticulo-spinal pathways, and these nuclei are therefore responsible for synergies which provide for the necessary postural ajustments when limb movements are performed. When voluntary movements are to be performed, the cerebellar efferents from the three cerebellar nuclei to the motor cortex (M1) are able to trigger all the necessary synergies. Since the motor cortex can be subdivided into several representation areas dealing with elementary unidirectional movements performed by a single joint, activating the requisite co-ordinations requires particular patterns of cerebello-thalamo-cortical activation. With these networks, which can be said to constitute the morphological basis of motor synergies, several body representation cortical areas can be activated simultaneously. These networks seem to be partly set up before birth ; but they may also be shaped during the early stages of life. They are still adaptable during adult-hood, and they can undergo synaptic and functional changes in response to the sensory constraints imposed by the environment.",nan; DORSAL COLUMN NUCLEI; RHESUS-MONKEY; VENTROLATERAL NUCLEUS; THALAMOCORTICAL FIBERS; CEREBRAL PROJECTIONS; FIELD POTENTIALS; DENTATE NEURONS; CAT THALAMUS; CORTEX; MOVEMENTS

Here we investigate whether the functional organization of the voluntary motor system differs between PD patients with and without resting tremor, and whether these differences relate to the cerebral circuit producing tremor. We compared 18 PD patients with marked tremor, 20 PD patients without tremor, and 19 healthy controls. Subjects performed a controlled motor imagery task during fMRI scanning. We quantified imagery-related cerebral activity by contrasting imagery of biomechanically difficult and easy movements. Tremor-related activity was identified by relating cerebral activity to fluctuations in tremor amplitude, using electromyography during scanning. PD patients with tremor had better behavioral performance than PD patients without tremor. Furthermore, tremulous PD patients showed increased imagery-related activity in somatosensory area 3a, as compared with both healthy controls and to nontremor PD patients. This effect was independent from tremor-related activity, which was localized to the motor cortex, cerebellum, and thalamic ventral intermediate nucleus (VIM). The VIM, with known projections to area 3a, was unique in showing both tremor- and imagery-related responses. We conclude that parkinsonian tremor influences motor imagery by modulating central somatosensory processing through the VIM. This mechanism may explain clinical differences between PD patients with and without tremor. Hum Brain Mapp, 2012.

Data are entered into the database by drawing injection and label sites from a particular tracer study directly onto canonical representations of the neuroanatomical structures of interest, along with providing descriptive text information. Searches may then be performed on the data by querying the database graphically, for example by specifying a region of interest within the brain for which connectivity information is desired, or via text information, such as keywords describing a particular brain region, or an author name or reference. Analyses may also be performed by accumulating data across multiple studies and displaying a colour-coded map that graphically represents the total evidence for connectivity between regions. Thus, data may be studied and compared free of areal boundaries (which often vary from one laboratory to the next), and instead with respect to standard landmarks, such as the position relative to well-known neuroanatomical substrates or stereotaxic coordinates. If desired, areal boundaries may also be defined by the user to facilitate the interpretation of results. We demonstrate the application of the database to the analysis of pulvinar-cortical connections in the macaque monkey, for which the results of over 120 neuroanatomical experiments were entered into the database.

These areas occupy the lateral and suprasylvian gyri, from the cingulate sulcus (medially) to the suprasylvian sulcus (laterally) and lie between visual areas 18 and 21 (posteriorly) and the somatosensory areas (anteriorly). Within both areas a coarse representation of the visual field was found and within PPr there was also a representation of the body. Each representation mirrors those within neighboring areas. Cytoarchitectonic and myeloarchitectonic fields within this cortical region did not correspond in any simple way to the physiological representations. The architectonic differences correlate to differential callosal connectivity, with predominant connectivity corresponding to the upper hemifield/head representations. PPr and PPc receive thalamic projections from a different, but overlapping, complement of thalamic nuclei. The superimposition of somatic and visual maps in PPr might relate to the probable role of this area in transforming retinal-centered to body-centered spatial coordinates. The organization of the parietal areas in the ferret resembles that of the flying fox and might unveil a common organizational plan from which the primate posterior parietal cortex evolved.",nan; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; ADJACENT THALAMIC NUCLEI; CAT SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; VISUAL AREAS; MACAQUE MONKEY; RHESUS-MONKEY; CORTICOCORTICAL CONNECTIONS; AFFERENT CONNECTIONS; CALLOSAL CONNECTIONS; EXTRASTRIATE AREAS

We have addressed this issue by examining the topography of developing projections to area 17 in the cat. At different postnatal ages, paired injections of the retrograde tracers diamidino yellow and fast blue were made in area 17. Interinjection separations were carefully controlled and the spatial distribution of the two populations of labelled neurones investigated. Projections to the striate cortex from the lateral geniculate nucleus, area 18, as well as connections intrinsic to area 17 were analysed quantitatively with a graphic method that uses a two-dimensional model of the projection. This allows two parameters of the projection to be calculated: the divergence (the spatial extent of area 17 contacted by an infinitely small region of an afferent structure) and the convergence (the extent of an afferent structure that projects to an infinitely small region of area 17). During postnatal development, the bulk of the connections making up the geniculostriate and corticocortical pathways showed no Variation either in their convergence and divergence. However, the projection of area 18 to area 17 and the intrinsic area 17 connections (but not the geniculostriate projection) in the 3-15-day-old kittens were each found to contain a small subpopulation of widely scattered neurones with widespread axonal trajectories. These results, showing that many initially formed connections display a high degree of topographical order, are discussed in terms of the control mechanisms specifying axonal trajectories during development.

This report focuses on STT input to the ventral posterior lateral nucleus (VPL) and the subjacent ventral posterior inferior nucleus (VPI), where prior anterograde tracing studies identified scattered STT terminal bursts and a dense terminal field, respectively. In cases with small or medium-sized injections in VPL, labeled STT cells were located almost entirely in lamina V (in spinal segments consistent with the mediolateral VPL topography); few cells were labeled in lamina 1 (< 8%) and essentially none in lamina VII. Large and very large injections in VPL produced marked increases in labeling in lamina I, associated first with spread into VPI and next into the posterior part of the ventral medial nucleus (VMpo), and abundant labeling in lamina VII, associated with spread into the ventral lateral (VL) nucleus. Small injections restricted to VPI labeled many STT cells in laminae I and V with an anteroposterior topography. These observations indicate that VPL receives STT input almost entirely from lamina V neurons, whereas VPI receives STT input from both laminae I and V cells, with two different topographic organizations. Together with the preceding observation that STT input to VMpo originates almost entirely from lamina 1, these findings provide strong evidence that the primate STT consists of anatomically and functionally differentiable components.",sensorimotor; spinothalamic; somatosensory; integration; pain; LAMINA-I TERMINATIONS; DORSAL-HORN NEURONS; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; LATERAL THALAMUS; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; PARASYLVIAN CORTEX; TRACT PROJECTIONS; MOTOR CORTEX; HUMAN INSULA; SPINAL-CORD

The neurons receiving inhibitory input from the motor, premotor and supplementary motor areas (Motor-related cortical areas) were located in the lateral part of the SNr, whereas those with input from the medial, dorsal and orbital areas of the prefrontal cortex (PFmdo) were frequently found in the rostro-medial part of this nucleus. SNr neurons with inhibitory input from the ventral periprincipal area (PSv) were mainly distributed in the intermedio-lateral portion, with some degree of overlap with input from other cortical areas. The distribution of the excitatory input was almost similar to that of inhibitory one, but the excitatory input from the PSv was much stronger than that from the PFmdo. Some SNr neurons receiving cortical input were proved to project to the thalamus. Our results support the existence of several parallel organization of the cortico-basal ganglia loop circuits [G.E. Alexander, M.R. DeLong, P.L. Strick, Parallel organization of functionally segregated circuits linking basal ganglia and cortex, Arm. Rev.

The regional distribution patterns of [C-11](+)3-MPB and [C-11]4-MPB at 60-91 min postinjection were almost identical: highest in the striatum and occipital cortex; intermediate in the temporal and frontal cortices, cingulate gyrus, hippocampus, and thalamus; lower in the pens; and lowest in the cerebellum. The uptake of [C-11]( +)3-MPB in all regions was higher and the dynamic range of regional uptake differences of [C-11](+)3-MPB was better than those of [C-11]4-MPB. The levels of [C-11](-)3-MPB were much lower in all regions of the brain than [C-11](+)3-MPB and [C-11]4-MPB. Administration of scopolamine, a muscarinic cholinergic antagonist, at a dose of 50 mug/kg reduced the radioactivity of [C-11](+)3-MPB and [11C]4-MPB in all regions except the cerebellum. Time-activity curves of [C-11](+)3-MPB peaked in all regions, while these of [C-11]4-MPB showed gradual increases with time in all regions except the thalamus, pens, and cerebellum. Two graphical analyses (Logan plot and Patlak plot) with plasma radioactivity as an input function into the brain were applied to evaluate receptor binding in vivo. [C-11](+)3-MPB showed linear regression curves on Logan plot analysis and nonlinear curves on Patlak plot in all regions, suggesting that [C-11](+)3-MPB bound reversibly to the muscarinic receptors. The in vivo binding parameters as well as uptake at 60-91 min postinjection of [C-11](+)3-MPB were consistent with muscarinic receptor density in the brain as reported in vitro.

Because the reactivation of deprived hand cortex by the face inputs could depend on axonal connections across the hand-face border, we determined the extent of such connections in New World marmosets, owl monkeys, and squirrel monkeys. Small injections of anatomic tracers were placed in the hand or the face representations after these representations were identified by microelectrode recordings. The positions of retrogradely labeled neurons were plotted in processed brain sections cut parallel to the brain surface, and their locations were related to anatomic isomorphs of the hand and face representations revealed in adjacent brain sections stained for myelin. In these sections, the hand-face border was clearly visualized as a myelin-poor septum. The intrinsic connections of area 3b labeled by injections in either the hand or face representations were almost completely confined to their respective representation, and very few neurons projected across the border. In addition, neurons in the somatosensory thalamus labeled by injections in either face or hand representations were confined to either VPM, representing the face, or the hand subnucleus of VPL. Thus the reactivation of hand cortex by face stimulation does not depend on a previously existing network of intrinsic cortical connections across the hand-face border, or mismatched thalamocortical projections.",somatosensory cortex; plasticity; ventroposterior nucleus; primate; SOMATOSENSORY CORTICAL AREAS; MACAQUE MONKEYS; SQUIRREL-MONKEYS; VISUAL-CORTEX; ADULT MONKEYS; TOPOGRAPHIC REORGANIZATION; FUNCTIONAL REORGANIZATION; VENTROPOSTERIOR NUCLEUS; STRIATE CORTEX; THALAMUS

In the first experiment, lamina I STT neurons in macaque monkeys were double-labeled for calbindin and for retrogradely transported WGA* HRP following large (n = 2) or small (n = 1) injections that included the posterior thalamus. Most, but not all (78%) of the contralateral retrogradely labeled lamina I STT cells were positive for calbindin. Calbindin-immunoreactivity was not selectively associated with any particular anatomical type of lamina I STT cell; 82% of the fusiform cells, 78% of the pyramidal cells and 67% of the multipolar cells were double-labeled. In the second experiment, oblique transverse sections from upper cervical spinal segments of three macaque monkeys, one squirrel monkey and five humans were stained for calbindin-immunoreactivity. In each case, a distinct bundle of fibers was densely stained in the middle of the lateral funiculus. This matches the location of anterogradely labeled ascending lamina I axons observed in prior work in cats and monkeys, and it matches the location of the classically described 'lateral spinothalamic tract' in humans. This bundle had variable shape across cases, an observation that might have clinical significance. These findings support the view that lamina I STT neurons are involved in spinal cordotomies that reduce pain, temperature and itch sensations.

In order to begin to understand the cellular interactions that are important in cortical target selection by thalamic axons, we have examined the morphology of axons from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) as they navigate their way to the primary visual cortex. The morphology of geniculocortical axons was revealed by placing the lipophilic tracer Dil into the LGN of paraformaldehyde-fixed brains from fetal and neonatal cats between embryonic day 26 (E26; gestation is 65 d) and postnatal day 7 (P7). This morphological approach has led to three major observations. (1) As LGN axons grow within the intermediate zone of the telencephalon toward future visual cortex (E30-40), many give off distinct interstitial axon collaterals that penetrate the subplate of nonvisual cortical areas. These collaterals are transient and are not seen postnatally. (2) There is a prolonged period during which LGN axons are restricted to the visual subplate prior to their ingrowth into the cortical plate; the first LGN axons arrive within visual subplate by E36 but are not detected in layer 6 of visual cortex until about E50. (3) Within the visual subplate, LGN axons extend widespread terminal branches. This represents a marked change in their morphology from the simple growth cones present earlier as LGN axons navigate en route to visual cortex. The presence of interstitial collaterals suggests that there may be ongoing interactions between LGN axons and subplate neurons along the entire intracortical route traversed by the axons. From the extensive branching of LGN axons within the visual subplate during the waiting period, it appears that they are not simply ''waiting.'' Rather, LGN axons may participate in dynamic cellular interactions within the subplate long before they contact their ultimate target neurons in layer 4. These observations confirm the existence of a prolonged waiting period in the development of thalamocortical connections and provide important morphological evidence in support of the previous suggestion that interactions between thalamic axons and subplate neurons are necessary for cortical target selection.",nan; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; CATS VISUAL-CORTEX; GROWTH CONE MORPHOLOGY; INDIVIDUAL X-CELL; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; PRENATAL DEVELOPMENT; CORTICAL PROJECTIONS; SUBPLATE NEURONS; PIONEER NEURONS; MACAQUE MONKEY

Transcranial passive cavitation detection (PCD) provides methodology for monitoring the treatment in real time, but the skull effects remain a major challenge for its translation to the clinic. In this study, we investigated the sensitivity, reliability, and limitations of PCD through primate (macaque and human) skulls in vitro. The results were further correlated with the in vivo macaque studies including the transcranial PCD calibration and real-time monitoring of blood-brain barrier (BBB) opening, with magnetic resonance imaging assessing the opening and safety. The stable cavitation doses using harmonics (SCDh) and ultraharmonics (SCDu), the inertial cavitation dose (ICD), and the cavitation SNR were quantified based on the PCD signals. Results showed that through the macaque skull, the pressure threshold for detecting the SCDh remained the same as without the skull in place, whereas it increased for the SCDu and ICD; through the human skull, it increased for all cavitation doses. The transcranial PCD was found to be reliable both in vitro and in vivo when the transcranial cavitation SNR exceeded the 1-dB detection limit through the in vitro macaque (attenuation: 4.92 dB/mm) and human (attenuation: 7.33 dB/mm) skull. In addition, using long pulses enabled reliable PCD monitoring and facilitate BBB opening at low pressures. The in vivo results showed that the SCDh became detectable at pressures as low as 100 kPa; the ICD became detectable at 250 kPa, although it could occur at lower pressures; and the SCDu became detectable at 700 kPa and was less reliable at lower pressures. Real-time monitoring of PCD was further implemented during BBB opening, with successful and safe opening achieved at 250 to 600 kPa in both the thalamus and the putamen. In conclusion, this study shows that transcranial PCD in macaques in vitro and in vivo, and in humans in vitro, is reliable by improving the cavitation SNR beyond the 1-dB detection limit.",nan; ULTRASOUND CONTRAST AGENTS; FOCUSED-ULTRASOUND; INERTIAL CAVITATION; HUMAN SKULL; DRUG-DELIVERY; IN-VITRO; MICROBUBBLES; DISRUPTION; THERAPY; THROMBOLYSIS

Design: Functional and structural neuroimaging using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging. Setting: University medical center research facility. Patients: Three patients with complete homonymous hemianopia after acute infarction of the right posterior cerebral artery. Main Outcome Measures: Anatomical location of activated structures during horizontal optokinetic stimulation and T-2-weighted anatomical magnetic resonance imaging. Results: Occipitotemporal cortical areas (Brodmann areas 39 and 40) were the only activated cortical structures that showed statistically significant (P < .01) activation on the affected hemisphere. Of the subcortical areas, activation of thalamic nuclei appeared to be missing on the affected side, whereas the basal ganglia (putamen, globus pallidus, and caudate nucleus) were bilaterally activated. Conclusions: Bilateral activation of the basal ganglia confirms the concept of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical motor loop and of the efference copy of oculomotor pathways from each hemisphere. Our findings suggest 2 possible explanations for the activation of occipitotemporal areas (the human homolog of middle temporal/medial superior temporal areas) on the infarcted hemisphere: involvement of direct extrastriatal visual pathways or interhemispheric callosal connections between right and left middle temporal/medial superior temporal areas.",nan; HUMAN BRAIN ACTIVATION; MACAQUE MONKEY; CORTICAL CONTROL; CORTEX; SACCADES; ORGANIZATION; PERCEPTION; RESPONSES; NEURONS; PET

Behav. Brain Res. 20, 249-261, 1986) indicated that ventromedial prefrontal cortex, which receives thalamic projections from the limbo-diencephalic system, is critical for visual recognition; whereas the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, which receives no such thalamic projections, makes little or no contribution to this type of memory. In the present study, we examined the role in recognition of another prefrontal area outside the thalamic projection zone of the limbo-diencephalic system, namely, the inferior prefrontal convexity. In the first experiment, monkeys with lesions of this cortex (Group IC) were found to be impaired in relearning delayed nonmatching-to-sample (DNMS), but not on the subsequent DNMS performance test in which memory demands were greatly increased. In a second experiment, monkeys with combined lesions of the inferior and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Group LAT) were also found to be impaired in relearning DNMS, but in this case they were impaired, in addition, on the subsequent performance test. Neither group (IC or LAT) showed retardation in acquiring visual discrimination habits. Analysis of the DNMS behavior of both groups suggested that their deficits on this task were due not to a loss in recognition memory, but to various forms of perseverative interference. The results support the view that the inferior prefrontal convexity, like the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, lies outside the limbo-diencephalic memory system not only anatomically but also functionally.",nan; MEDIAL THALAMIC LESIONS; RHESUS-MONKEY; FRONTAL-LOBE; MEMORY; IMPAIRMENT; AMYGDALA; NUCLEUS; CORTEX; PROJECTIONS

The aim of this study was to determine whether the existence of this projection could be confirmed unambiguously using electrophysiological methods and, if so, to determine the response characteristics of primate spinohypothalamic tract (SHT) neurons. Fifteen neurons in the lumbar enlargement of macaque monkeys were antidromically activated using low-amplitude current pulses in the contralateral hypothalamus. The points at which antidromic activation thresholds were lowest were found in the supraoptic decussation (n = 13) or in the medial hypothalamus (n = 2). Recording points were located in the superficial dorsal horn (n = 1), deep dorsal horn (n = 10), and intermediate zone (n = 4). Each of the 12 examined neurons had cutaneous receptive fields on the ipsilateral hindlimb. All neurons responded exclusively or preferentially to noxious stimuli, suggesting that the transmission of nociceptive information is an important role of primate SHT axons. Twelve SHT neurons were also antidromically activated from the thalamus. Tn all cases, the antidromic latency from the thalamus was shorter than that from the hypothalamus, suggesting that the axons pass through the thalamus then enter the hypothalamus. These results confirm the existence of a SHT in primates and suggest that this projection may contribute to the production of autonomic, neuroendocrine, and emotional responses to noxious stimuli in primates, possibly including humans.",nan; CERVICAL ENLARGEMENT; ANTEROGRADE TRANSPORT; SPINAL-CORD; RATS; RESPONSES; ORIGIN; CELLS; STIMULATION; PATHWAYS; SYSTEM

Characterization in the primate brain,"The 5-HT(1B) receptor has been implicated in several psychiatric disorders and is a potential pharmacological target in the treatment of depression. Here we report the synthesis of a novel PET radioligand, [(11)C]AZ10419369 (5-methyl-8-(4-methyl-piperazin-1-yl)-4-oxo-4H-chromene-2-carboxylic acid (4-morpholin-4-yl-phenyl)-amide), for in vivo visualization of 5-HT1B receptors in the brains of macaques and humans subjects. [(11)C]AZ10419369 was prepared by N-methylation of (8-(1-piperazinyl)5- methylchrom-2-en-4-one-2-(4-morpholinophenyl) carboxamide, using carbon-11 methyl triflate. Regional brain uptake patterns of [(11)C]AZ10419369 were characterized by PET measurements in two macaques and a preliminary study in two human subjects. In addition, AZ10419369 was prepared in tritium labeled form for in vitro autoradiography studies in macaque brain tissue sections. The radiochemical purity of [(11)C]AZ10419369 was >99% and specific radioactivity was >3600 Ci/ mmol. After iv injection of [(11)C]AZ10419369, 3-4% was in brain after 7.5 min. The regional brain distribution of radioactivity was similar in humans and macaques showing the highest uptake of radioactivity in the occipital cortex and the basal ganglia, in accord with autoradiographic studies performed using [(3)H]AZ10419369. Uptake was moderate in the temporal and frontal cortical regions, lower in the thalamus and lowest in the cerebellum. In macaques pre-treated with the selective 5-HT(1B) receptor antagonist, AR-A000002, binding was reduced in a dose-dependent manner, consistent with specific binding to 5-HT(1B) receptors. These data support [11C] AZ10419369 as a suitable radioligand for labeling 5-HT(1B) receptors in the primate brain. This radioligand may be useful in future studies evaluating drug-induced receptor occupancy and measurement of brain 5-HT1B receptor levels in patients with psychiatric disorders.

In macaques and cats, for example, preferred orientations of neurons are organized in a specific pattern, where cells with similar selectivity are clustered in iso-orientation domains. However, the map is not always continuous, and there are pinwheel-like singularities around which all orientations are arranged in an orderly fashion. Although subject of intense investigation for half a century now, it is still not entirely clear how these maps emerge and what function they might serve. Here, we suggest a new model of orientation selectivity that combines the geometry and statistics of clustered thalamocortical afferents to explain the emergence of orientation maps. We show that the model can generate spatial patterns of orientation selectivity closely resembling the maps found in cats or monkeys. Without any additional assumptions, we further show that the pattern of ocular dominance columns is inherently connected to the spatial pattern of orientation.",Orientation selectivity; Orientation map; Columnar structure; Random connectivity; Primary visual cortex; OCULAR-DOMINANCE COLUMNS; MONKEY STRIATE CORTEX; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE; GENICULOCORTICAL AFFERENTS; ANATOMICAL DEMONSTRATION; ORDERED ARRANGEMENT; CALLITHRIX-JACCHUS; PREFERENCE MAPS

In neocortex and other laminated structures, a simplified, one-dimensional CSD analysis can be computed by differentiation of voltages sampled at discrete points in a linear array. One-dimensional CSD analysis is a practical and accurate method for defining both regional activity patterns and neural generators of surface-recorded evoked and event-related potentials. In computing the CSD, common practices of differentiating across spatial grids of 200 mum or more and use of spatial smoothing routines help to reduce noise, but severely limit the spatial resolution available to the analysis. High-resolution CSD procedures (i.e., 3 point differentiation using a spatial grid of 100 mum or less) are more suited to identification of processes within individual cortical laminae or sublaminae, but can magnify the contributions of computational artifacts. Despite the inclusion of independent indices of cellular activity (e.g., multiunit activity), both high- and low-resolution analyses may indicate current source and sink configurations for which there is more than one plausible physiological interpretation. In the present study we examined the resolving capacity and pitfalls of common CSD procedures using simulated ensembles of current dipoles. These were positioned and oriented to model the depolarization of lamina 4C stellate cells and thalamocortical afferents in macaque striate cortex. Empirically, the surface N40 appears in association with a CSD configuration which includes current sinks within the thalamorecipient (stellate) subdivisions of lamina 4C and a large current source extending considerably below 4C. Dipole ensemble contributions to the CSD profile were computed and compared to physiological data from this region. Small asymmetries in activation of model stellate laminae were sufficient to produce substantial open field contributions. However, the best fit with empirical CSD profile was found when the simulation included contributions from thalamocortical axons, along with both open and closed field contributions from dual stellate cell sublaminae. High-resolution CSD profiles were shown to be interpretable when computational artifacts characteristic of closed and open fields were identified using a series of differentiation grids.",CURRENT SOURCE DENSITY; VISUAL EVOKED POTENTIALS; STRIATE CORTEX; DIPOLE MODELS; MONKEY; FIELD POTENTIALS; ANURAN CEREBELLUM; ALERT MONKEY; CORTEX; CONDUCTIVITY; CAT; GENERATORS; MACAQUE; VEP

Selectivity could arise from enhancement of the cell's response by preferred stimuli, suppression by nonoptimal stimuli, or both. Here, we report that the majority of V1 neurons do not only elevate their activity in response to preferred stimuli, but their firing rates are also suppressed by nonoptimal stimuli. The magnitude of suppression is similar to that of enhancement. There is a tendency for net response suppression to peak at orientations near orthogonal to the optimal for the cell, but cases where suppression peaks at oblique orientations are observed as well. Interestingly, selectivity and suppression correlate in V1: orientation and spatial frequency selectivity are higher for neurons that are suppressed by nonoptimal stimuli than for cells that are not. This finding is consistent with the idea that suppression plays an important role in the generation of sharp cortical selectivity. We show that nonlinear suppression is required to account for the data. However, the precise structure of the neural circuitry generating the suppressive signal remains unresolved.

What is the spatial scale of sleep rhythms? To answer this question, we adapted deep learning algorithms initially developed for detecting earthquakes and gravitational waves in high-noise settings for analysis of neural recordings in sleep. We then studied sleep spindles in non-human primate electrocorticography (ECoG), human electroencephalogram (EEG), and clinical intracranial electroencephalogram (iEEG) recordings in the human. Within each recording type, we find widespread spindles occur much more frequently than previously reported. We then analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns of these large-scale, multi-area spindles and, in the EEG recordings, how spindle patterns change following a visual memory task.

Based on the known anatomical connectivity of hierarchically organized visual cortical areas and electrophysiological measurements of LFP interactions, a framework for interareal frequency-specific communication has emerged. Our goals were to test the predictions of this framework in the context of the early visual pathways and to understand how attention modulates communication between the visual thalamus and primary visual cortex. We recorded LFPs simultaneously in retinotopically aligned regions of the visual thalamus and primary visual cortex in alert and behaving macaque monkeys trained on a contrast-change detection task requiring covert shifts in visual spatial attention. Coherence and Granger-causal interactions among early visual circuits varied dynamically over different trial periods. Attention significantly enhanced alpha-, beta-, and gamma-frequency interactions, often in a manner consistent with the known anatomy of early visual circuits. However, attentional modulation of communication among early visual circuits was not consistent with a simple static framework in which distinct frequency bands convey directed inputs. Instead, neuronal network interactions in early visual circuits were flexible and dynamic. perhaps reflecting task-related shifts in attention. NEW & NOTEWORTHY Attention alters the way we perceive the visual world. For example, attention can modulate how visual information is communicated between the thalamus and cortex. We recorded local field potentials simultaneously in the visual thalamus and cortex to quantify the impact of attention on visual information communication. We found that attentional modulation of visual information communication was not static, but dynamic over the time course of trials.",coherence; Granger causality; LGN; local field potential; V1; GAMMA-BAND SYNCHRONIZATION; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; GRANGER CAUSALITY; LAMINAR ORGANIZATION; FIELD POTENTIALS; AREAS V1; OSCILLATIONS; MODULATION

To investigate if similar mechanisms are controlling function in the primate brain (Macaca fascicularis) after MPTP-induced neurotoxicity, we conducted PET studies of cerebral blood flow, oxygen and glucose metabolism, dopamine transporter, and D2 receptor function. Our observations after MPTP-induced dopamine terminal degeneration of the caudate and putamen revealed increased blood flow (15%) in the globus pallidus (GP), while blood flow was moderately decreased (15-25%) in the caudate, putamen, and thalamus and 40 % in the primary motor cortex (PMC). Oxygen extraction fraction was moderately increased (10-20%) in other brain areas but the thalamus, where no change was observable. Oxygen metabolism was increased in the GP and SMA (supplementary motor area including premotor cortex, Fig. 3) by a range of 20-40% and decreased in the putamen and caudate and in the PMC. Glucose metabolism was decreased in the caudate, putamen, thalamus, and PMC (range 35-50%) and enhanced in the GP by 15%. No change was observed in the SMA. In the parkinsonian primate, [C-11]CFT (2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-fluorophenyltropane) dopamine transporter binding was significantly decreased in the putamen and caudate (range 60-65%). [C-11]Raclopride binding of dopamine D-2 receptors did not show any significant changes. These experimental results obtained in primate studies of striato-thalamocortico circuitry show a similar trend as hypothetized in Parkinson's disease-type degeneration. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc.

In the first series of experiments, the virus was injected into the MI forelimb region, and the time-dependent distribution patterns of transsynaptic labeling were analyzed in the frontal lobe with various survivals (2-4 d). Two days after the viral injection, neuronal labeling emerged in the caudal aspects of the nonprimary motor-related areas that are known to project to the MI directly. At the same time, the motor thalamus contained labeled neurons. On the third day, cortical labeling extended into the rostral motor-related areas and, also, prearcuate area 8. Moreover, a number of labeled neurons were located in the internal pallidum and the cerebellar nuclei. At the 4 d postinjection period, neuronal labeling occurred widely in prefrontal areas as well as in the putamen and the cerebellar cortex. In the second series of experiments, the viral injection was made into the MI hindlimb region, and the distribution pattern of prefrontal labeling on the fourth day was compared with that in the forelimb-injection case. The labeled neurons in each prefrontal area were much fewer in the hindlimb-injection case than in the forelimb-injection case. Whereas ventral area 46 was most densely labeled from the forelimb region, only sparse labeling from the hindlimb region was observed in this prefrontal area. The present results suggest the importance of ventral area 46 in the cognitive control of forelimb movements.",prefrontal cortex; primary motor cortex; cortical motor-related areas; somatotopy; basal ganglia; cerebellum; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; RHESUS-MONKEY; MACAQUE MONKEY; FRONTAL-LOBE; PREMOTOR AREAS; CORTICOSPINAL PROJECTIONS; TOPOGRAPHIC ORGANIZATION; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE

A total of 23 subjects participated in a block-design functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. Liquid stimuli were presented at supra-threshold concentrations and delivered by means of a computer controlled gustometer. Left and right sides of the mouth were stimulated separately in order to correlate statistical parametrical maps to both the site of the stimulus and the specific taste quality. Following the effects of the site of stimulation through primary and secondary gustatory cortices an effort was made to explore the laterality of the gustatory pathways. Our results showed for both tastants a predominance of ipsilateral connections at the thalamus level. Insula left and right regions were both involved for both tastants. In these regions we found a high proportion of ipsilateral connection again for both the tastants. Considering orbitofrontal/prefrontal cortex, left-sided stimulation with NaCl or MSG produced left-sided activation of the orbito-frontal cortex clearly indicating the presence of an ipsilateral path. Finally, the hypothesis of frontal operculum as primary gustatory cortex and lateral prefrontal cortex as secondary was also supported by the results from dynamic causal modeling.

Here, we present the first validation of eight optogenetic constructs driven by recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) vectors and a WGA-Cre based dual injection strategy for projection targeting in a widely-used New World primate model, the common squirrel monkey Saimiri sciureus. We observed opsin expression around the local injection site and in axonal projections to downstream regions, as well as transduction to thalamic neurons, resembling expression patterns observed in macaques. Optical stimulation drove strong, reliable excitatory responses in local neural populations for two depolarizing opsins in anesthetized monkeys. Finally, we observed continued, healthy opsin expression for at least one year. These data suggest that optogenetic tools can be readily applied in squirrel monkeys, an important first step in enabling precise, targeted manipulation of neural circuits in these highly trainable, cognitively sophisticated animals. In conjunction with similar approaches in macaques and marmosets, optogenetic manipulation of neural circuits in squirrel monkeys will provide functional, comparative insights into neural circuits which subserve dextrous motor control as well as other adaptive behaviors across the primate lineage. Additionally, development of these tools in squirrel monkeys, a well-established model system for several human neurological diseases, can aid in identifying novel treatment strategies.",nan; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; ADENOASSOCIATED VIRUS SEROTYPES; UPPER-LIMB MOTONEURONS; SPINAL-CORD-INJURY; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; PARIETAL CORTEX; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; MILLISECOND-TIMESCALE; NEUROSCIENCE RESEARCH; CORTICOSPINAL CONTROL

Commissural system,"The commissural projections between 13 areas of cat auditory cortex (AC) were studied using retrograde tracers. Areal and laminar origins were characterized as part of a larger study of thalamic input and cortical origins of projections to each area. Cholera toxin beta subunit (CT beta) and cholera toxin beta subunit gold-conjugate (CT beta G) were injected separately within an area or in different areas in an experiment. The areas were identified independently with SMI-32, which revealed differences in neurofilament immunoreactivity in layers III, V, and VI. Each area received convergent AC input from 3 to 6 (mean, 5) contralateral areas. Most of the projections (>75%) were homotopic and from topographically organized loci in the corresponding area. Heterotopic projections (>1 mm beyond the main homotopic projection) constituted approximate to 25% of the input. Layers III and V contained >95% of the commissural neurons. Commissural projection neurons were clustered in all areas. Commissural divergence, assessed by double labeling, was less than 3% in each area. This sparse axonal branching is consistent with the essentially homotopic connectivity of the commissural system. The many heterotopic origins represent unexpected commissural influences converging on an area. Areas more dorsal on the cortical convexity have commissural projections originating in layers III and V; more ventral areas favor layer III at the expense of layer V, to its near-total exclusion in some instances. Some areas have almost entirely layer III origins (temporal cortex and area All), whereas others have a predominantly layer V input (anterior auditory field) or dual contributions from layers III and V (the dorsal auditory zone). A topographic distribution of commissural cells of origin is consistent with the order observed in thalamocortical and corticocortical projections, and which characterizes all extrinsic projection systems (commissural, corticocortical, and thalamocortical) in all AC areas. Thus, laminar as well as areal differences in projection origin distinguish the auditory cortical commissural system.",interhemispheric; divergence; convergence; SMI-32; laminar origins; areal origins; CORTICO-CORTICAL CONNECTIONS; POSTERIOR ECTOSYLVIAN GYRUS; MEDIAL GENICULATE BODY; SOMATIC SENSORY CORTEX; NEUROFILAMENT PROTEIN; CALLOSAL CONNECTIONS; SOUND-LOCALIZATION; MACAQUE MONKEY; VISUAL-CORTEX; DORSAL ZONE

These precerebellar nuclei, in turn, receive a feedback projection from the cerebellar nuclei, which mostly originate in the lateral nucleus (LN). It has been suggested that the feedback projection from the LN partially uses gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as a transmitter. We tested this hypothesis by using a combination of anterograde tracing (biotinylated dextran amine injection into the LN) and postembedding GABA and glutamate immunogold histochemistry. The pattern of labeling in the PN and the NRTP was compared with that of cerebellonuclear terminals in two other target structures, the parvocellular part of the nucleus ruber (RNp) and the ventromedial and ventrolateral thalamus (VM/VL). The projection to the inferior olive (IO), which is known to be predominantly GABAergic, served as a control. A quantitative analysis of the synaptic terminals labeled by the tracer within the PN, the NRTP, and the VL/VM revealed no GABA immunoreactivity. Only one clearly labeled terminal was found in the RNp. In contrast, 72% of the terminals in the IO were clearly GABA immunoreactive, confirming the reliability of our staining protocol. Correspondingly, glutamate immunohistochemistry labeled the majority of the cerebellonuclear terminals in the PN (88%), the NRTP (90%), the RNp (93%), and the VM/VL (63%) but labeled only 5% in the IO. These data do not support a role for GABAergic inhibition either in the feedback systems from the LN to the PN and the NRTP or within the projections to the RNp and the VM/VL.

Major therapeutic advances in the nineties,"Technical aspects: Surgical procedures for abnormal movements progressively evolved toward microinvasive techniques performed under stereotaxic control. The next advance was the development of well-tolerated intracerebral stimulation with reversible effects. The quality of the results depends on optimal definition of the stimulation target. Optimally, the surgical protocol includes stereotaxic ventriculography to identify targets followed by electrical activity recordings of the structures crossed by the electrode. Finally, a minute study of the stimulation effects is performed under sterotaxic control while the patient is awake. Parkinson's diseases: Indications for thalamic stimulation in Parkinson's disease have given way to subthalamic stimulation which improves tremor, bradykinesia and rigidity simultaneously. This result confirms the implication of the subthalamic nucleus in the pathogenesis of Parkinson syndromes.

No other cells of brain tissue exerted KAT-I immunoreactivity during this period. From P3 on, the neurons of the subplate gave rise to KAT-I immunoreactive, varicose axons, which entered the thalamus and terminated around thalamic nerve cells that are devoid of KAT-I immunoreactivity. Other subplate markers displayed a different expression pattern during development. Thus, subplate neurons displayed parvalbumin (PV) immunoreactivity from E16 to P10 and an intense NPY immunoreaction from P7 to P1. They also exhibited nitric oxide synthase immunoreactivity from E16 to P10, whereas on the surface of the subplate neurons, the 0 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) was present from P1 to P10. The cells of Cajal-Retzius were nAChR-immunoreactive during this period. Between P1 and P7, the perikarya of subplate neurons also showed an intense immunoreaction with the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subtype R2A. After the first postnatal week, many of the KAT-I positive subplate neurons display a gradual decrease of immunoreactivity and undergo programmed cell death. Since KAT-I persists in the subplate through the period E16-P7, we conclude that KAT-I is a useful and reliable subplate marker in the rat. Since it is assumed that migration of nerve cells is regulated by NMDA receptors, and since kynurenic acid - the only naturally occurring NMDA receptor antagonist - is synthesized by KAT, we suggest that a temporary breakdown of the delicate equilibrium between NMDA and KAT might induce abnormal neuronal migration, giving rise to developmental abnormalities.",nan; CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEINS; CAT FELIS-DOMESTICA; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; VISUAL-CORTEX; ADULT HUMAN; HUMAN BRAIN; THALAMOCORTICAL CONNECTIONS; POSTNATAL-DEVELOPMENT; INTERSTITIAL NEURONS

The mechanism of burst generation and synchronization in S1 is not yet understood. Using models of single-neuron responses fitted to unit recordings from macaque monkeys, we show that these synchronized bursts are the consequence of correlated synaptic inputs combined with a refractory mechanism. In the presence of noise these models reproduce also the observed trial-to-trial response variability, where individual bursts represent one of many stereotypical temporal spike patterns. When additional slower and global excitability fluctuations are introduced the single-neuron spike patterns are correlated with the population activity, as demonstrated in experimental data. The underlying biophysical mechanism of S1 responses involves thalamic inputs arriving through depressing synapses to cortical neurons in a high-conductance state. Our findings show that a simple feedforward processing of peripheral inputs could give rise to neuronal responses with nontrivial temporal and population statistics. We conclude that neural systems could use refractoriness to encode variable cortical states into stereotypical short-term spike patterns amenable to processing at neuronal time scales (tens of milliseconds).",burst; EEG; modelling; spike patterns; NEOCORTICAL PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; CORTICAL-NEURONS; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; DISCHARGE PATTERNS; THALAMIC NEURONS; VISUAL-CORTEX; FIRE NEURONS; IN-VITRO; OSCILLATIONS; SYNAPSES

Here, we first review the recent literature on the connectivity and the functions of this structure. It appears that this small lobe, taking up less than 2% of the total cortical surface area, receives afferents from some sensory thalamic nuclei, is (mostly reciprocally) connected with the amygdala and with many limbic and association cortical areas, and is implicated in an astonishingly large number of widely different functions, ranging from pain perception and speech production to the processing of social emotions. Next, we embark on a long, adventurous journey through the voluminous literature on the structural organization of the insular cortex. This journey yielded the following take-home messages: (1) The meticulous, but mostly neglected publications of Rose (1928) and Brockhaus (1940) are still invaluable for our understanding of the architecture of the mammalian insular cortex. (2) The relation of the insular cortex to the adjacent claustrum is neither ontogenetical nor functional, but purely topographical. (3) The insular cortex has passed through a spectacular progressive differentiation during hominoid evolution, but the assumption of Craig (2009) that the human anterior insula has no homologue in the rhesus monkey is untenable. (4) The concept of Mesulam and Mufson (1985), that the primate insula is essentially composed of three concentrically arranged zones, agranular, dysgranular, and granular, is presumably correct, but there is at present much confusion concerning the more detailed architecture of the anterior insular cortex. (5) The large spindle-shaped cells in the fifth layer of the insular cortex, currently known as von Economo neurons (VENs), are not only confined to large-brained mammals, such as whales, elephants, apes, and humans, but also occur in monkeys and prosimians, as well as in the pygmy hippopotamus, the Atlantic walrus, and Florida manatee. Finally, we point out that the human insula presents a unique opportunity for performing an in-depth comparative analysis of the relations between structure and function in a typical sensory and a typical cognitive cortical domain.",agranular zone; awareness; cognitive functions; cytoarchitecture; dysgranular zone; granular zone; insula; insular cortex; spindle cells; von Economo neurons; VON ECONOMO NEURONS; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; CORTICAL PROJECTIONS; SOMATOSENSORY AREA; VESTIBULAR CORTEX; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; PAIN; ORGANIZATION; RESPONSES

To test this hypothesis in the macaque monkey, we used a subtype-specific antibody to the m2 muscarinic receptor. Immunoreactive cells were well visualized in the nucleus basalis, where some of these cells displayed dense m2 immunoreactivity, while others were lightly labeled. This heterogeneity of labeling intensity was not based on peculiarities of the methodology, because cholinergic cells of the striatum expressed uniformly dense m2 immunoreactivity. Concurrent labeling with choline acetyltransferase immunoreactivity proved that most of the heavily m2-labeled cells in the nucleus basalis were also choline acetyltransferase positive. The Endings demonstrate that at least 10-25% of the cholinergic neurons in the nucleus basalis of the monkey are densely m2 immunoreactive. In the striatum, concurrent labeling demonstrated that the majority, if not all, choline acetyltransferase-positive cells also contained m2 immunoreactivity. In addition, these experiments identified a population of smaller striatal cells which were m2 immunoreactive and choline acetyltransferase negative. Consecutive labeling with m2 immunoreactivity and NADPH-diaphorase histochemistry demonstrated that many of these m2-immunoreactive non-cholinergic neurons belonged to the population of nitric oxide-synthesizing medium aspiny neurons. The findings indicate that the m2 muscarinic receptor may be expressed at high levels in only a subset of cholinergic basal forebrain neurons. In contrast, m2 receptors appear to be expressed by all cholinergic cells of the striatum. (C) 1999 IBRO.

A fundamental issue concerns the roles that thalamocortical input and intracortical connectivity play in generating the activities. Here we addressed this issue in guinea pigs using in vivo and in vitro real-time optical imaging techniques. As reported previously, tone-evoked activity propagated dorsoventrally along a strip (an IS) in AI. We found that an electrical pulse applied focally within the strip, triggered activity propagation with a spatiotemporal pattern highly similar to tone-evoked activation. The propagation velocity of electrically evoked activity was significantly slower than that of tone-evoked activity, but was comparable to the velocity of lateral activity propagation in cortical slices, suggesting that the electrically evoked activity propagation in vivo is mediated by intracortical circuits. To test this notion, we lesioned the auditory thalamus chemically; in such animals, electrically evoked activity in AI was not affected, although tone-evoked activity was abolished. Further, in slices of the AI, the extent of electrically evoked activity propagation in layer II/III was significantly larger in coronal slices than in horizontal slices. Together, our results suggest that intracortical connectivity in AI enables a focally evoked activity to propagate throughout an IS.",cortical dynamics; electrical stimulation; intracortical circuits; optical recording; propagating activity; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; MEDIAL GENICULATE-BODY; FREQUENCY REPRESENTATION; TONOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; FUNCTIONAL TOPOGRAPHY; MODULAR ORGANIZATION; NEURAL ACTIVITIES; MACAQUE MONKEY; VISUAL-CORTEX; CAT

Previous experiments have indicated that the periodicity of these columns can be influenced by visual experience: compared to normally raised animals both strabismic cats and cats raised with alternating monocular exposure displayed an increased spacing of adjacent ocular dominance columns in the primary visual cortex (area 17). However, recently it was shown that the formation of ocular dominance columns begins much earlier than previously supposed, indicating that early visual experience might only have a limited influence on the development of the spatial pattern of ocular dominance columns. We therefore visualized the complete pattern of ocular dominance columns in area 17 of normally raised and strabismic kittens during early postnatal development (age 3-6 weeks), particularly focussing on littermates. In addition, we used a previously developed spatial analysis (period statistics) to quantify columnar spacing two-dimensionally. We observed a pronounced interindividual variability in both normally raised and strabismic animals, with column spacings ranging from 783 to 1362 mum. In contrast to previous reports, there were no significant differences in columnar periodicity between normally raised and strabismic cats. These data indicate that rearing has less influence on column spacing while the interindividual variability is much greater than previously supposed, suggesting that genetic differences have an influence on column spacing.",area 17; columnar spacing; 2-deoxyglucose; ocular dominance columns; strabismus; CAT VISUAL-CORTEX; STRIATE CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEYS; EYE ALIGNMENT; ORIENTATION; EXPERIENCE; MAPS; DEPRIVATION; PERIODICITY; TOPOGRAPHY

The projection of cells in the cervical spinal cord of monkeys to the cuneate nucleus has been reported to avoid pars rotunda of that nucleus, the part that contains the somatotopic representation of the ipsilateral hand. We used the sensitive anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin to reexamine this projection. We made multiple iontophoretic injections into the cervical enlargements of three monkeys (two Macaca fascicularis and one Macaca mulatta). Control injections were made in the contralateral dorsal columns of one of these and in the dorsal roots of a fourth animal (M. fascicularis) to test for transport by fibers of passage. After 28-39 days, the animals were deeply anesthetized and perfused, and the tissue was processed for immunohistochemical detection of the label. In all cases (excluding control injections), labeled fibers and varicosities were distributed widely in the ipsilateral cuneate and external cuneate nuclei, including pars rotunda. The dorsal column nuclei ipsilateral to control injections contained no label or only very few poorly labeled fibers, indicating that labeling through fibers of passage did not contribute importantly to the results.

Histological and immunohistochemical techniques were used to trace the development of a laminar cytoarchitecture and an adult pattern of axonal neurofilament expression. From the 16th fetal week to the 4th postnatal month, the cortex progresses from a marginal layer and an undifferentiated cortical plate to incipient lamination. Between the 22nd fetal week and the 4th postnatal month, a two-tiered band of neurofilament-immunoreactive axons develops in layer I, but subsequent to the 4th month, the number of immunopositive axons in this layer is greatly reduced. Between the middle of the first year of life and age 3 years, the laminar pattern of cytoarchitecture becomes fully mature and a network of immunostained axons develops in layers VI, V, IV, and IIIc. This axonal plexus in the deep cortical layers continues to increase in density until age 5. Beginning at 5 years of age, a network of neurofilament-positive axons develops in the superficial layers IIIb, IIIa, and II, and by 11-12 years of age, overall axonal density is equivalent to that seen in young adulthood. This extended time span of axonal maturation has implications for the emergence of auditory cortical function.",development; neurofilaments; thalamocortical; callosal; transcortical; HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; HUMAN VISUAL-CORTEX; MEDIAL GENICULATE AXONS; CAJAL-RETZIUS NEURONS; HUMAN STRIATE CORTEX; LAYER-I; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; POSTNATAL-DEVELOPMENT; RHESUS-MONKEY; PRENATAL DEVELOPMENT

Left and right IFCop are implicated in developmental stuttering. Weak left IFCop connections and divergent connectivity of hyperactive right IFCop regions have been related to impeded speech. Here, we reanalyzed diffusion magnetic resonance imaging data from 83 children (41 stuttering). We generated connection probability maps of functionally segregated area 44 parcels and calculated hemisphere-wise analyses of variance. Children who stutter showed reduced connectivity of executive, rostral-motor, and caudal-motor corticostriatal projections from the left IFCop. We discuss this finding in the context of tracing studies from the macaque area 44, which leads to the need to reconsider current models of speech motor control. Unlike the left, the right IFCop revealed increased connectivity of the inferior posterior ventral parcel and decreased connectivity of the posterior dorsal parcel with the anterior insula, particularly in stuttering boys. This divergent connectivity pattern in young children adds to the debate on potential core deficits in stuttering and challenges the theory that right hemisphere differences might exclusively indicate compensatory changes that evolve from lifelong exposure. Instead, early right prefrontal connectivity differences may reflect additional brain signatures of aberrant cognition-emotion-action influencing speech motor control.",stuttering; diffusion-weighted imaging; probabilistic tractography; inferior frontal gyrus pars opercularis; basal ganglia thalamocortical circuitry; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; INSULAR CORTEX; BROCAS REGION; SPEECH PRODUCTION; PRECENTRAL GYRUS; VERBAL FLUENCY; BRAIN; LANGUAGE; ORGANIZATION; MATTER

For quantitative analysis of 5-HT2A binding in vivo, PET scan of [C-11]MDL100,907 was performed with arterial blood sampling in each animal, and the metabolic-corrected arterial input function was used for Logan graphical analysis. Higher cerebral binding of [C-11]MDL100,907 was observed in the hippocampus, cingulate gyrus, frontal, temporal and occipital cortices, regions known to contain high densities of 5-HT2A, by in vitro assay. Binding was intermediate in the striatum and thalamus, and lower in the pens and cerebellum in both young and aged monkeys. The age-related decrease in [C-11]MDL100,907 binding to 5-HT2A receptors was prominent in the hippocampus, cingulate gyrus, frontal, temporal and occipital cortices, but not in the striatum, thalamus and pens.

Anatomical investigations in animals and post-mortem humans have established that cerebro-cerebellar connections are contralateral to each other and include the cerebello-thalamo-cortical (CTC) and cortico-ponto-cerebellar (CPC) pathways. CTC and CPC characterization in humans in vivo is still challenging. Here advanced tractography was combined with quantitative indices to compare CPC to CTC pathways in healthy subjects. Differently to previous studies, our findings reveal that cerebellar cognitive areas are reached by the largest proportion of the reconstructed CPC, supporting the hypothesis that a CTC-CPC loop provides a substrate for cerebro-cerebellar communication during cognitive processing. Amongst the cerebral areas identified using in vivo tractography, in addition to the cerebral motor cortex, major portions of CPC streamlines leave the prefrontal and temporal cortices. These findings are useful since provide MRI-based indications of possible subtending connectivity and, if confirmed, they are going to be a milestone for instructing computational models of brain function. These results, together with further multi-modal investigations, are warranted to provide important cues on how the cerebro-cerebellar loops operate and on how pathologies involving cerebro-cerebellar connectivity are generated.",nan; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL SULCUS; INTRINSIC FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; DIFFUSION TENSOR TRACTOGRAPHY; CORTICO-CEREBELLAR SYSTEM; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; HUMAN BRAIN; STREAMLINES TRACTOGRAPHY; FIBER ORIENTATION; MRI TRACTOGRAPHY; RHESUS-MONKEY

The animals were trained on two reaching tasks and one tactile texture discrimination task. Task 1 simply involved reaching toward and grasping a reward from one of five well positions. Task 2 required the monkey to use both hands simultaneously to obtain a reward. The tactile texture discrimination task required the monkey to signal the roughness of a passively delivered texture using its jaw. After lesions to area 5, the monkeys showed a decrease in hand use for tasks 1 and 2 and an inability to perform task 2 in specific locations in visual space. These deficits recovered within several days. No deficits were observed in the tactile texture discrimination task or in an analgesic control monkey. Electrophysiological recordings made just before the lesion, immediately after the lesion, and 2 months after the lesion demonstrated that cortical areas just rostral to the lesioned area 5, and areas 1 and 2, were topographically reorganized and that receptive fields for neurons in these fields changed location on the body surface. These cortical map changes are correlative and may, in part, contribute to the rapid behavioral recovery observed. The mechanism for such rapid changes may be the unmasking of existing divergent and convergent thalamocortical connections that are part of the normal cortical circuitry.",nan; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; POSTCENTRAL SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; ADULT OWL MONKEYS; MACAQUE MONKEYS; HAND REPRESENTATION; TACTILE STIMULATION; SQUIRREL-MONKEYS; CONNECTIONS; MOVEMENT; REORGANIZATION

However, it is unclear when and how the cerebellar outputs contribute to M1 activity. To address this question, we examined the response of M1 neurons to electrical stimulation of the DN and M1 activity during performance of arm-reaching tasks. Based on response patterns to DN stimulation, M1 neurons were classified into facilitation-, suppression-, and no-response-types. During tasks, not only facilitation- and suppression-type M1 neurons, but also no response-type M1 neurons increased or decreased their firing rates in relation to arm reaching movements. However, the firing rates of facilitation- and suppression-type neurons were higher than those of no-response-type neurons during both inter-trial intervals and arm reaching movements. These results imply that cerebellar outputs contribute to both spontaneous and movement-related activity in the M1, which help to maintain muscle tones and execute coordinated movements, although other inputs also contribute to movement-related activity. Pharmacological inactivation of the DN supports this notion, in that DN inactivation reduced both spontaneous firing rates and movement-related activity in the M1.

Here we used retrograde transneuronal transport of rabies virus to identify neurons in the cerebellar nuclei that project via the thalamus to supplementary eye field (SEF) of the frontal cortex of macaques. After rabies injections into the SEF, many neurons in the restricted region, the ventral aspects of the dentate nucleus (DN), the caudal pole of the DN, and the posterior interpositus nucleus (PIN) were labeled disynaptically via the thalamus, whereas no neuron labeling was found in the anterior interpositus nucleus (AIN). The distribution of the labeled neurons was dorsoventrally different from that of DN and PIN neurons labeled from the motor cortex. In the basal ganglia, a large number of labeled neurons were confined to the dorsomedial portion of the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) as more neurons were labeled in the inner portion of the GPi (GPii) than in the outer portion of the GPi (GPio).

[C-11]-Mecamylamine was prepared and evaluated as a putative radioligand for positron emission tomography to study nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. The radiosynthesis consisted in the [C-11]-methylation of the desmethyl precursor within 40 min with 30-40% radiochemical yield decay corrected. Biodistribution studies in rats showed that radioligand crossed the blood-brain barrier (0.39% ID at 30 min) and only unmetabolized tracer was recovered from brain at 45 min. Ex vivo autoradiography studies in rats did not indicate preferential uptake, and pre-treatment mecamylamine or with chlorisondamine, an nicotinic receptor inhibitor, did not demonstrate a significant specific binding. To investigate possible specie differences and effects of anesthesia, in vivo positron emission tomography (PET) studies were carried out on anaesthetized baboons and conscious macaques. The regional brain distribution of [C-11]-mecamylamine in the two species of primates exhibited similar kinetics as did the rat with steady state reached about 45-50 min after radiotracer administration. Uptake values were two-fold higher in brain of conscious macaque than in anaesthetized baboon (thalamus: 0.258% ID/(kg mL) in conscious macaques and 0.129% ID/(kg mL) in baboons). PET images showed a radioactivity distribution which was quite homogeneous throughout the brain but with somewhat higher uptake in grey matter than in white. Brain distribution was unaltered by saturation or displacement studies. Possible explanation for the failure to establish specific binding in vivo could be long-lived structural modifications of the ionotropic channel by the unlabeled ligand administered before the tracer. In conclusion, [C-11]-mecamylamine did not satisfy the requirements for a PET tracer of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Some response features, including all spatial receptive field characteristics and bursting behavior, are entirely normal in beta2-/- dLGN cells. In other respects, the responses of beta2-/- dLGN cells are quantitatively abnormal: the mutation is associated with higher spontaneous and visually evoked firing rates, faster visual response latencies, a preference for higher temporal frequencies, and a trend toward greater contrast sensitivity. The normal response properties in the beta2-/- dLGN show that none of the many effects of the mutation, including disrupted geniculate functional organization and abnormal cholinergic transmission, have any effect on spatial response characteristics and bursting behavior in dLGN neurons. The abnormal response characteristics in the beta2-/- dLGN are most interesting in that they are no worse than normal; any visual processing deficits found in studies of the beta2-/- visual cortex must therefore arise solely from abnormalities in cortical processing.",nicotinic acetylcholine receptor; dLGN; mouse; physiology; development; thalamus; THALAMIC NEURONS; RELAY CELLS; THALAMOCORTICAL RELAY; CONTRAST SENSITIVITY; ACTIVITY PATTERNS; FIELD PROPERTIES; MACAQUE MONKEYS; RETINAL WAVES; BURST; CAT

Although developmental mechanisms that govern the regional patterning of the cerebral cortex have been characterized in rodents(6-9), the mechanisms that underlie the development of PFC-mediodorsal thalamus connectivity and the lateral expansion of the PFC with a distinct granular layer 4 in primates(10,11) remain unknown. Here we report an anterior (frontal) to posterior (temporal), PFC-enriched gradient of retinoic acid, a signalling molecule that regulates neural development and function(12-15), and we identify genes that are regulated by retinoic acid in the neocortex of humans and macaques at the early and middle stages of fetal development. We observed several potential sources of retinoic acid, including the expression and cortical expansion of retinoic-acid-synthesizing enzymes specifically in primates as compared to mice. Furthermore, retinoic acid signalling is largely confined to the prospective PFC by CYP26B1, a retinoic-acid-catabolizing enzyme, which is upregulated in the prospective motor cortex. Genetic deletions in mice revealed that retinoic acid signalling through the retinoic acid receptors RXRG and RARB, as well as CYP26B1-dependent catabolism, are involved in proper molecular patterning of prefrontal and motor areas, development of PFC-mediodorsal thalamus connectivity, intra-PFC dendritic spinogenesis and expression of the layer 4 marker RORB. Together, these findings show that retinoic acid signalling has a critical role in the development of the PFC and, potentially, in its evolutionary expansion.",nan; HUMAN BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT; GENE-EXPRESSION; CORTEX; TRANSFORMATION; TRANSCRIPTOME; PATHOGENESIS; ORGANOIDS; EVOLUTION; OUTGROWTH; INSIGHTS

To overcome these issues, we propose two new dimensionality reduction methods that use minimum and maximum information models. These methods are information theoretic extensions of STC that can be used with non-Gaussian stimulus distributions to find relevant linear subspaces of arbitrary dimensionality. We compare these new methods to the conventional methods in two ways: with biologically-inspired simulated neurons responding to natural images and with recordings from macaque retinal and thalamic cells responding to naturalistic time-varying stimuli.

The following components of the somatosensory evoked potentials were simultaneously recorded from 21-27 epidural electrodes: P7 (the letter indicates positive or negative polarity; the number indicates the approximate latency of the peak in ms) was recorded widely from various locations on both the left and right hemispheres, P10 was recorded near the anterior side of the central sulcus contralateral to the stimulation side, N10 was recorded near the posterior side of the contralateral central sulcus, P12 was recorded on both sides of the contralateral central sulcus, and P18 was recorded posterior to the contralateral central sulcus. Current source generators (dipoles) of each component of somatosensory evoked potentials were localized by dipole tracing: a dipole for P7 was located in the thalamus contralateral to the stimulation side; a dipole for P10 and N10 in the posterior wall of the contralateral central sulcus (area 3b); a dipole for P12 in the contralateral post central gyrus (areas 1 and 2); and a dipole for P18 in the anterior wall of the contralateral intraparietal sulcus (area 5). The locations and latencies of dipoles that generated cortical components of somatosensory evoked potentials, estimated by dipole tracing, were confirmed by direct cortical surface recording from a 16-25 electrode array placed directly on the cortical surface; and multiple unit recording from the anterior and posterior parietal cortices. After excision of area 5, P18 and N18 were abolished, whereas P10, N10, and P12 were not affected.

As the original Papez circuit failed to explain functional imaging findings, a more detailed investigation is needed to delineate connections among the circuit's key hubs. Here we acquired diffusion spectrum imaging (DSI) from eight normal subjects and used data from the Human Connectome Project (HCP) to elucidate connections among hubs in the retrosplenial gyrus, hippocampus, mammillary bodies, and anterior thalamic nuclei. Our results show that the ventral hippocampal commissure (VHC) was visualized in all eight individual DSI datasets, as well as in the DSI and HCP group datasets, but a strictly defined VHC was only visualized in one individual dataset. Thalamic fibers were observed to connect with both the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and retrosplenial cortex (RSC). The RSC was mainly responsible for direct hippocampal connections, while the PCC was not. This indicates that the RSC and PCC represent separate functional hubs in humans, as also shown by previous primate axonal tracing studies and functional magnetic resonance imaging observations.

We previously found a substantial 25% reduction in neuron number of the primary visual cortex (Brodmann's area 17, BA17) in postmortem tissue from subjects with schizophrenia. Also, many studies have found reduced volume and neuron number of the pulvinar-the large thalamic association nucleus involved in higher-order visual processing. Here, we investigate if the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), the visual relay nucleus of the thalamus, has structural changes in schizophrenia. We used stereological methods based on unbiased principles of sampling (Cavalieri's principle and the optical fractionator) to estimate the total volume and neuron number of the magno- and parovocellular parts of the left LGN in postmortem brains from nine subjects with schizophrenia, seven matched normal comparison subjects and 13 subjects with mood disorders. No significant schizophrenia-related structural differences in volume or neuron number of the left LGN or its major subregions were found, but we did observe a significantly increased total volume of the LGN, and of the parvocellular lamina and interlaminar regions, in the mood group. These findings do not support the hypothesis that subjects with schizophrenia have structural changes in the LGN. Therefore, our previous observation of a schizophrenia-related reduction of the primary visual cortex is probably not secondary to a reduction in the LGN.",Stereology; Cell count; Schizophrenia; Mood disorders; Lateral geniculate body; UNBIASED STEREOLOGICAL ESTIMATION; MEDIODORSAL THALAMIC NUCLEUS; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEYS; MAJOR DEPRESSION; BRAIN COLLECTION; TISSUE SHRINKAGE; CHRONIC EXPOSURE; OPTIC TRACT; Z-AXIS

We studied the structural, topographic, neurochemical and intrinsic connectional features of IM neurons in the rhesus monkey brain. We found that the intercalated neurons are not confined to discrete cell clusters, but form a neuronal net that is interposed between the basal nuclei and extends to the dorsally located anterior, central, and medial nuclei of the amygdala. Unlike the IM in rodents, which are prominent in the anterior half of the amygdala, the primate inhibitory net stretched throughout the antero-posterior axis of the amygdala, and was most prominent in the central and posterior extent of the amygdala. There were two morphologic types of intercalated neurons: spiny and aspiny. Spiny neurons were the most abundant; their somata were small or medium size, round or elongated, and their dendritic trees were round or bipolar, depending on location. The aspiny neurons were on average slightly larger and had varicose dendrites with no spines. There were three nonoverlapping neurochemical populations of IM neurons, in descending order of abundance: (1) Spiny neurons that were positive for the striatal associated dopamine-and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein (DARPP-32+); (2) Aspiny neurons that expressed the calcium-binding protein calbindin (CB+); and (3) Aspiny neurons that expressed nitric oxide synthase (NOS+). The unique combinations of structural and neurochemical features of the three classes of IM neurons suggest different physiological properties and function. The three types of IM neurons were intermingled and likely interconnected in distinct ways, and were innervated by intrinsic neurons within the amygdala, or by external sources, in pathways that underlie fear conditioning and anxiety.

The cerebellum has interconnections with brainstem and thalamic reticular systems that subserve arousal. Autonomic activity is supported by the reciprocal interconnections with the hypothalamus. Limbic and paralimbic connections include the hypothalamus, septal region, hippocampus, and cingulate gyrus. Associative connections consist of both feedforward and feedback limbs. The basilar pons receives inputs from the prefrontal, posterior parietal, superior temporal, parahippocampal, and cingulate cortices, as well as from the sensorimotor cortices. This information is conveyed from the pons to cerebellum, before it is relayed back via thalamus to the associative and paralimbic regions of the cerebral cortex. The anatomical arrangement of segregated loops of cerebral cortical connections stands in contrast to the cerebellar cortical architecture that is essentially uniform. This has theoretical and clinical ramifications. It is the anatomical basis for the dysmetria of thought hypothesis that postulates a universal cerebellar transform, in which the cerebellum performs its unique computation in a topographically precise manner on diverse streams of information relating to almost all aspects of behavior including cognition and emotion. It provides an anatomic basis for the observations of cerebellar activation by cognitive and affective paradigms in functional neuroimaging experiments.

Their responses to various visual stimuli and to electrical stimulation of the optic chiasm and the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) were characterized. In retrograde double-labelling experiments, the pretectal projections to the LP-P and to the LGN were tested for possible overlap. Forty-five neurons were antidromically activated from the LP-P; 55 % of them could also be activated orthodromically from the optic chiasm. Most antidromically activated neurons responded to rapid movements of large textured visual stimuli as well as to 'on' or 'off' visual stimulation with short bursts. When stimulated with a slowly moving, large, structured visual stimulus, most cells showed a slight but significant activity increase. None of the neurons projecting to the LP-P was also activated antidromically from the LGN. Thus, the two populations are separate. This is supported by the results from the retrograde double-labelling experiments. None of the LP-P projecting neurons showed any directional selectivity to slow movements of large visual stimuli, a property by which pretectal neurons projecting to the inferior olive are characterized. Thus, neurons projecting to the LP-P do not bifurcate to the inferior olive. Response properties of neurons projecting to the LP-P were very similar to those of the 'jerk' neurons described by Schweigart and Hoffmann (Exp. Brain Res., 91, 273-283, 1992); therefore we believe them to be identical. Jerk neurons are known to react not only to rapid image shifts with short high-frequency bursts, but also to saccadic eye movements in the light. As a possible function of LP-P projecting neurons, the transfer of information about image displacement during saccades or fast-moving objects in the visual scene is discussed.",VISION; PRETECTUM; VISUAL THALAMUS; ELECTRICAL STIMULATION; OPTIC TRACT; GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; QUANTITATIVE-ANALYSIS; VISUAL RESPONSES; MACAQUE MONKEY; GANGLION-CELLS; RHESUS-MONKEY; EYE-MOVEMENTS; UNIT-ACTIVITY

We present a modular neural network model of these areas that encodes the serial order of events into spatial patterns of PF activity. The model is based on the topographically specific circuits linking the PF with the basal ganglia. Each module traces a pathway from the PF, through the basal ganglia and thalamus, and back to the PF. The complete model consists of an array of modules interacting through recurrent corticostriatal projections and collateral inhibition between striatal spiny units. The model's architecture positions spiny units for the classification of cortical contexts and events and provides bistable cortical-thalamic loops for sustaining a representation of these contextual events in working memory activations. The model was tested with a simulated version of a delayed-sequencing task. In single-unit studies, the task begins with the presentation of a sequence of target lights. After a short delay, the monkey must touch the targets in the order in which they were presented. When instantiated with randomly distributed corticostriatal weights, the model produces different patterns of PF activation in response to different target sequences. These patterns represent an unambiguous and spatially distributed encoding of the sequence. Parameter studies of these random networks were used to compare the computational consequences of collateral and feed-forward inhibition within the striatum. In addition, we studied the receptive fields of 20,640 model units and uncovered an interesting set of cue-, rank- and sequence-related responses that qualitatively resemble responses reported in single unit studies of the PF. The majority of units respond to more than one sequence of stimuli. A method for analyzing serial receptive fields is presented and utilized for comparing the model units to single-unit data.",nan; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA; MONKEY CAUDATE NEURONS; SPATIAL WORKING-MEMORY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; CORTICOSTRIATAL PROJECTIONS; MACAQUE MONKEY; FUNCTIONAL-PROPERTIES

They were then examined using the electron microscope for their synaptic contacts, both the afferent contacts onto their dendrites and their presynaptic dendritic contacts onto presumptive projection (relay) neuron dendrites. The somata of these interneurons were small (mean = 178 mu m(2)), but the dendritic trees were large compared with those of projection neurons. All three interneurons had similar synaptic patterns onto their dendrites with about equal numbers of retinal, cortical, and GABAergic contacts. The distribution of these contacts was more uniform compared with the same types of contacts made onto projection neurons. The presynaptic dendrites were observed to contact only the dendrites of presumptive projection neurons, and these contacts were nearly all in the form of geniculate triads. None of the three interneurons displayed an axon. The receptive fields of these interneurons were similar to those of projection cells, but were larger and had center-response signs that were the opposite of the projection neurons around them (e.g. OFF center for the dorsal part of the parvocellular mass where ON-center projection neurons reside). The squirrel monkey data provides additional evidence that one aspect of the laminar pattern observed in the parvocellular pathway of the primate's dLGN might be related to a segregation of projection neurons of one center-response sign with interneurons of the opposite center-response sign.",primate; visual pathways; horseradish peroxidase; thalamus; THALAMIC RETICULAR NUCLEUS; GLUTAMIC-ACID DECARBOXYLASE; GALAGO-CRASSICAUDATUS; RHESUS-MONKEY; ULTRASTRUCTURAL IDENTIFICATION; LAMINAR ORGANIZATION; GABAERGIC NEURONS; STRIATE CORTEX; RELAY CELLS; CAT

However, little anatomical data are available in human about the functional networks these cingulate areas underlie. Therefore, networks anchored in the rostral and caudal cingulate motor areas (rCMA and cCMA, respectively) were studied in human using functional connectivity during the brain resting state. Since the rCMA and cCMA are located just under the pre-supplementary and supplementary motor areas (pre-SMA and SMA), the pre-SMA- and SMA-centered networks were also studied to ensure that these four circuits were correctly dissociated. Data from 14 right-handed healthy volunteers were acquired at rest and analyzed by region of interest (ROI)-based functional connectivity. The blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal fluctuations of separate ROIs located in rCMA, cCMA, pre-SMA, and SMA were successively used to identify significant temporal correlations with BOLD signal fluctuations of other brain regions. Low-frequency BOLD signal of the CMA was correlated with signal fluctuations in the prefrontal, cingulate, insular, premotor, motor, medial and inferior parietal cortices, putamen and thalamus, and anticorrelated with the default-mode network. rCMA was more in relation with prefrontal, orbitofrontal, and language-associated cortices than cCMA more related to sensory cortex. These cingulate networks were very similar to the pre-SMA- and SMA-centered networks, although pre-SMA and SMA showed stronger correlation with the prefrontal and inferior parietal cortices and with the cerebellum and the superior parietal cortex, respectively. The human cingulate motor areas constitute an interface between sensorimotor, limbic and executive systems, sharing common cortical, striatal, and thalamic relays with the overlying premotor medial areas.",Functional connectivity; Resting state; Motor cingulate cortex; Supplementary motor area; Pre-supplementary motor area; RHESUS-MONKEY; BASAL GANGLIA; MEDIAL WALL; CORTEX; SUPPLEMENTARY; ORGANIZATION; ACTIVATION; INPUT

In humans, the organization and layout of core and belt auditory fields are still poorly understood, and most auditory neuroimaging studies rely on macroanatomical criteria, rather than functional localization of distinct fields. A myeloarchitectonic method has been suggested recently for distinguishing between core and belt fields in humans (Dick F, Tierney AT, Lutti A, Josephs O, Sereno MI, Weiskopf N. 2012. In vivo functional and myeloarchitectonic mapping of human primary auditory areas. J Neurosci. 32:16095-16105). We propose a marker for core AC based directly on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data and pattern classification. We show that a portion of AC in Heschl's gyrus classifies sound frequency more accurately than other regions in AC. Using fMRI data from macaques, we validate that the region where frequency classification performance is significantly above chance overlaps core auditory fields, predominantly A1. Within this region, we measure tonotopic gradients and estimate the locations of the human homologues of the core auditory subfields A1 and R. Our results provide a functional rather than anatomical localizer for core AC. We posit that inter-individual variability in the layout of core AC might explain disagreements between results from previous neuroimaging and cytological studies.",hearing; tonotopy; ARCHITECTONIC FIELDS; MACAQUE MONKEYS; HUMAN BRAIN; ORGANIZATION; SUBDIVISIONS; REPRESENTATION; CONNECTIONS; PRIMATES; SOUNDS; SENSITIVITY

Recent findings in the monkey and in humans have led to a parallel and interconnected network. Nevertheless, little is known about these networks. Here, we present two cases of patients with a parietal low-grade glioma. They underwent surgery under local anesthesia with cortical and subcortical mapping. For patient 1, subcortical electrostimulation immediately posterior to thalamocortical fibers induced movement disorders, with an inhibition of leg and arm movements medially and, more laterally, an acceleration of arm movement. For patient 2, electrostimulation of white matter immediately posterior to thalamocortical fibers induced an inhibition of both arm movement. It means that the detected fibers in the parietal lobe may be involved in the motor control modulation. They are distributed veil-like immediately posterior to thalamocortical pathways and could correspond to a fronto-parietal movement control subnetwork. These two cases highlight the major role of the subcortical connectivity in movement regulation, involving parietal lobe, thus the necessity to be identified and preserved during brain surgery.",Parietal lobe; Motor control; Negative motor area; Brain tumor; Direct electrical stimulation; SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA; FRONTAL-CORTEX; STIMULATION; SURGERY; LOBE; PROJECTIONS; MACAQUE; LESIONS; SYSTEM

Here, we determined whether the upstream cortical areas, secondary somatosensory (S2) and parietal ventral (PV) areas, also undergo reorganization after lesions of the dorsal columns. Areas S2, PV, and 3b were mapped after long-term unilateral lesions of the dorsal columns at cervical levels in adult macaque monkeys. In areas S2 and PV, we found neurons responding to touch on the face in regions in which responses to touch on the hand and other body parts are normally seen. In the reorganized parts of S2 and PV, inputs from the chin as well as other parts of the face were observed, whereas in area 3b only the chin inputs expand into the deafferented regions. The results show that deafferentations lead to a more widespread brain reorganization than previously known. The data also show that reorganization in areas S2 and PV shares a common substrate with area 3b, but there are specific features that emerge in S2 and PV.",nan; PERIPHERAL-NERVE INJURY; MASSIVE CORTICAL REORGANIZATION; PRINCIPAL SENSORY NUCLEUS; BRAIN-STEM CONTRIBUTIONS; PHANTOM-LIMB PAIN; MACAQUE MONKEYS; ADULT MONKEYS; FUNCTIONAL REORGANIZATION; MOTOR CORTEX; SUBCORTICAL CONTRIBUTIONS

The boutons formed asymmetric (Gray's type 1) synapses with spines (54%), dendrites (33%), and somata (13%), All somatic targets and some (26%) of the target dendritic shafts showed features characteristic of smooth (inhibitory) cells. Each bouton formed, on average, 1.7 synapses. The larger boutons formed multiple synapses with the same neuron and completely enveloped the entire spine head. On most dendritic shafts and all somata the postsynaptic density en face was disk-shaped but in about half the cases the reconstructed postsynaptic densities of synapses on spines appeared as complete or partial annuli. Even in the zones of densest innervation only 3% of the asymmetric synapses were formed by the labeled boutons.

Pharmacological studies have shown that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are involved in the plasticity of the visual cortex just as they are involved in the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP), another activity-dependent form of plasticity. The setting up of synaptic connectivity in the neocortex may rely on LTP-like mechanisms. By using immunohistochemistry techniques, we tested the hypothesis of the role of subunit R1 of NMDA (NMDAR1) receptors in the thalamocortical afferent segregation into ocular-dominance columns in the New World monkey, Callithrix jacchus. We employed early and short (2 weeks) monocular-deprivation periods at different ages of postnatal development(17, 46, 67, 107, and 188 postnatal days). We observed heterogeneous distribution of NMDAR1 in the layer IVC receiving the thalamic inputs if the deprivation was realized between the ages of 46 and 107 days. Layers IVC alpha and IVC beta were involved differently as a function of the deprivation age. The striped pattern lost its differential intensity with the postnatal age. These results are compared with the ocular-dominance pattern evolution described in other works on this primate. They provide evidence of the NMDAR1 role in the modular organization, within time limits, during the postnatal development of the primary visual cortex.

It is characterized by the presence of retinal afferents and peptidergic cells projecting via a geniculohypothalamic tract (GHT) to the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), site of the mammalian circadian clock. The adult IGL also contains abundant reactive astrocytes immunoreactive to GFAP. Because glia have a large role in brain development, we examined the ontogeny of the hamster IGL with respect to both glial and neuronal markers. Neuropeptide Y-immunoreactive (NPY-IR) cells destined for the IGL appear on embryonic day 11 (E11) in a matrix of vimentin (VIM)-IR radial glia. Migratory ellipsoid NPY-IR cells with long leading and trailing processes become oriented between the reticular thalamic neuroepithelial lobule, and the developing IGL. Most NPY-IR cells arrive in the IGL by E14 and extend axons ventrally into the GHT. These penetrate the SCN at P3 and arborize to an adult-like stage by pin. A specialized GFAP-IR radial glial path coinciding with the migratory route of NPY-IR cells appears by E14. As early as E15, cells contributing to this path are found displaced away from the ventricle. As the glial path disappears from the maturing brain, the entire length of the IGL becomes filled with GFAP-IR astrocytes. These features are consistent with translocation and transformation of a specialized set of radial glia into IGL astrocytes. The results demonstrate that the IGL is a large, developmentally important, feature of the lateral geniculate complex that is embryologically distinct from adjacent dorsal and ventrolateral geniculate nuclei.",HAMSTER; INTERGENICULATE LEAFLET; SUPRACHIASMATIC NUCLEUS; RETICULAR THALAMIC NUCLEUS; VENTROLATERAL GENICULATE; DORSOLATERAL GENICULATE; ASTROCYTE; RADIAL GLIA; NEUROPEPTIDE Y; GLIAL FIBRILLARY ACIDIC PROTEIN; VIMENTIN; MIGRATION; VISUAL SYSTEM; DEVELOPMENT; RADIAL GLIA; POSTNATAL-DEVELOPMENT; RETINAL PROJECTIONS; SYRIAN-HAMSTERS; SUPRACHIASMATIC NUCLEUS; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODY; CELL MIGRATION; RHESUS-MONKEY; BRAIN; ASTROCYTES

We investigated whether this sparing was due to compensation by undamaged orbital frontal cortex (O), an area also critical for DNMS, by comparing combined IC and O damage (Neo-ICO) with damage to O alone (Neo-O). Group Neo-ICO was impaired on DNMS learning at 3 months and 2 years of age. In contrast, Group Neo-O was impaired at 3 months, but recovered this function by 2 years, compared with Neo-IC and controls (N). We propose that the intact IC assumed the function of learning the DNMS rule for Group Neo-O. The persistent impairment after Neo-ICO lesions suggests that whereas O may likely support the rule acquisition in the absence of IC, no compensatory mechanisms are available after the combined damage. For the memory of lists of items, all groups were impaired at 3 months. At 2 years, the performance of Groups N and Neo-IC dramatically improved, whereas that of groups with O damage (Neo-O and Neo-ICO) remained impaired, indicating a critical role for O in recognition memory that cannot be substituted by another area.",lesion; memory; recognition; rhesus macaque; MATCHING-TO-SAMPLE; MEDIAL THALAMIC LESIONS; TEMPORAL-LOBE LESIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; VISUAL RECOGNITION; RHESUS-MONKEYS; PERIRHINAL CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEYS; PARAHIPPOCAMPAL CORTICES; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX

Using fMRI we performed a neck muscle vibration paradigm in humans in order to detect brain areas involved in processing changes of the head position in relation to the rest of the body. We identified a network of primary and secondary cortical areas: (I) regions that presumably receive direct proprioceptive thalamic input such as areas 3a, 2, S2 and the parieto-insular vestibular cortex (PIVC), (II) foci in the intraparietal sulcus, motor and premotor areas, and the frontal eye field (FEF). Activation of the former reflect early stages of proprioceptive processing, nevertheless these areas contain polysensory subdivisions such as area 3aNv, which also receives vestibular afferents. Together with area PIVC and the vestibular field in area 2 (2v), area 3aNv constitutes the inner vestibular circuit, an interconnected cortical triangle of polysensory areas that project to the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), which is known to be involved in polysensory integration. With respect to possible analogies in the monkey, we speculate that the activation we observed in the PPC is closely related to the LIP and VIP regions of the macaque. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

TorsinA immunoreactivity was visualized using a monoclonal antibody raised against a fusion protein encoding exon 4 of human torsinA. Western blot analysis of brain homogenates revealed a major species of about 39 kDa, consistent with the predicted size of glycosylated torsinA protein. By light microscopy, torsinA like-immunoreactivity was enriched in gray matter in all brain regions examined. Immunoreactivity was concentrated in the neuropil and immunopositive cell bodies were not observed. Structures particularly enriched in torsinA like-immunoreactivity included the cerebral cortex, the caudate-putamen, globus pallidus, the hippocampal formation, the thalamus, the substantia nigra and molecular cell layer of the cerebellar cortex. Cell bodies of pigmented dopamine neurons in the substantia nigra. pars compacta were immunonegative. Biochemical fractionation of the human striata revealed a concentration of torsinA immunoreactivity in particulate fractions. Ultrastructural studies of the human and Macaque striata further revealed an association of torsinA immunostaining with small vesicles within axons and presynaptic terminals forming symmetric synapses. These ultrastructural studies are consistent with a pre-synaptic localization of torsinA protein in the adult striatum and are consistent with a role of torsinA in modulating striatal signaling, although the widespread localization of the protein suggests it probably also participates in signaling in other regions.

Although recent years have seen a considerable rise in the use of rodents, particularly mice, to investigate PPC and related networks, a coherent anatomical definition of PPC in the mouse is still lacking. To address this, we delineated the mouse PPC, using cyto-and chemoarchitectural markers from Nissl-, parvalbumin-and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2-staining. Additionally, we performed bilateral triple anterograde tracer injections in primary visual cortex (V1) and prepared flattened tangential sections from one hemisphere and coronal sections from the other, allowing us to co-register the cytoarchitectural features of PPC with V1 projections. This revealed that extrastriate area A was largely contained within lateral PPC, that medial PPC overlapped with the anterior portion of area AM, and that anterior RL overlapped partially with area PtP. Furthermore, triple anterograde tracer injections in PPC showed strong projections to associative thalamic nuclei as well as higher visual areas, orbitofrontal, cingulate and secondary motor cortices. Retrograde circuit mapping with rabies virus further showed that all cortical connections were reciprocal. These combined approaches provide a coherent definition of mouse PPC that incorporates laminar architecture, extrastriate projections, thalamic, and cortico-cortical connections.",anatomy; cortico-cortical connectivity; frontal cortex; parietal cortex; prefrontal cortex; tract tracing; visual cortex; CORTICAL CONNECTIONS; THALAMOCORTICAL CONNECTIONS; FUNCTIONAL SPECIALIZATION; STRIATE CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; VISUAL-CORTEX; PROJECTIONS; MAPS; REPRESENTATION; INFORMATION

Via this pathway information from sensory, motor and associative areas of the cerebral cortex are routed to a variety of thalamocortical and brainstem networks involved in the organization of motor behaviour. In a previous analysis of the rat substantia nigra pars reticulata we have shown that the nigral cells which project to thalamus, tectum and tegmentum are topographically ordered along a series of curved laminae. Extending these observations, the present study examined how striatal regions related to particular areas of the cerebral cortex innervate the lamellar keyboard of nigral output neurons. For this purpose, small microiontophoretic injections of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase were performed in the striatum and the distribution of retrogradely-labelled cells in the cerebral cortex and anterogradely-labelled axons in the substantia nigra were conjointly examined. The results indicate that with the exception of the striatal region related to the allocortex, all the various components of the striatal functional mosaic art represented in the substantia nigra pars reticulata. This representation is organized under the form of longitudinal bands which compose a series of curved laminae enveloping a core located dorsolaterally in the substantia nigra. The striatal mapping in substantia nigra pars reticulata is such that the projections of the auditory and visual compartments are confined to the most ventral lamina. More dorsally, an ordered representation of the body is achieved by the nigral lamination. The oral and perioral body parts are centred on the dorsolateral core and the more distal parts of the face and limbs are progressively set out in more peripheral laminae. In the region affiliated to the prefrontal cortex, the dorsal cingulate district innervate a ventromedial lamina, the prelimbic:insular district lie dorsal to it. Projections from lateral orbital and insular compartments extend laterally along the dorsal margin of the pars reticulata. Since the ''onion-like'' distribution of striatal inputs is precisely the form observed in the distribution of nigral efferent neurons, the present observations favour the view that the nigral lamination underlies formation of specific input-output channels of processing. Evidence is considered that these channels are specialized for particular classes of movements or behaviours and integrate the various information relevant to the completion of these movements or behaviours.

Although these maturational changes in synaptic density have been observed across the cortical mantle, little is known about the precise time course of developmental refinements in synaptic inputs to specific populations of cortical neurons. We examined the postnatal development of two markers of excitatory and inhibitory inputs to a subpopulation of layer III pyramidal neurons in areas 9 and 46 of rhesus monkey prefrontal cortex. These neurons are of particular interest because they play a major role in the flow ofinformation both within and between cortical regions. Quantitative reconstructions of Golgi-impregnated mid-layer III pyramidal neurons revealed substantial developmental changes in the relative density of dendritic spines, the major site of excitatory inputs to these neurons. Relative spine density;on both the apical and basilar dendritic trees increased by 50% during the first two postnatal months, remained at a plateau through 1.5 years of age, and then decreased over the peripubertal age range until stable adult levels were achieved. As a measure of the postnatal changes in inhibitory input to the axon initial segment of these pyramidal neurons, we determined the density of parvalbumin-immunoreactive axon terminals belonging to the chandelier class of local circuit neurons. The density of these distinctive axon terminals (cartridges) exhibited a temporal pattern of change that exactly paralleled the changes in dendritic spine density. These results suggest that subpopulations of cortical neurons may be regulated by dynamic interactions between excitatory and inhibitory inputs during development and, in concert with other data, they emphasize the cellular specificity of postnatal refinements in cortical circuitry.",nan; PRIMATE CEREBRAL-CORTEX; CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEIN; SOMATIC SENSORY CORTEX; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; POSTNATAL-DEVELOPMENT; SYNAPTIC DENSITY; STELLATE NEURONS; MACAQUE MONKEY; MOTOR CORTEX; CORTICOTHALAMIC CELLS

Distribution and morphology of neurons projecting from posterior medial lateral suprasylvian sulcus to area 17,"Reciprocal projections between cortical areas have been subdivided into two functionally distinct components, ''feedforward'' and ''feedback'' (for review, see Felleman and Van Essen [1991] Cereb. Cortex 1:1-47). Some anatomical evidence, such as differences in the laminar distribution of the neurons of origin and of the terminations of their axons, has supported this division. However, very little is actually known about the distribution and morphology of the neurons of the feedback projections. In order to contribute further to our understanding of these two components of the corticocortical projections, I studied the distribution and morphology of a feedback projection, the reciprocal projection from the posterior medial lateral suprasylvian sulcus (PMLS), to primary visual cortex (area 17). Retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase and fluorescent tracers in vivo combined with intracellular dye injections in lightly fixed cortical slices revealed many similarities between the feedforward and feedback projections: 1) They both emanate from all layers but layer 1; 2) each layer of origin contains a wide variety of standard and/or inverted pyramidal neurons; and 3) all of these, with the exception of a rare, large layer 5 neuron, have dendritic fields restricted principally to their layers of origin. There was, however, one major difference between the feedforward and feedback projections: In contrast to the projection from area 17 to PMLS, the projection from PMLS had a dense projection from layer 6 that comprised a striking abundance of spiny fusiform and inverted pyramidal neurons. These were morphologically distinct from other layer 6 neurons that project to the thalamus. Taken together, these data suggest that the reciprocal projections between area 17 and area PMLS, although not completely equivalent, share essential features that form a distinct population of neurons differing in morphology from corticothalamic projection neurons.

Recent experimental reports have analyzed neurotransmitter signaling before the onset of synaptogenesis, which could act to influence early developmental events such as proliferation, migration, and differentiation of animal brain development. Such signaling may also occur in human development. The expression of molecules involved in neurotransmission in precocious human brain may reflect either the differentiation of a permanent neurotransmitter system of the adult brain or transient expression to serve specific developmental functions different from those in the adult brain. We review the changes observed in the expression of various catecholamine markers such as tyrosine-hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity in various neuronal populations of the developing human telencephalon. The specific transporter for serotonin, serotonin transporter (SERT) has been detected in fibers of the internal capsule (IC) during the restricted time period of 12-14 gestational weeks in humans. These serotonin-containing fibers do not correspond to serotoninergic ascending axons from the raphe nuclei. They may be the human counterpart of the thalamo-cortical axons that have been shown to uptake serotonin during the critical period of development of the sensory systems in rodents. GABA phenotypes are expressed in numerous cells of the human ganglionic eminence (GE) and cerebral wall at the end of the embryonic period proper. These results are similar to that described at comparable developmental stages in the mouse and support the hypothesis of an early migration from ganglionic progenitors in humans. But one cannot exclude a transient expression of GABA within the post-mitotic neurons, which could influence early developmental events. In conclusion, data showing the phenotypic expression of molecules in discrete areas of the brain at various points in the protracted human development require careful interpretation.

These effects seemed to be derived from the supplementary motor area (SMA). Event-related functional magnetic resonance imagery (fMRI) was used to check this hypothesis. Brain activations were contrasted in Time production and (control) Force production tasks involving left-hand responding. These tasks, presented in mixed order, were designed to be of equivalent difficulty and involve comparable levels of attention. Several brain areas were activated in both tasks relative to baseline: the SMA, the putamen, and the lateral cerebellum. Contrasts between tasks gave clear-cut differences. Activations specific to the Time task were found in the SMA proper and the left primary motor cortex. The Force task activated the right sensorimotor cortex and the left cerebellum, and, bilaterally, the infero-parietal cortex and the insula. The main result, i.e. prominent activation of the SMA proper in relation to temporal production, corroborates our previous studies based on slow cortical potentials. The data are referred to current evidence suggesting that timing processes are subtended by a striato-thalamo-cortical pathway including the SMA. (C) 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Here we report that these events correspond to momentary drops in cortical arousal and are associated with activity changes in the basal forebrain and thalamus. Combining fMRI and electrophysiology in macaques, we first establish that fMRI transients co-occur with spectral shifts in local field potentials (LFPs) toward low frequencies. Applying this knowledge to fMRI data from the human connectome project, we find that the fMRI transients are strongest in sensory cortices. Surprisingly, the positive cortical transients occur together with negative transients in focal subcortical areas known to be involved with arousal regulation, most notably the basal forebrain. This subcortical involvement, combined with the prototypical pattern of LFP spectral shifts, suggests that commonly observed widespread variations in fMRI cortical activity are associated with momentary drops in arousal.",nan; HUMAN CONNECTOME PROJECT; MONKEY VISUAL-CORTEX; GLOBAL SIGNAL; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BASAL FOREBRAIN; NUCLEUS BASALIS; ALPHA-RHYTHM; SPONTANEOUS FLUCTUATIONS; CHOLINERGIC INNERVATION; CIRCADIAN-RHYTHMS

While selective basal ganglia lesions (caudate and/or putamen exclusively) did not affect voluntary movements of the extremities, lesions of the anterior (plus caudate/putamen) or posterior limb of the internal capsule led to an initially severe motor impairment followed by excellent recovery, hand function included. In contrast, lesions of the posterior limb of the internal capsule in combination with damage to lateral thalamus compromised motor outcome. In experimental tracing of the topography of the internal capsule in macaque monkeys, we found axons of primary motor cortex passing through the middle third of the posterior limb of the internal capsule. Axons of premotor cortex (dorsolateral and post-arcuate area 6) passed through the capsular genu, and those of supplementary motor area (mesial area 6) through the anterior limb. Small capsular lesion can therefore disrupt the output of functionally and anatomically distinct motor areas selectively. The clinically similar motor deficits with a similar course of functional restitution following disruption of these different descending motor pathways indicate a parallel operation of cortical motor areas. They may have the further capability of substituting each other functionally in the process of recovery from hemiparesis.",nan; PYRAMIDAL TRACT; STRIATOCAPSULAR INFARCTION; CORTICOSPINAL PROJECTIONS; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY; INTERNAL CAPSULE; VASCULAR-LESIONS; INFERIOR AREA-6; MACAQUE MONKEY; FRONTAL-LOBE

The prefrontal cerebral cortex is thought to be critical to the performance of such behaviors, although the relative contribution of different components of this structure and associated subcortical regions are not fully understood. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure brain activity during a simple task which required repeated reversals of a rule linking a colored cue and a left/right motor response. Each trial comprised three discrete events separated by variable delay periods. A colored cue instructed which response was to be executed; followed by a go signal which told the subject to execute the response and a feedback instruction which indicated whether to hold or flip the rule linking the colored cue and response. The design allowed us to determine which brain regions were recruited by the specific demands of preparing a rule contingent motor response, executing such a response, evaluating the significance of the feedback, and reconfiguring stimulus-response (SR) associations. The results indicate that an increase in neural activity occurs within the anterior cingulate gyrus under conditions in which SR associations are labile. In contrast, lateral frontal regions are activated by unlikely/unexpected perceptual events regardless of their significance for behavior. A network of subcortical structures, including the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus and striatum were the only regions showing activity that was exclusively correlated with the neurocognitive demands of reversing SR associations. We conclude that lateral frontal regions act to evaluate the behavioral significance of perceptual events, whereas medial frontal-thalamic circuits are involved in monitoring and reconfiguring SR associations when necessary.",nan; COGNITIVE CONTROL; FRONTAL-CORTEX; WORKING-MEMORY; RHESUS-MONKEY; NEURAL ACTIVITY; FUNCTIONAL MRI; FMRI; ORGANIZATION; MECHANISMS; TRANSIENT

The temporal relationship between the occupancy level of central mAChRs and cognitive impairment was determined. Three conscious monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were subjected to positron emission tomography (PET) scans with the mAChR radioligand N-[C-11]methyl-3-piperidyl benzilate ([C-11](+)3-MPB). The scan sequence was pre-, 2, 6, 24, and 48 h post-intramuscular administration of scopolamine in doses of 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg. Occupancy levels of mAChR were maximal 2 h post-scopolamine in cortical regions innervated primarily by the basal forebrain, thalamus, and brainstem, showing that mAChR occupancy levels were 43-59 and 65-89% in doses of 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg, respectively. In addition, dose-dependent impairment of working memory performance was measured 2 h after scopolamine. A positive correlation between the mAChR occupancy and cognitive impairment 2 and 6 h post-scopolamine was the greatest in the brainstem (P < 0.00001). Although cognitive impairment was not observed 24 h post-scopolamine, sustained mAChR occupancy (11-24%) was found with both doses in the basal forebrain and thalamus, but not in the brainstem. These results indicate that a significant degree of mAChRs occupancy is needed to produce cognitive impairment by scopolamine. Furthermore, the importance of the brainstem cholinergic system in working memory in monkey is described.

These interactions occur via cortico-basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical loops. The putamen is one of the major sites of cortical input into basal ganglia loops and is frequently activated during pain. This activity has been typically associated with the processing of pain-related motor responses. However, the potential contribution of putamen to the processing of sensory aspects of pain remains poorly characterized. In order to more directly determine if the putamen can contribute to sensory aspects of pain, nine individuals with lesions involving the putamen underwent both psychophysical and functional imaging assessment of perceived pain and pain-related brain activation. These individuals exhibited intact tactile thresholds, but reduced heat pain sensitivity and widespread reductions in pain-related cortical activity in comparison with 14 age-matched healthy subjects. Using magnetic resonance imaging to assess structural connectivity in healthy subjects, we show that portions of the putamen activated during pain are connected not only with cortical regions involved in sensory-motor processing, but also regions involved in attention, memory and affect. Such a framework may allow cognitive information to flow from these brain areas to the putamen where it may be used to influence how nociceptive information is processed. Taken together, these findings indicate that the putamen and the basal ganglia may contribute importantly to the shaping of an individual subjective sensory experience by utilizing internal cognitive information to influence activity of large areas of the cerebral cortex.",basal ganglia; functional MRI; pain; stroke; selection; D2 RECEPTOR-BINDING; LAMINA-I NEURONS; BASAL GANGLIA; SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; FUNCTIONAL-ANATOMY; PERCEIVED PAIN; RHESUS-MONKEY; GRAY-MATTER; ORGANIZATION

Pulvinar neurons have been shown to integrate the component signals of a plaid pattern into a coherent global percept (pattern-motion selectivity). Using positron emission tomography (PET), we have investigated the possibility that the human pulvinar is also involved in plaid-defined higher-order motion integration. Plaid patterns were presented to normal observers in two conditions (coherent vs. transparent) created by varying the relative spatial frequency of the two gratings comprising the plaid. Regions of interest analysis revealed a significant activation of the pulvinar in the coherent condition supporting the notion that the human pulvinar nucleus is involved in higher-order motion processing. Plaid pattern activation was also observed in the media temporal gyrus (area MT/V5), a motion area with strong anatomical connections to the pulvinar. These data provide the first direct evidence that the human pulvinar is involved in complex motion integration, as previously shown in animal models, and further support the existence of cortico-thalamo-cortical computational networks involved in higher-order visual processing.

Previously, we have shown that the nonradioactive (R,R)-diastereomer displays an eightfold selectivity for M1 over M2 while the nonradioactive (R,S)-diastereomer displays a sevenfold selectivity for M2 over M1 in vitro. This paper reports the results of in vivo comparison studies. In the rat, uptake of (R,S)-[F-18]-FMeQNB was nearly uniform in all brain regions following the concentration of M2 subtype. The uptake was reduced by 36-54% in all brain regions on coinjection with 50 nmol of unlabeled ligand. An injection of (R,S)-[F-18]-FMeQNB followed at 60 min by injection of unlabeled ligand and subsequent sacrifice at 120 min displaced 30-50% of radioactivity in the pens, medulla, and cerebellum, which contain a high proportion of M2 subtype. The most dramatic displacement and inhibition of uptake on coinjection of (R,S)-[F-18]-FMeQNB was observed in the heart. In rhesus monkey, the compound showed prolonged uptake and retention in the brain. In the blood, the parent compound degraded rapidly to a single radiolabeled polar metabolite believed to be fluoride. Within 30 min the parent compound represented less than 5% of the plasma activity. Displacement with (R)-QNB was generally slow, but was more rapid from those tissues which contain a higher proportion of M2 subtype. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that (R,S)-[F-18]-FMeQNB is M2 selective in vivo. On the other hand, (R,R)-[F-18]-FMeQNB showed higher uptake in those brain regions containing a higher concentration of M1 subtype. Uptake in the heart at 60 min was much lower than that observed with the (R,S)-diastereomer. Inhibition of uptake on coinjection with unlabeled (R,S)-FMeQNB is only significant in the heart, thalamus, and pens. Inhibition of uptake on coinjection with unlabeled (R,R)-FMeQNB is quite uniform in all brain regions. Displacement with (R)-QNB shows a more varying amount displaced. These results are consistent with (R,R)-[F-18]-FMeQNB being M1 selective in vivo.

However, it is not clear whether visual consciousness should be uniquely localized in the temporal association cortex. Here we used binocular flash suppression to investigate whether visual awareness is also explicitly reflected in feature-selective neural activity of the macaque lateral prefrontal cortex (LPFC), a cortical area reciprocally connected to the temporal lobe. We show that neuronal discharges in the majority of single units and recording sites in the LPFC follow the phenomenal perception of a preferred stimulus. Furthermore, visual awareness is reliably reflected in the power modulation of high-frequency (>50 Hz) local field potentials in sites where spiking activity is found to be perceptually modulated.

Although numerous changes have been reported in local functional studies, few studies have reported on the anatomical network of the entire brain. Here, by developing a series of algorithms, this study provided a whole anatomical neural network of the macaque monkey. Then, the drifts in centrality from normal to PD networks were described in terms of complex network analysis and summarized with principal component analysis. Results revealed that the areas including the striatum, globus pallidus, amygdala, prefrontal lobe, thalamus, hippocampus, visual cortex, insula, etc., showed relatively notable drifts in their own patterns. The present study also demonstrated that the current targets of DBS shared a common feature: their centrality values being relatively low in the normal brain while intensely drifting with PD.

The high affinity, K-D = 30 pM, makes it a suitable candidate for visualizing both striatal and extrastriatal binding in the brain. In this work, dynamic PET studies of two macaque monkeys were acquired along with arterial plasma samples. Compartmental analysis and Logan plots were used to analyze the striatum, thalamus, frontal, and temporal cortices and to validate a reference region of analysis which yields a distribution volume ratio (DVR). The cerebellum was used as the reference region. The results indicate that all methods of analysis are in close agreement over all the analyzed regions in the brain. The average DVRs for the two monkeys was found to be: caudate = 26, putamen = 29, thalamus = 3.8, frontal ctx = 1.7, and temporal ctx = 1.7 on a high-resolution PET scanner. It was found that a scan time of 2 h is needed to accurately estimate the DVR for all regions of the brain. The striatal regions require the longest to linearize and are the most sensitive to variations in time average tissue-to-plasma efflux constant, (k) over bar(2). For the extrastriatal regions, the effect of the (k) over bar(2) term on DVR calculation is negligible. Repeatability measurements for all regions were found to be within 10% using the DVR parameter.

We hypothesize that these waves are the predominant physiological process reflected in spontaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal fluctuations. The correlation structure (functional connectivity) of these fluctuations recapitulates the large-scale functional organization of the brain. However, a unifying physiological account of this structure has so far been lacking. Here, using fMRI in humans, we show that ongoing arousal fluctuations are associated with global waves of activity that slowly propagate in parallel throughout the neocortex, thalamus, striatum, and cerebellum. We show that these waves can parsimoniously account for many features of spontaneous fMRI signal fluctuations, including topographically organized functional connectivity.

The rate at which they made the movements was significantly reduced postoperatively, but their performance on a visually cued control task was normal. It is argued that the impairment was not a consequence of poor motor control or motivation, but that it reflected a reduced capacity to recall learned movements in the absence of external cues.

Positron emission tomography (PET) studies in humans have shown that the caudal ventrolateral midbrain, encompassing the ventrolateral PAG, has activations during migraine attacks. The PAG may well be involved not only through the descending modulation of nociceptive afferent information, but also by its ascending projections to the pain processing centres of the thalamus. In this study the intranuclear oncogene protein Fos was used to mark cell activation in the PAG following stimulation of the trigeminally-innervated superior sagittal sinus (SSS) in both cats and in nonhuman primates (Macaca nemestrina). Fos expression in the PAG increased following stimulation to a median of 242 cells (interquartile range 236-272) in the cat and 155 cells (range 104-203) in the monkey, compared with control levels of 35 cells (21-50) and 26 cells (18-33), respectively.

Some studies have suggested that functional and structural impairments in the default mode network may play a role in explaining these disorders. In contrast, others have proposed that dysfunctions in the anterior forebrain mesocircuit involving striatum, globus pallidus, and thalamus may be the main underlying mechanism. Here, we provide the first report of structural integrity of fiber tracts connecting the nodes of the mesocircuit and the default mode network in 8 patients with DOC. We found evidence of significant damage to subcortico-cortical and cortico-cortical fibers, which were more severe in vegetative state patients and correlated with clinical severity as determined by Coma Recovery Scale-Revised (CRS-R) scores. In contrast, fiber tracts interconnecting subcortical nodes were not significantly impaired. Lastly, we found significant damage in all fiber tracts connecting the precuneus with cortical and subcortical areas. Our results suggest a strong relationship between the default mode network and most importantly the precuneus - and the anterior forebrain mesocircuit in the neural basis of the DOC.

Cerebral in-vivo mapping of glucose metabolism has been studied in severe stable parkinsonian monkeys, but data on brain metabolic changes in early stages of dopaminergic depletion of this model is lacking. Here, we report cerebral metabolic changes associated with progressive nigrostriatal lesion in the pre-symptomatic and symptomatic stages of the progressive 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) monkey model of Parkinson's Disease. Monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) received MPTP injections biweekly to induce progressive grades of dopamine depletion. Monkeys were sorted according to motor scale assessments in control, asymptomatic, recovered, mild, and severe parkinsonian groups. Dopaminergic depletion in the striatum and cerebral metabolic patterns across groups were studied in vivo by positron emission tomography (PET) using monoaminergic ([C-11]-dihydrotetrabenazine; C-11-DTBZ) and metabolic (2-[F-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose; F-18-FDG) radiotracers. C-11-DTBZ-PET analysis showed progressive decrease of binding potential values in the striatum of monkeys throughout MPTP administration and the development of parkinsonian signs. F-18-FDG analysis in asymptomatic and recovered animals showed significant hypometabolism in temporal and parietal areas of the cerebral cortex in association with moderate dopaminergic nigrostriatal depletion. Cortical hypometabolism extended to involve a larger area in mild parkinsonian monkeys, which also exhibited hypermetabolism in the globus pallidum pars interna and cerebellum. In severe parkinsonian monkeys, cortical hypometabolism extended further to lateral-frontal cortices and hypermetabolism also ensued in the thalamus and cerebellum. Unbiased histological quantification of neurons in Brodmann's area 7 in the parietal cortex did not reveal neuron loss in parkinsonian monkeys versus controls. Early dopaminergic nigrostriatal depletion is associated with cortical, mainly temporo-parietal hypometabolism unrelated to neuron loss. These findings, together with recent evidence from Parkinson's Disease patients, suggest that early cortical hypometabolism may be associated and driven by subcortical changes that need to be evaluated appropriately. Altogether, these findings could be relevant when potential disease modifying therapies become available.",Parkinson's disease; Positron emission tomography (PET); [F-18]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (F-18-FDG); [C-11]-dihydrotetrabenazine (C-11-DTBZ); Glucose metabolism; NETWORK ACTIVITY; RHESUS-MONKEY; DISEASE; PET; DOPAMINE; C-11-(+)-ALPHA-DIHYDROTETRABENAZINE; MECHANISMS; DIAGNOSIS; SYMPTOMS; THERAPY

Different lesions are applied to the model in order to investigate the working memory deficits observed in Parkinson's disease and schizophrenia. The simulations predict that the working memory deficits observed in Parkinson's disease result from a local dysfunction within the brain due to a problem in the disinhibitory process arising from the basal ganglia. They also predict that the working memory deficits observed in schizophrenia involve many cortical and subcortical areas and result from a problem in selecting items in working memory which are stored in basal ganglia-thalamocortical loops. The simulations predict the temporal unfolding of neuronal activity in different brain regions, both in the normal case and in the two disease states. A specific event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging study was elaborated to test some of those predictions. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Moreover, dopaminergic projections and D-1/D-5 receptor distributions display a layer-dependent organization, suggesting specific functions in the cortical circuitry. However, the circuit effects of dopaminergic neurotransmission in sensory cortex and their possible roles in perception, learning, and memory are largely unknown. Here, we investigated layer-specific circuit effects of dopaminergic neuromodulation using current source density (CSD) analysis in AI of Mongolian gerbils. Pharmacological stimulation of D1/D5 receptors increased auditory-evoked synaptic currents in infragranular layers, prolonging local thalamocortical input via positive feedback between infragranular output and granular input. Subsequently, dopamine promoted sustained cortical activation by prolonged recruitment of long-range corticocortical networks. A detailed circuit analysis combining layer-specific intracortical microstimulation (ICMS), CSD analysis, and pharmacological cortical silencing revealed that cross-laminar feedback enhanced by dopamine relied on a positive, fast-acting recurrent corticoefferent loop, most likely relayed via local thalamic circuits. Behavioral signal detection analysis further showed that activation of corticoefferent output by infragranular ICMS, which mimicked auditory activation under dopaminergic influence, was most effective in eliciting a behaviorally detectable signal. Our results show that D-1/D-5-mediated dopaminergic modulation in sensory cortex regulates positive recurrent corticoefferent feedback, which enhances states of high, persistent activity in sensory cortex evoked by behaviorally relevant stimuli. In boosting horizontal network interactions, this potentially promotes the readout of task-related information from cortical synapses and improves behavioral stimulus detection.",auditory cortex; behavior; corticoefferent recurrence; dopamine; perception; PRIMARY AUDITORY-CORTEX; MEMORY CONSOLIDATION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; VISUAL-CORTEX; ELECTRICAL MICROSTIMULATION; SPECTRAL INTEGRATION; CORTICAL ACTIVITY; STRIATE CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY

This study applied more stringent behavioural and cognitive controls than previously used for similar experiments: (i) subjects were included only if they showed evidence of attentional shifts while performing the task in the magnet; (ii) the experimental task and baseline condition were designed to eliminate the contributions of motor output, visual fixation, inhibition of eye movements, working memory and the conditional (no-go) component of responding, Activations were seen in all three hypothesized cortical epicentres forming a network for spatial attention: the lateral premotor cortex (frontal eye fields), the posterior parietal cortex and the cingulate cortex, Subcortical activations were seen in the basal ganglia and the thalamus, Although the task required attention to be equally shifted to the left and to the right, eight of 10 subjects showed a greater area of activation in the right parietal cortex, consistent with the specialization of the right hemisphere for spatial attention, Other areas of significant activation included the posterior temporo-occipital cortex and the anterior insula, The temporo-occipital activation was within a region broadly defined as MT+ (where MT is the middle temporal area) which contains the human equivalent of area MT in the macaque monkey, This temporo-occipital area appears to constitute a major component of the functional network activated by this spatial attention task, Its activation may reflect the 'inferred' shift of the attentional focus across the visual scene.",attention; hemispheric dominance; networks; spatial orientation; SACCADIC EYE-MOVEMENTS; POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; HUMAN VISUAL-CORTEX; FMRI TIME-SERIES; FUNCTIONAL-ANATOMY; VISUOSPATIAL ATTENTION; WORKING-MEMORY; RHESUS-MONKEY

Although the basic structure is similar for each cortical area, specialized neural connections likely mediate unique information processing requirements. Relative to primary visual (V1) and somatosensory (S1) cortices, little is known about the intrinsic connectivity of primary auditory cortex (A1). To better understand the flow of information from the thalamus to and through rat A1, we made use of a rapid, high-throughput screening method exploiting laser-induced uncaging of glutamate to construct excitatory input maps of individual neurons. We found that excitatory inputs to layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons were similar to those in V1 and S1; these cells received strong excitation primarily from layers 2-4. Both anatomical and physiological observations, however, indicate that inputs and outputs of layer 4 excitatory neurons in A1 contrast with those in V1 and S1. Layer 2/3 pyramids in A1 have substantial axonal arbors in layer 4, and photostimulation demonstrates that these pyramids can connect to layer 4 excitatory neurons. Furthermore, most or all of these layer 4 excitatory neurons project out of the local cortical circuit. Unlike S1 and V1, where feedback to layer 4 is mediated exclusively by indirect local circuits involving layer 2/3 projections to deep layers and deep feedback to layer 4, layer 4 of A1 integrates thalamic and strong layer 4 recurrent excitatory input with relatively direct feedback from layer 2/3 and provides direct cortical output.",auditory cortex; rat; lamina; column; glutamate; synapse; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; INTRINSIC FIRING PATTERNS; CELL-TYPE SPECIFICITY; BARREL CORTEX; PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; NEOCORTICAL NEURONS; LAMINAR SPECIFICITY; AXONAL PROJECTIONS; RHESUS-MONKEY

We are interested in questions about the processing of communication calls and their representation within the mammalian auditory cortex. Our studies compare in particular two species for which a large body of data has accumulated: the mustached bat and the rhesus monkey. We conclude that the brains of both species share a number of functional and organizational principles, which differ only in the extent to which and how they are implemented. For instance, neurons in both species use combination-sensitivity (nonlinear spectral and temporal integration of stimulus components) as a basic mechanism to enable exquisite sensitivity to and selectivity for particular call types. Whereas combination-sensitivity is already found abundantly at the primary auditory cortical and also at subcortical levels in bats, it becomes prevalent only at the level of the lateral belt in the secondary auditory cortex of monkeys. A parallel-hierarchical framework for processing complex sounds up to the level of the auditory cortex in bats and an organization into parallel-hierarchical, cortico-cortical auditory processing streams in monkeys is another common principle. Response specialization of neurons seems to be more pronounced in bats than in monkeys, whereas a functional specialization into what and where streams in the cerebral cortex is more pronounced in monkeys than in bats. These differences, in part, are due to the increased number and larger size of auditory areas in the parietal and frontal cortex in primates. Accordingly, the computational prowess of neural networks and the functional hierarchy resulting in specializations is established early and accelerated across brain regions in bats. The principles proposed here for the neural management of species-specific calls in bats and primates can be tested by studying the details of call processing in additional species. Also, computational modeling in conjunction with coordinated studies in bats and monkeys can help to clarify the fundamental question of perceptual invariance (or constancy) in call recognition, which has obvious relevance for understanding speech perception and its disorders in humans.",language; speech; neural coding; bats; primates; review; COMBINATION-SENSITIVE NEURONS; FREQUENCY-MODULATED SOUNDS; RHESUS-MONKEY; MOUSTACHED BAT; RELATIONAL INVARIANCE; NEURAL REPRESENTATION; THALAMIC PROJECTIONS; RHINOLOPHUS-ROUXI; CORTICAL-NEURONS; NATURAL STIMULI

Patients are afflicted primarily with progressive central nervous system (CNS) dysfunction. Studies in mice, cats, and sheep have indicated safety and widespread distribution of Hex in the CNS after intracranial vector infusion of AAVrh8 vectors encoding species-specific Hex alpha- or beta-subunits at a 1: 1 ratio. Here, a safety study was conducted in cynomolgus macaques (cm), modeling previous animal studies, with bilateral infusion in the thalamus as well as in left lateral ventricle of AAVrh8 vectors encoding cm Hex alpha- and beta-subunits. Three doses (3.2 x 10(12) vg [n= 3]; 3.2 x 10(11) vg [n= 2]; or 1.1 x 10(11) vg [n= 2]) were tested, with controls infused with vehicle (n= 1) or transgene empty AAVrh8 vector at the highest dose (n= 2). Most monkeys receiving AAVrh8-cmHexa/b developed dyskinesias, ataxia, and loss of dexterity, with higher dose animals eventually becoming apathetic. Time to onset of symptoms was dose dependent, with the highest-dose cohort producing symptoms within a month of infusion. One monkey in the lowest-dose cohort was behaviorally asymptomatic but had magnetic resonance imaging abnormalities in the thalami. Histopathology was similar in all monkeys injected with AAVrh8cm-Hex alpha/beta, showing severe white and gray matter necrosis along the injection track, reactive vasculature, and the presence of neurons with granular eosinophilic material. Lesions were minimal to absent in both control cohorts. Despite cellular loss, a dramatic increase in Hex activity was measured in the thalamus, and none of the animals presented with antibody titers against Hex. The high overexpression of Hex protein is likely to blame for this negative outcome, and this study demonstrates the variations in safety profiles of AAVrh8-Hex alpha/beta intracranial injection among different species, despite encoding for self-proteins.",Tay-Sachs disease; hexosaminidase; intracranial delivery; adeno-associated virus; gene therapy; AAV; REDUCES LYSOSOMAL STORAGE; NERVOUS-SYSTEM DISEASE; GENE-THERAPY; LONG-TERM; SINGLE INJECTION; SANDHOFF-DISEASE; FELINE MODEL; MOUSE-BRAIN; VECTOR; DELIVERY

Visual responses were recorded from neurones in the magnocellular and parvocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus in two species of New World monkeys - the diurnal squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus) and the nocturnal owl monkey (Aotus trivirgatis). Recording sites were reconstructed in postmortem tissue and comparisons were made between the response properties of magnocellular and parvocellular neurones. 2. Receptive fields were characterized with both white noise and drifting gratings. We found that most of the differences between magnocellular and parvocellular neurones that have been described in the macaque monkey hold for the squirrel monkey and owl monkey. In squirrel monkey and owl monkey, receptive fields of magnocellular neurones were larger than those of parvocellular neurones at similar eccentricities. Although visual responses in the owl monkey were significantly slower than in the squirrel monkey, in both species magnocellular neurones differed from parvocellular neurones in that their responses (1) had higher contrast gains, (2) tended to peak at higher temporal frequencies (but with considerable overlap), (3) had shorter response latencies, and (4) were more transient. 3. The strength of a neurone's receptive-field surround was assessed by comparing neuronal responses to gratings of optimal spatial frequency with responses to gratings of low spatial frequency. Using this approach, receptive-field surrounds were found to be equally strong on average for magnocellular and parvocellular neurones. 4. Spatial summation, as measured by a null test, was linear for all magnocellular and parvocellular cells tested; that is, Y cells were not observed in either species. Finally, most magnocellular neurones showed a contrast gain control mechanism, although this was not seen for parvocellular neurones.",nan; RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; MARMOSET CALLITHRIX-JACCHUS; RECEPTIVE-FIELD PROPERTIES; LAMINAR ORGANIZATION; PRIMATE RETINA; GALAGO-CRASSICAUDATUS; CONTRAST-SENSITIVITY; RHESUS-MONKEY; COLOR-VISION; BUSH BABY

Tic generation has been linked to disturbed networks of brain areas involved in planning, controlling and execution of actions, particularly structural and functional disorders in the striatum and cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loops. We therefore applied structural diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to characterize changes in intrahemispheric white matter connectivity in cortico-subcortical circuits engaged in motor control in 15 GTS patients without psychiatric comorbidities. White matter connectivity was analyzed by probabilistic fiber tractography between 12 pre-defined cortical and subcortical regions of interest. Connectivity values were combined with measures of clinical severity rated by the Yale Global Tic Severity Scale (YGTSS). GTS patients showed widespread structural connectivity deficits. Lower connectivity values were found specifically in tracts connecting the supplementary motor areas (SMA) with basal ganglia (pre-SMA-putamen, SMA-putamen) and in frontal cortico-cortical circuits. There was an overall trend towards negative correlations between structural connectivity in these tracts and YGTSS scores. Structural connectivity of frontal brain networks involved in planning, controlling and executing actions is reduced in adult GTS patients which is associated with tic severity. These findings are in line with the concept of GTS as a neurodevelopmental disorder of brain immaturity. (C) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

However, the spatial organization of the connections that link digit representations of areas 3b with other somatosensory areas is less understood. Here we examined the cortical inputs to individual digit representations of area 3b in four squirrel monkeys and one prosimian galago. Retrograde tracers were injected into neurophysiologically defined representations of individual digits of area 3b. Cortical tissues were cut parallel to the surface in some cases and showed that feedback projections to individual digits overlapped extensively in the hand representations of areas 3b, 1, and parietal ventral (PV) and second somatosensory (S2) areas. Other regions with overlapping populations of labeled cells included area 3a and primary motor cortex (M1). The results were confirmed in other cases in which the cortical tissues were cut in the coronal plane. The same cases also showed that cells were primarily labeled in the infragranular and supragranular layers. Thus, feedback projections to individual digit representations in area 3b mainly originate from multiple digits and other portions of hand representations of areas 3b, 1, PV, and S2. This organization is in stark contrast to the segregated thalamocortical inputs, which originate in single digit representations and terminate in the matching digit representation in the cortex. The organization of feedback connections could provide a substrate for the integration of information across the representations of adjacent digits in area 3b. J. Comp. Neurol. 521:3768-3790, 2013.

PM participates in integrative and modulatory functions, including directed attention, and consistently exhibits alterations in disorders such as schizophrenia and autism. Despite essential cognitive functions, the cortical inputs to the PM have not been systematically investigated. To date, less than 20 cortices have been demonstrated to project to PM. The goal of this study was to establish a comprehensive map of the cortical afferents to PM in the marmoset monkey. Using a magnetic resonance imaging-guided injection approach, we reveal 62 discrete cortices projecting to the adult marmoset PM. We confirmed previously reported connections and identified further projections from discrete cortices across the temporal, parietal, retrosplenial-cingulate, prefrontal, and orbital lobes. These regions encompass areas recipient of PM efferents, demonstrating the reciprocity of the PM-cortical connectivity. Moreover, our results indicate that PM neurones projecting to distinct cortices are intermingled and form multimodal cell clusters. This microunit organization, believed to facilitate cross-modal integration, contrasts with the large functional subdivisions usually observed in thalamic nuclei. Altogether, we provide the first comprehensive map of PM cortical afferents, an essential stepping stone in expanding our knowledge of PM and its function.",connectivity; cortex; neural tracing; nonhuman primate; pulvinar; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; THALAMIC CONNECTIONS; INFERIOR PARIETAL; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; CINGULATE CORTEX; AUDITORY-CORTEX; ORGANIZATION; PROJECTIONS

Currently, there are no effective therapies for this disease. Previously, we have shown that RNA interference mediated silencing of ATXN1 mRNA provides therapeutic benefit in mouse models of the disease. Adeno-associated viral delivery of an engineered microRNA targeting ATXN1 to the cerebella of well-established mouse models improved motor phenotypes, neuropathy, and transcriptional changes. Here, we test the translatability of this approach in adult rhesus cerebella. Nine adult male and three adult female rhesus macaque were unilaterally injected with our therapeutic vector, a recombinant adeno-associated virus type 1 (rAAV1) expressing our RNAi trigger (miS1) and co-expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein (rAAV1.miS1eGFP) into the deep cerebellar nuclei using magnetic resonance imaging guided techniques combined with a Stealth Navigation system (Medtronics Inc.). Transduction was evident in the deep cerebellar nuclei, cerebellar Purkinje cells, the brainstem and the ventral lateral thalamus. Reduction of endogenous ATXN1 messenger RNA levels were a parts per thousand yen30% in the deep cerebellar nuclei, the cerebellar cortex, inferior olive, and thalamus relative to the uninjected hemisphere. There were no clinical complications, and quantitative and qualitative analyses suggest that this therapeutic intervention strategy and subsequent reduction of ATXN1 is well tolerated.

However, when simulations are conducted on models with sufficient biophysical details, great challenges arise from limited computer power, thereby restricting most existing computational works with biophysical models only to small-scale networks. On the other hand, with the emergence of powerful computing platforms, many recent works are geared to performing large-scale simulations with simple spiking models. However, the applicability of those works is limited by the nature of the underlying phenomenological model. To bridge the gap, an intermediate step is taken to construct a scalable brain model with sufficient biophysical details. In this work, great efforts are devoted to taking into account not only local cortical microcircuits but also the global brain architecture, and efficient techniques are proposed and adopted to address the associated computational challenges in simulation of networks of such complexity. With the customized simulator developed, we are able to simulate the brain model to generate not only sleep spindle and delta waves but also the spike-and-wave pattern of absence seizures, and directly link those behaviors to underlying biophysical mechanism. Those initial results are interesting because they show the possibility to determine underlying causes of diseases by simulating the biologically realistic brain model. With further development, the work is geared to assisting the clinicians in selecting the optimal treatment on an individual basis in the future. (c) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

Despite the clinical need to understand the neuronal bases of hand function recovery after spinal and/or nerve injuries, relatively few groups have systematically related subtle changes in voluntary hand use following injury to neuronal mechanisms in the monkey. Human and macaque hand anatomy and function are strikingly similar, which makes the macaque the favored nonhuman primate model for the study of postinjury dexterity. In this review of monkey models of cervical spinal injury that have successfully related voluntary hand use to neuronal responses during the early postinjury months, the focus is on the dorsal rhizotomy ( or dorsal rootlet lesion) model developed and used in our laboratory over the last several years. The review also describes macaque monkey models of injuries to the more central cervical spine (e. g., hemisection, dorsal column) that illustrate methods to assess postlesion hand function and that relate it to neurophysiological and neuro-anatomical changes. Such models are particularly important for understanding what the sensorimotor pathways are capable of, and for assessing the outcome of therapeutic interventions as they are developed.",cervical spinal cord; dexterity; dorsal rhizotomy; dorsal root lesion; hand function; monkey; neuronal plasticity; nonhuman primate; precision grip; sensorimotor function; EXPERIENCE-DEPENDENT PLASTICITY; CEREBRAL-ARTERY OCCLUSION; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; FASCICULUS-CUNEATUS; MACAQUE MONKEY; BRAIN-STEM; CORTICAL REORGANIZATION; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; DENDRITIC PLASTICITY; THALAMIC PROJECTIONS

Specifically, we were interested in the timing relationship between axon outgrowth and known temporal patterns of neurogenesis in the LGN and striate cortex. Ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) were selected for study because of their immature developmental state in late gestation and relatively large litters. We examined axon outgrowth from the retina, and anlagen of presumptive LGN and striate cortex between embryonic day 21-30 (E21-E30) using in situ inoculations of two fluorescent lipophilic dyes, Dil and DiA. Dil inoculations were made into the cortex and contralateral thalamus, and DiA inoculations were made into the contralateral eye. Retinal axon termination zones in the diencephalon following the DiA inoculations were used to validate the location of the LGN. Visual cortex and LGN neurogenesis begins at E20 in ferrets. No axon outgrowth could be documented from retina or anlagen of striate cortex and LGN until E24. At E24 some retinal axons reach and cross the chiasm, cortical axons extend some distance within the cortical radiations, and thalamic axons are within the internal capsule. Retinogeniculate, geniculocortical, and corticogeniculate axons extend to their target structures by E27, as evidenced by retrograde labeling in cells of origin. These data suggest that in the ferret retina, and developing LGN and striate cortex, (1) axon outgrowth from each visual area begins within 24-h of each other, after neurogenesis has begun at the source but before it is complete in the target; (2) axons may be generated before parent cell bodies have completed migration; and (3) arriving axons are in a position to influence target structures almost from their inception.",NEUROGENESIS; AXON OUTGROWTH; FETUS; MAMMAL; VISUAL SYSTEM; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; CATS RETINOGENICULATE PATHWAY; WALLABY MACROPUS-EUGENII; POSTNATAL-DEVELOPMENT; ANATOMICAL ORGANIZATION; RHESUS-MONKEY; CORTEX; NEURONS; GENESIS; PROJECTIONS

Positron emission tomography (PET) measurements with [C-11](R)-MeQAA, [C-11]PIB, and [F-18]BCPP-EF were conducted in monkeys in a conscious condition. [C-11](R)-MeQAA binding was analyzed by a simplified reference tissue model to calculate nondisplaceable binding potential (BPND), [C-11]PIB uptake was calculated by standard uptake value ratio (SUVR), and [F-18]BCPP-EF binding was determined by Logan graphical analysis to calculate total distribution volume (V-T) with arterial blood sampling. Higher brain uptake was determined in the thalamus, hippocampus, striatum, and cortical regions for [C-11](R)-MeQAA, while being lower in the cerebellum. Significant age-related reduction of [C-11](R)-MeQAA binding to 7-nAChR was determined only in the occipital cortex. The plot of Vt of [F-18]BCPP-EF against BPND of [C-11](R)-MeQAA indicated a significant negative correlation in the hippocampus and cortical regions in aged animals. Plotting of SUVR of [C-11]PIB against BPND of [C-11](R)-MeQAA showed a positive correlation. The in vivo binding of [C-11](R)-MeQAA could reflect the upregulation of 7-nAChR induced by neurodegenerative damage determined by A deposition as well as impaired MC-I activity in living brain.

The dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNC) fire in relation to primary rewards and reward-conditioned stimuli, but not to rewards that are expected. It has been hypothesized that the anatomical framework for the selective response of these neurons is organized in the projections from some paralimbic areas in the frontal robe to the striosomes of the caudate nucleus, which are also directly connected with the dopaminergic neurons of the SNC. Here, we present two additional pathways that may be related with this neurophysiological finding. We hypothesize that the connections of the paralimbic cortices with the ventral system of the basal ganglia and then with the thalamus and the hypothalamus, and the circuit ventral striatum-substantia nigra pars reticulata-thalamus-striatum could be also involved in the reward-based learning.

Primates have traditionally been used in these studies because of their ability to perform more complex behaviors closely akin to those of humans, a desirable prerequisite since our ultimate aim is to elucidate the neuronal correlates of human behaviors. A wealth of knowledge has accumulated on the sensory and motor systems such as vision, audition, and eye movements. For more demanding behaviors where the main focus has been on attention, recordings in awake primates have begun to yield valuable data on the centers of the brain that are reactive to different attributes of this behavior. As a result, various hypotheses of the origin and distribution of attentional effects have evolved. For instance, visual attentional effects have been described not only in the higher cortical area (W) but also in areas earlier in the visual pathway which presumably involve a feedback mechanism in the latter region. Here we outline the ways in which we have successfully used these methods to make single-cell recordings in awake macaques to show how certain behavioral paradigms affect neurons of the thalamus (with emphasis on the lateral geniculate nucleus). As we have done with established techniques these methods can be readily adapted to incorporate most behaviors needed to be tested and allow recordings to be made in virtually any part of the brain.

First published April 13, 2011; doi:10.1152/jn.00327.2010.-Invasive microelectrode recordings measure neuronal spikes, which are commonly considered inaccessible through standard surface electroencephalogram (EEG). Yet high-frequency EEG potentials (hf-EEG, f > 400 Hz) found in somatosensory evoked potentials of primates may reflect the mean population spike responses of coactivated cortical neurons. Since cortical responses to electrical nerve stimulation vary strongly from trial to trial, we investigated whether the hf-EEG signal can also echo single-trial variability observed at the single-unit level. We recorded extracellular single-unit activity in the primary somatosensory cortex of behaving macaque monkeys and identified variable spike burst responses following peripheral stimulation. Each of these responses was classified according to the timing of its spike constituents, conforming to one of a discrete set of spike patterns. We here show that these spike patterns are accompanied by variations in the concomitant epidural hf-EEG. These variations cannot be explained by fluctuating stimulus efficacy, suggesting that they were generated within the thalamocortical network. As high-frequency EEG signals can also be reliably recorded from the scalp of human subjects, they may provide a noninvasive window on fluctuating cortical spike activity in humans.",electroencephalogram; somatosensory cortex; spike patterns; single-unit activity; SOMATOSENSORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; HZ ELECTRICAL OSCILLATIONS; LOCAL-FIELD POTENTIALS; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; INHIBITORY INTERNEURONS; SEP COMPONENTS; GAMMA-BAND; SYNCHRONIZATION; STIMULATION; VARIABILITY

Three monkeys were trained to grasp an unseen instrumented object between the thumb and index finger and to lift and hold it stationary within a position window for 2-2.5 s. The grip and load forces and the object displacement were measured on each trial. Sin.-le-unit activity was recorded from the hand regions in the PMv and PMd. In some conditions a predictable perturbation was applied to the object after 1,500 ms of static holding, whereas in other conditions different random combinations of perturbed and unperturbed trials were given. In the perturbed conditions, some were randomly and intermittently presented with a warning flash, whereas some were unsignaled. The activities of 198 cells were modulated during the task performance. Of these cells, 151 were located in the PMv, and 47 were located in the PMd. Although both PMv and PMd neurons had similar discharge patterns, more PMd neurons (84 vs. 43%) showed early pregrip activity. Forty of 106 PMv and 10/30 PMd cells responded to the perturbation with reflexlike triggered reactions. The latency of this response was always <100 ms with a mean of about 55 ms in both the PMv and the PMd. In contrast, 106 PMv and 30 PMd cells tested with the perturbations, only 9 and 10%, respectively, showed significant but nonspecific adaptations to the perturbation. The warning stimulus did not increase the occurrence of specific responses to the perturbation even though 21 of 42 cells related to the grip task also responded to moving visual stimuli. The responses were retinal and frequently involved limited portions of both foveal and peripheral visual fields. When tested with a 75 x 5.5-cm dark bar on a light background, these cells were sensitive to the direction of movement. In summary, the periarcuate premotor area activity to related to predictable force-pulse perturbations seems to reflect a general increase in excitability in contrast to a more specific anticipatory activity such as recorded in the cerebellum. In spite of the strong cerebello-thalamo-cortical projections, the results of the present study suggest that the cortical premotor areas are not involved in the elaboration of adaptive internal models of hand-object dynamics.",nan; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; MOVEMENT-RELATED ACTIVITY; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; MACAQUE MONKEY; MOTOR CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; CINGULATE CORTEX; FRONTAL-CORTEX; ARM MOVEMENTS; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX

New restorative therapies for Parkinson disease, aimed at delivering drugs or cells to the substantia nigra (SN), are becoming available. Therefore, precise surgical approaches to the dopaminergic cell-containing region of the SN are required to avoid damage to nearby structures such as the corticospinal tract and subthalamic nucleus. In a study conducted in nonhuman primates, the authors evaluated the utility and accuracy of electrophysiological techniques in localizing the SN. Three adult rhesus monkeys were used as hosts for intranigal cell transplants. The monkeys were rendered hemiparkinsonian by intracarotid injection of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. With the aid of stereotactic guidance, chronic recording chambers were placed on the skull of each monkey and directed at the SN. In each monkey, 20 to 40 trajectories were explored with a microelectrode. Spontaneous and movement-related single-unit activities were recorded in the SN, pars reticulata, subthalamic nucleus, globus pallidus, striatum, thalamus, and red nucleus. Motor and ocular responses to microstimulation in the subthalamic area were noted. Using the electrophysiological and stereotactic information that was obtained, three-dimensional maps of the nigral complex were constructed to infer the location of the SN pars compacta. The maps were subsequently used to guide intranigral placement of fetal dopaminergic cells. Accurate delivery was verified by histological analysis. Based on the characteristic electrophysiological properties of the SN and surrounding structures in the parkinsonian state, microelectrode recording techniques may be used to ensure accurate placement of cell transplantation in the intranigral.",substantia nigra; subthalamic nucleus; Parkinson disease; microelectrode recording; basal ganglia; cell transplantation; Macaca mulatta; DEEP-BRAIN-STIMULATION; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS STIMULATION; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; PALLIDAL NEURONS; GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; PARS RETICULATA; DISEASE; MPTP; MONKEYS

It has been thought that the thalamus prevents the relay of sensory information to cortex during sleep, but the consequences for cortical responses to sensory signals in this physiological state remain unclear. We recorded from two auditory cortical areas downstream of the thalamus in naturally sleeping marmoset monkeys. Single neurons in primary auditory cortex either increased or decreased their responses during sleep compared with wakefulness. In lateral belt, a secondary auditory cortical area, the response modulation was also bidirectional and showed no clear systematic depressive effect of sleep. When averaged across neurons, sound-evoked activity in these two auditory cortical areas was surprisingly well preserved during sleep. Neural responses to acoustic stimulation were present during both slow-wave and rapid-eye movement sleep, were repeatedly observed over multiple sleep cycles, and demonstrated similar discharge patterns to the responses recorded during wakefulness in the same neuron. Our results suggest that the thalamus is not as effective a gate for the flow of sensory information as previously thought. At the cortical stage, a novel pattern of activation/deactivation appears across neurons. Because the neural signal reaches as far as secondary auditory cortex, this leaves open the possibility of altered sensory processing of auditory information during sleep.",auditory cortex; lateral belt; sleep; primate; sensory; hearing; VISUAL-CORTEX; GENICULATE NEURONS; AROUSAL THRESHOLD; THALAMIC NEURONS; UNIT-ACTIVITY; WAKE CYCLE; ATTENTION; MACAQUE; MECHANISMS; WAKEFULNESS

What is the Bereitschaftspotential? Clin Neurophysiol 2006; 117:2341-56) were studied in patients with Machado-Joseph disease (MID) to elucidate the pathophysiology of voluntary movement. Methods: We studied nine genetically proven MJD patients and eight age-matched healthy subjects. Multi-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings were obtained during self-paced fast extensions of the wrist. EEG epochs were time-locked to electromyography (EMG) onset or offset of the voluntary EMG burst and averaged. Results: In the MJD patients, the early Bereitschaftspotential (early BP, -1500 to -500 ms) was not affected but the late BP was reduced over the central midline area and contralaterally to the movement side. The amplitude of the fpMP, a post-movement MRCP component, was also reduced. In addition, the offset cortical potential in the first 500 ms after EMG offset (Moff + 500) was attenuated bilaterally over a wide cortical area. Conclusions: Findings suggest that cortical activations associated with the initiation and termination of a voluntary movement are impaired in MJD patients. Significance: Abnormalities of pre- and post-movement MRCP components provide researchers with pathophysiological insight into voluntary motor dysfunction in MJD.

To better understand the mechanisms contributing to brain injury and improve outcomes in neonates with HIE, better preclinical animal models that mimic the clinical situation following birth asphyxia in term newborns are needed. In an effort to achieve this goal, we modified our nonhuman primate model of HIE induced by in utero umbilical cord occlusion (UCO) to include postnatal hypoxic episodes, in order to simulate apneic events in human neonates with HIE. We describe a cohort of 4 near-term fetal Macaca nemestrina that underwent 18 min of in utero UCO, followed by cesarean section delivery, resuscitation, and subsequent postnatal mechanical ventilation, with exposure to intermittent daily hypoxia (3 min, 8% O-2 3-8 times daily for 3 days). After delivery, all animals demonstrated severe metabolic acidosis (pH 7 +/- 0.12; mean +/- SD) and low APGAR scores (< 5 at 10 min of age). Three of 4 animals had both electrographic and clinical seizures. Serial blood samples were collected and plasma metabolites were determined by 2-dimensional gas chromatography coupled with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC x GC-TOFMS). The 4 UCO animals and a single nonas-phyxiated animal (delivered by cesarean section but without exposure to UCO or prolonged sedation) underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on day 8 of life. Thalamic injury was present on MRI in 3 UCO animals, but not in the control animal. Following necropsy on day 8, brain histopathology revealed neuronal injury/loss and gliosis in portions of the ventrolateral thalamus in all 4 UCO, with 2 animals also demonstrating putamen/globus pallidus involvement. In addition, all 4 UCO animals demonstrated brain stem gliosis, with neuronal loss present in the midbrain, pons, and lateral medulla in 3 of 4 animals. Transmission electron microscopy imaging of the brain tissues was performed, which demonstrated ultrastructural white matter abnormalities, characterized by perinuclear vacuolation and axonal dilation, in 3 of 4 animals. Immunolabeling of Nogo-A, a negative regulator of neuronal growth, was not increased in the injured brains compared to 2 control animals. Using GC x GC-TOFMS, we identified metabolites previously recognized as potential biomarkers of perinatal asphyxia. The basal ganglia-thala-mus-brain stem injury produced by UCO is consistent with the deep nuclear/brainstem injury pattern seen in human UCO model permits timely detection of biomarkers associated with specific patterns of neonatal brain injury, and it may ultimately be useful for validating therapeutic strategies to treat neonatal HIE.

There are, however, critical, substantive differences in the neuroendocrinology of puberty among species. The onset of puberty in the human is marked by an increase in the amplitude of LH pulses, an indirect indicator of the increase in amplitude of LHRH pulses. The hypothalamic LHRH-pituitary gonadotrophin complex is functional by at least 0.3 gestation in the human foetus; the sex difference in the fetal and neonatal pattern of LH and FSH secretion is an apparent consequence of imprinting of the fetal hypothalamus-pituitary-gonadotropin apparatus by fetal testosterone. Until about 6 months of age in boys and 12-24 months in girls, the testes and ovaries respond to the increased LH in boys and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in girls by secreting testosterone and oestradiol, respectively, reaching levels that are not again achieved before the onset of puberty, Striking features of the ontogeny of the human hypothalamic pulse generator are: (1) its development and function in the foetus; (2) the continued function of the hypothalamic LHRH pulse generator-pituitary gonadotrophingonadal axis in infancy; (3) the gradual damping of hypo-thalamic LHRH oscillator activity during late infancy; (4) its quiescence during childhood - the so-called juvenile pause; (5) during late childhood the gradual disinhibition and reactivation of the LHRH pulse generator, mainly at night; (6) the increasing amplitude of the LHRH pulses, which are reflected in the progressively increased and changing pattern of circulating LH pulses, with the approach of and during puberty. The intrinsic central nervous system (CNS) mechanisms responsible for the inhibition of the LHRH pulse generator during childhood (the juvenile phase) involve the major role of an inhibitory neuronal system -the CNS inhibitory neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and GABAergic neurons, as revealed by studies in the rhesus monkey by Terasawa and her associates. With the onset of puberty, the disinhibition and reactivation of the LHRH pulse generator is associated with a fall in GABAergic neurotransmission and a concomitant increase in the input of excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters (including glutamate) and possibly astroglial-derived growth factors. Despite remarkable progress over the past three decades, large gaps remain in our understanding of the neurobiological, genetic and environmental mechanisms involved in the control of the onset of puberty. The role of leptin in the control of the onset of puberty is reviewed. Severe leptin deficiency is associated with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism; it appears that a critical level of leptin and a leptin signal is required to achieve puberty. The weight of evidence supports the hypothesis that leptin acts as one of several permissive factors and not a trigger in the onset of human puberty. The application of these advances provides a framework for the described classification of sexual precocity and delayed puberty. Copyright (C) 2002 S. Karger AG.

The first aim of this work was to compare two alpha(7) nAChRs PET radioligands, [F-18]ASEM (3-(1,4-diazabicyclo[3.2.2]nonan-4-yl)-6-([F-18]fluorodibenzo[b,d]thiophene 5,5-dioxide) and [F-18]DBT-10 (7-(1,4-diazabicyclo[3.2.2]nonan-4-yl)-2-([F-18]fluorodibenzo[b,d]thiophene 5,5-dioxide), in nonhuman primates. The second aim was to assess further the quantification and test-retest variability of [F-18]ASEM in humans. PET scans with high specific activity [F-18]ASEM or [F-18]DBT-10 were acquired in three rhesus monkeys (one male, two female), and the kinetic properties of these radiotracers were compared. Additional [F-18]ASEM PET scans with blocking doses of nicotine, varenicline, and cold ASEM were acquired separately in two animals. Next, six human subjects (five male, one female) were imaged with [F-18]ASEM PET for 180 min, and arterial sampling was used to measure the parent input function. Different modeling approaches were compared to identify the optimal analysis method and scan duration for quantification of [F-18]ASEM distribution volume (V (T)). In addition, retest scans were acquired in four subjects (three male, one female), and the test-retest variability of V (T) was assessed. In the rhesus monkey brain [F-18]ASEM and [F-18]DBT-10 exhibited highly similar kinetic profiles. Dose-dependent blockade of [F-18]ASEM binding was observed, while administration of either nicotine or varenicline did not change [F-18]ASEM V (T). [F-18]ASEM was selected for further validation because it has been used in humans. Accurate quantification of [F-18]ASEM V (T) in humans was achieved using multilinear analysis with at least 90 min of data acquisition, resulting in V (T) values ranging from 19.6 +/- 2.5 mL/cm(3) in cerebellum to 25.9 +/- 2.9 mL/cm(3) in thalamus. Test-retest variability of V (T) was 11.7 +/- 9.8%.

When most humans learn a new motor skill with one hand, this process results in performance improvements in the opposite hand as well [3-6]. Despite the obvious adaptive advantage of such intermanual transfer, there is no direct evidence identifying the neural substrates of this form of skill acquisition [7-9]. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to study brain regions activated during intermanual transfer of a learned sequence of finger movements. First, we found that the supplementary motor area (SMA) has more activity when a skill has transferred well than when it has transferred poorly. Second, we found that fMRI activity in the ventrolateral posterior thalamic nucleus correlated with successful future intermanual transfer, whereas activity in the ventrolateral anterior thalamic nucleus correlated with past intermanual transfer. Third, we found that repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation applied over the SMA blocked intermanual transfer without affecting skill acquisition. These findings provide direct evidence for an SMA-based mechanism that supports intermanual transfer of motor-skill learning.",nan; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; MACAQUE MONKEY; SUPPLEMENTARY; CEREBELLAR; CORTEX; AREAS; ORGANIZATION; PLASTICITY; SEQUENCES; THALAMUS

The pOFC also sends a uniquely one-way excitatory pathway to the amygdalar inhibitory intercalated masses (IM), which inhibit the medial part of the central amygdalar nucleus (CeM). Inhibition of IM has the opposite effect, allowing amygdalar activation of autonomic structures and emotional arousal. Using multiple labeling approaches to identify pathways and their postsynaptic sites in the amygdala in rhesus monkeys, we found that the anterior cingulate cortex innervated mostly the basolateral and CeM amygdalar nuclei, poised to activate CeM for autonomic arousal. By contrast, a pathway from pOFC to IM exceeded all other pathways to the amygdala by density and size and proportion of large and efficient terminals. Moreover, whereas pOFC terminals in IM innervated each of the three distinct classes of inhibitory neurons, most targeted neurons expressing dopamine-and cAMP-regulated phosphoprotein (DARPP-32+), known to be modulated by dopamine. The predominant pOFC innervation of DARPP-32+ neurons suggests activation of IM and inhibition of CeM, resulting in modulated autonomic function. By contrast, inhibition of DARPP-32 neurons in IM by high dopamine levels disinhibits CeM and triggers autonomic arousal. The findings provide a mechanism to help explain how a strong pOFC pathway, which is poised to moderate activity of CeM, through IM, can be undermined by the high level of dopamine during stress, resulting in collapse of potent inhibitory mechanisms in the amygdala and heightened autonomic drive, as seen in chronic anxiety disorders.",calbindin; DARPP-32; emotions; intercalated masses; macaque brain; nitric oxide synthase; THALAMIC RETICULAR NUCLEUS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; BASOLATERAL AMYGDALA; CONDITIONED FEAR; RHESUS-MONKEY; HIPPOCAMPAL SYNAPSES; IMMUNOREACTIVE CELLS; TEMPORAL PATHWAYS; COGNITIVE CONTROL; PRIMATE AMYGDALA

Since it is not often feasible to monitor vigilance with EEG during fMRI scans, it would be of great value to have methods for estimating vigilance levels from fMRI data alone. A recent study, conducted in macaque monkeys, proposed a template-based approach for fMRI-based estimation of vigilance fluctuations. Here, we use simultaneously acquired EEG/fMRI data to investigate whether the same template-based approach can be employed to estimate vigilance fluctuations of awake humans across different resting-state conditions. We first demonstrate that the spatial pattern of correlations between EEG-defined vigilance and fMRI in our data is consistent with the previous literature. Notably, however, we observed a significant difference between the eyes-closed (EC) and eyes-open (EO) conditions, finding stronger negative correlations with vigilance in regions forming the default mode network and higher positive correlations in thalamus and insula in the EC condition when compared to the EO condition. Taking these correlation maps as templates for vigilance estimation, we found that the template-based approach produced fMRI-based vigilance estimates that were significantly correlated with EEG-based vigilance measures, indicating its generalizability from macaques to humans. We also demonstrate that the performance of this method was related to the overall amount of variability in a subject's vigilance state, and that the template-based approach outperformed the use of the global signal as a vigilance estimator. In addition, we show that the template-based approach can be used to estimate the variability across scans in the amplitude of the vigilance fluctuations. We discuss the benefits and tradeoffs of using the template-based approach in future fMRI studies.",Resting state fMRI; Simultaneous EEG-fMRI; Vigilance; Global signal; Eyes-open; Eyes-closed; Caffeine; INTRINSIC CONNECTIVITY NETWORKS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; ALPHA OSCILLATIONS; SIMULTANEOUS EEG; GLOBAL SIGNAL; SLEEP; WAKEFULNESS; CAFFEINE; BRAIN; ALERTNESS

Indeed, in vitro, the molecule displays high selectivity at mGlu(2) receptors. However, PET experiments performed in rats, macaques and humans, have suggested that [C-11]-JNJ-42491293 could interact with an unidentified, non-mGlu(2) receptor binding site. The brain distribution of [C-11]-JNJ-42491293 has not been determined in the brain of the common marmoset, a small non-human primate increasingly used in neuroscience research. Here, we investigated the distribution of [C-11]-JNJ-42491293 in the marmoset brain. Three marmosets underwent brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and 90-min dynamic PET scans with [C-11]-JNJ-42491293 in combination with vehicle or the mGlu(2) PAM AZD8529 (0.1, 1 and 10 mg/kg). In the scans in which [C-11]-JNJ-42491293 was co-administered with vehicle, the brain areas with the highest standardised uptake values (SUVs) were the midbrain, cerebellum and thalamus, while the lowest SUVs were found in the pons. The addition of AZD8529 (0.1, 1 and 10 mg/kg) to [C-11]-JNJ-42491293 did not modify the SUVs obtained with [C-11]-JNJ-42491293 alone, and ex vivo blocking autoradiography with PAM AZD8529 (10, 100, 300 mu M) on marmoset brain sections showed increased signals in the blocking conditions compared to vehicle, suggesting that no competition occurred between the 2 ligands. The results we obtained here do not suggest that [C-11]-JNJ-42491293 interacts selectively, or even at all, with mGlu(2) receptors in the marmoset, in agreement with findings previously reported in macaque and human.",[C-11]-JNJ-42491293; mGlu(2) receptor; Positive allosteric modulator; Marmoset; PET; AZD8529; POSITIVE ALLOSTERIC MODULATOR; GLUTAMATE-RECEPTOR 2; DISCOVERY; AGONIST; TRACER; MGLUR2

Here, we used high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure responses in the human LGN and SC during sustained spatial attention. Subjects covertly and continuously tracked one of two segments that rotated through the visual field, composed of either moving dots or transient colored shapes. Activity in both nuclei was generally enhanced by attention, independent of the stimulus type, with the voxels responding more sensitively to stimulus contrast ( those dominated by magnocellular input) exhibiting greater attentional enhancement. The LGN contained clusters of voxels exhibiting attentional enhancement or weak suppression, whereas the SC exhibited predominantly attentional enhancement, which was significantly stronger than in the LGN. The spatial distribution of the attentional effects was unrelated to the retinotopic organization in either structure. The results demonstrate that each of the major subcortical visual pathways participates in attentional selection, and their differential magnitudes of modulation suggest distinct roles.",attention; spatial attention; sustained attention; lateral geniculate nucleus; superior colliculus; thalamus; SACCADIC EYE-MOVEMENTS; FUNCTIONAL-ANATOMY; RETINOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; VISUAL-ATTENTION; RHESUS-MONKEY; BRAIN; MACAQUE; MOTION; CONTRAST; NEURONS

We used retrograde transneuronal transport of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) to label second-order neurons that send information to the FEF of cebus monkeys. The saccade region of the FEF was identified physiologically using intracortical stimulation and then injected with a strain of HSV-1 known to be transported transneuronally in the retrograde direction. Retrograde transport of virus labeled neurons was observed in all the thalamic sites known to innervate the FEF. In addition, we found neurons labeled by transneuronal transport in three subcortical sites: the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra, the optic and intermediate gray layers of the superior colliculus, and a posterior portion of the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum. Each of these sites has been shown in prior studies to project to thalamic regions that innervate the FEF. Moreover, the neurons labeled through transneuronal transport were located in a subregion of each subcortical site that is known to be involved in oculomotor control.

Published studies of whole-brain voxel-based morphometry (VBM) published between January 1, 2006 and March 1, 2018 comparing SCI patients with controls were collected by searching PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE databases. Voxel-wise meta-analyses of GMV and WMV differences between SCI patients and controls were performed separately using seed-based d mapping. Twelve studies with 12 GMV data sets and 9 WMV data sets yielded a total of 466 individuals (190 SCI patients and 276 controls) who were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with controls, SCI patients showed GMV atrophy in sensorimotor system regions including the bilateral sensorimotor cortex (S1 and M1), the supplementary motor area (SMA), paracentral gyrus, thalamus, and basal ganglia, as well as WMV loss in the corticospinal tract.GMV aberrancies were also demonstrated in brain regions responsible for cognition and emotion, such as the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the left insula. Additionally, GMV in both the bilateral S1 and the left SMA was positively correlated with the time span after the injury. In conclusion, anatomical atrophy in cortical-thalamic-spinal pathways suggested that SCIs may result in degenerative changes of the sensorimotor system. Further, OFC and insula GMV abnormalities may explain symptoms such as neuropathic pain and potential cognitive-emotional impairments in chronic SCI patients.

IT(C) contains dorsal (ITCd) and ventral (ITCv) areas. The subcortical connections of these subdivisions of IT cortex were determined in the present study from the results of cortical injections of wheat-germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase, [H-3]-amino acids and fast blue. IT(C) and IT(R) receive afferents from the locus coeruleus, dorsal raphe, nucleus annularis, central superior nucleus, pontine reticular formation, lateral hypothalamus, paracentral nucleus, and central medial nucleus; send efferents to the superior colliculus, reticular nucleus, and striatum; and have both afferent and efferent connections with the pretectum, pulvinar, claustrum, amygdala, and basal nucleus of Meynert. IT(C) and IT(R) have different patterns of connections with a number of subcortical structures, including the pulvinar and amygdala. Injections in IT(C) strongly label multiple nuclei of the inferior pulvinar and the medial division of the lateral pulvinar (PL(M)), and moderately label the medial pulvinar (PM), whereas injections in IT(R) strongly label PM and moderately label PL(M). Injections in IT(C) label sparse projections to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala, in contrast to injections in IT(R) that label strong projections to the lateral and basal nuclei of the amygdala. Injections in ''IT(I)'' produce a pattern of subcortical label that has some features of that observed from injections in IT(C) and that observed from injections in IT(R). Although most of the connections of ITCd and ITCv appear similar, only injections involving ITCd label the middle nucleus of the inferior pulvinar (Pl(M)). Comparison of the subcortical connections of subdivisions of IT cortex in squirrel monkeys and what is presently known of the subcortical connections of subdivisions of IT cortex in macaque monkeys supports the previous suggestion that IT(C) of squirrel monkeys may be comparable to area TEO of macaques, IT(I) may be comparable to posterior area TE, and IT(R) May be comparable to anterior area TE (Weller & Steele, 1992).",TE; PULVINAR; AMYGDALA; STRIATUM; PRIMATE; THALAMIC INTRALAMINAR NUCLEI; VISUAL CORTICAL AREAS; RETROGRADE AXONAL-TRANSPORT; CONTAINING CELL BODIES; FRONTAL EYE FIELD; RHESUS-MONKEY; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; MACAQUE MONKEY; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; STRIATE CORTEX

Dextromethorphan (DM) is a widely used antitussive reported to exert anti-inflammatory effect in vivo. In this study, we examined the long-term effect of MDMA on the primate serotonergic system and the protective property of DM against MDMA-induced serotonergic abnormality using single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Nine monkeys (Macaca cyclopis) were divided into three groups, namely control, MDMA and co-treatment (MDMA/DM). [I-123]-ADAM was used as the radioligand for serotonin transporters (SERT) in SPECT scans. SERT levels of the brain were evaluated and presented as the uptake ratios (URs) of [I-123]-ADAM in several regions of interest of the brain including midbrain, thalamus and striatum. We found that the URs of [I-123]-ADAM were significantly lower in the brains of MDMA than control group, indicating lower brain SERT levels in the MDMA-treated monkeys. This MDMA-induced decrease in brain SERT levels could persist for over four years. However, the loss of brain SERT levels was not observed in co-treatment group. These results suggest that DM may exert a protective effect against MDMA-induced serotonergic toxicity in the brains of the non-human primate.","nan; MONOAMINE OXIDASE-B; INDUCED CELL-DEATH; ECSTASY USERS; MICROGLIAL ACTIVATION; INDUCED NEUROTOXICITY; NEURONAL CULTURES; FOCAL ISCHEMIA; RAT-BRAIN; IN-VIVO; 3,4-METHYLENEDIOXYMETHAMPHETAMINE"

Quantitative electron microscopy was carried out on the posteromedial barrel subfield of mouse somatosensory cortex from postnatal day 4 (P4) when thalamocortical innervation of the barrels is becoming established, through to sexual maturity (>P32), and in adulthood. Both asymmetrical (putatively excitatory) and symmetrical (putatively inhibitory) synapses were present in all layers from P4. The symmetrical synapses were immunoreactive for BABA at all ages, There was a progressive increase in both asymmetrical and symmetrical synapses up to P32, density in all layers increasing 16-fold, with the production of asymmetrical synapses leading and greatly outstripping that of symmetrical. From P32 to P120, the oldest age studied, synaptic numbers declined by 18% to 13 times the P4 level, but this affected predominantly layers II/III, IV and V, and mainly involved asymmetrical synapses. The relative percentage of asymmetrical to symmetrical synapses from P4 to P8 was 57%/43% but at P32 it was 89.5%/10.5% and in adulthood 85.4%/14.6%. These data indicate that inhibitory synaptogenesis in the rodent cortex begins earlier than previously thought, a basis for inhibition being present from the earliest period. Pruning of all synapses occurs well after thalamocortical innervation is established and inhibitory synapses are less affected by the pruning process.",nan; SOMATIC SENSORY CORTEX; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; POSTNATAL-DEVELOPMENT; BARREL CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; CELL-DEATH; GLUTAMATE-DECARBOXYLASE; QUANTITATIVE ASPECTS; NEOCORTICAL NEURONS

One way to achieve this objective is the utilization of high-resolution MRI to guide the subsequent dissections.

BOLD fMRI responses to hypercapnic (5% CO2) challenge, 10 Hz flicker visual, and vibrotactile somatosensory-motor stimulations were investigated in baboons anesthetized sequentially with isoflurane and ketamine. Hypercapnia evoked robust BOLD increases. Paralysis was determined to be necessary to achieve reproducible functional activations within and between subjects under our experimental conditions. With optimized anesthetic doses (0.8-1.0% isoflurane or 6-8 mg/kg/h ketamine) and adequate paralysis (vecuronium, 0.2 mg/kg), robust activations were detected in the visual (V), primary (S1) and secondary (S2) somatosensory, primary motor (M cortices), supplementary motor area (SMA), lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and thalamus (Th). Data were tabulated for 11 trials under isoflurane and 10 trials under ketamine on 5 baboons. S1, S2, M, and V activations were detected in essentially all trials (90-100% of the time, except 82% for S2 under isoflurane and 70% for M under ketamine). LGN activations were detected 64-70% of the time under both anesthetics. SMA and Th activations were detected 36-45% of the time under isoflurane and 60% of the time under ketamine. BOLD percent changes among different structures were slightly higher under ketamine than isoflurane (0.75% versus 0.58% averaging all structures), but none was statistically different (P>0.05).

Most of it derives from brain activation studies with PET and fMRI conducted over the last decade. The patterns of activations and deactivations during caloric and galvanic vestibular stimulations in healthy subjects have been compared with those in patients with acute and chronic peripheral and central vestibular disorders. Major findings are the following: (1) In patients with vestibular neuritis the central vestibular system exhibits a spontaneous visual-vestibular activation-deactivation pattern similar to that described in healthy volunteers during unilateral vestibular stimulation. In the acute stage of the disease regional cerebral glucose metabolism (rCGM) increases in the multisensory vestibular cortical and subcortical areas, but simultaneously it significantly decreases in the visual and somatosensory cortex areas. (2) In patients with bilateral vestibular failure the activation-deactivation pattern during vestibular caloric stimulation shows a decrease of activations and deactivations. (3) Patients with lesions of the vestibular nuclei due to Wallenbergs syndrome show no activation or significantly reduced activation in the contralateral hemisphere during caloric irrigation of the ear ipsilateral to the lesioned side, but the activation pattern in the ipsilateral hemisphere appears normal. These findings indicate that there are bilateral ascending vestibular pathways from the vestibular nuclei to the vestibular cortex areas, and the contralateral tract crossing them is predominantly affected. (4) Patients with posterolateral thalamic infarctions exhibit significantly reduced activation of the multisensory vestibular cortex in the ipsilateral hemisphere, if the ear ipsilateral to the thalamic lesion is stimulated. Activation of similar areas in the contralateral hemisphere is also diminished but to a lesser extent. These data demonstrate the functional importance of the posterolateral thalamus as a vestibular gatekeeper. (5) In patients with vestibulocerebellar lesions due to a bilateral floccular deficiency, which causes downbeat nystagmus (DBN), PET scans reveal that rCGM is reduced in the region of the cerebellar tonsil and flocculus/paraflocculus bilaterally. Treatment with 4-aminopyridine lessens this hypometabolism and significantly improves DBN. These findings support the hypothesis that the (para-) flocculus and tonsil play a crucial role in DBN. Although we can now for the first time attribute particular activations and deactivations to functional deficits in distinct vestibular disorders, the complex puzzle of the various multisensory and sensorimotor functions of the phylogenetically ancient vestibular system is only slowly being unraveled.",vestibular system; vestibular disorder; functional imaging; fMRI; PET; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; MONKEYS MACACA-FASCICULARIS; VENTRAL INTRAPARIETAL AREA; VISUAL-MOTION STIMULATION; PARIETAL CORTEX NEURONS; DOWNBEAT NYSTAGMUS; CALORIC STIMULATION; ALERT MONKEY; BILATERAL VESTIBULOPATHY; OPTOKINETIC STIMULATION

Unfortunately, a complete within-subject mapping of commissural projections in humans has been limited due to the inability of typical imaging methods to detect lateral projections in posterior cortical regions. Here, we set out to map callosal projection connectivity, at the single subject level (N=6), by combining high angular resolution diffusion weighted imaging and a novel multi-stage, region-of-interest (ROI) based fiber tracking approach. With these methods we were able to obtain a consistent increase in coverage of lateral projections to posterior cortical regions. Using 70 automatically segmented ROIs in each hemisphere and permutation statistics, we characterized significant interhemispheric connectivity patterns within each subject and observed: (1) consistent projections to frontal, parietal and occipital, but not temporal, areas, (2) a greater relative proportion of homotopic than heterotopic connections, and (3) commissural projections to the basal ganglia and thalamus that are consistent with human and nonhuman primate neuroanatomical literature. These results illustrate the first full connectivity analysis of the human corpus callosum, revealing several patterns consistent with histological findings in the nonhuman primate.

Of the commonly identified central structures, only the anterior cingulate cortex shows a consistent response during the experience of pain. The insula and thalamus demonstrate reasonable consistency while all other regions, including the lentiform nucleus, somatosensory cortex and prefrontal cortex, are active in no more than half the current studies. The reason for such discrepancy is likely to be due in part to methodological variability and in part to individual variability. One aspect of the methodology which is likely to contribute is the stimulus intensity. Studies vary considerably regarding the intensity of the noxious and non-noxious stimuli delivered. This is likely to produce varying activation of central structures coding for the intensity, affective and cognitive components of pain. Using twelve healthy volunteers and positron emission tomography (PET), the regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) responses to four intensities of stimulation were recorded. The stimulation was delivered by a CO2 laser and was described subjectively as either warm (not painful), pain threshold (just painful), mildly painful or moderately painful. The following group subtractions were made to examine the changing cerebral responses as the stimulus intensity increased: (1) just painful - warm; (2) mild pain - warm; and (3) moderate pain - warm. In addition, rCBF changes were correlated with the subjective stimulus ratings. The results for comparison '1' indicated activity in the contralateral prefrontal (area 10/46/44), bilateral inferior parietal (area 40) and ipsilateral premotor cortices (area 6), possibly reflecting initial orientation and plans for movement. The latter comparisons and correlation analysis indicated a wide range of active regions including bilateral prefrontal, inferior parietal and premotor cortices and thalamic responses, contralateral hippocampus, insula and primary somatosensory cortex and ipsilateral perigenual cingulate cortex (area 24) and medial frontal cortex (area 32). Decreased rCBF was observed in the amygdala region. These responses were interpreted with respect to their contribution to the multidimensional aspects of pain including fear avoidance, affect, sensation and motivation or motor initiation. It is suggested that future studies examine the precise roles of each particular region during the central processing of pain. (C) 1997 International Association for the Study of Pain.

VGLUT2 is localized in the cortical terminals of neuronal somas located in the main sensory nuclei of the thalamus. Thus, immunolabeling of cortex with antibodies to VGLUT2 can reveal geniculostriate terminal distributions in species in which connectivity cannot be studied with tract-tracing techniques, permitting broader comparative studies of cortical specializations. Here, we used VGLUT2 immunohistochemistry to compare the organization of geniculostriate afferents in primary visual cortex in hominid primates (humans, chimpanzees, and an orangutan), Old World monkeys (rhesus macaques and vervets), and New World monkeys (squirrel monkeys). The New and Old World monkeys had a broad, dense band of terminal-like labeling in cortical layer 4C, a narrow band of labeling in layer 4A, and additional labeling in layers 2/3 and 6, consistent with results from conventional tract-tracing studies in these species. By contrast, although the hominid primates had a prominent layer 4C band, labeling of layer 4A was sparse or absent. Labeling was also present in layers 2/3 and 6, although labeling of layer 6 was weaker in hominids and possibly more individually variable than in Old and New World monkeys. These findings are consistent with previous observations from cytochrome oxidase histochemistry and a very small number of connectivity studies, suggesting that the projections from the parvocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus to layer 4A were strongly reduced or eliminated in humans and apes following their evolutionary divergence from the other anthropoid primates.

Our intracellular studies of surround suppression in cat primary visual cortex (V1) provide strong evidence on this question. Although suppression has been thought to arise from an increase in lateral inhibition, we find that the inhibition that cells receive is reduced, not increased, by a surround stimulus. Instead, suppression is mediated by a withdrawal of excitation. Thalamic recordings and previous work show that these effects cannot be explained by a withdrawal of thalamic input. We find in theoretical work that this behavior can only arise if V1 operates as an inhibition-stabilized network (ISN), in which excitatory recurrence alone is strong enough to destabilize visual responses but feedback inhibition maintains stability. We confirm two strong tests of this scenario experimentally and show through simulation that observed cell-to-cell variability in surround effects, from facilitation to suppression, can arise naturally from variability in the ISN.",nan; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; EXTRACLASSICAL RECEPTIVE-FIELD; CROSS-ORIENTATION SUPPRESSION; MACAQUE V1 NEURONS; SIMPLE CELLS; THALAMOCORTICAL SYNAPSES; STIMULUS SELECTIVITY; RESPONSE MODULATION; SPATIAL SUMMATION; STRIATE CORTEX

Here functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) shows that the human auditory cortex displays a similar hierarchical organization: pure tones (PTs) activate primarily the core, whereas belt areas prefer complex sounds, such as narrow-band noise bursts.",nan; HUMAN BRAIN; RHESUS-MONKEY; TONOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; CORTICAL CONNECTIONS; MACAQUE MONKEYS; COMPLEX SOUNDS; ANATOMY; AREAS; SUBDIVISIONS; FMRI

Our immediate aim was to explore the inhibitory mechanisms that contribute to orientation selectivity, perhaps the most dramatic response property to emerge across the thalamocortical synapse. The broader goal was to understand how inhibitory circuits operate. Using whole-cell recording in cats in vivo, we found that layer 4 contains two populations of inhibitory cells defined by receptive field class-simple and complex. The simple cells were selective for stimulus orientation, whereas the complex cells were not. Our observations help to explain how neurons become sensitive to stimulus orientation and maintain that selectivity as stimulus contrast changes. Overall, the work suggests that different sources of inhibition, either selective for specific features or broadly tuned, interact to provide appropriate representations of elements within the environment.",nan; CAT STRIATE CORTEX; RAT SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; ORIENTATION SELECTIVITY; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; SIMPLE CELLS; IN-VIVO; SYNAPTIC INTEGRATION; MACAQUE MONKEY; BASKET CELLS; CONTRAST

The [F-18]fluoroethylated analogs of SA4503 and SA5845 ([F-18]FE-SA4503 and [F-18]FE-SA5845) were evaluated in conscious monkeys to estimate its suitability for human application for PET. Conscious monkeys (Macaca Mulatta) were either scanned with [F-18]FE-SA4503 or [F-18]FE-SA5845 (n = 3 for both groups, 220 - 802 MBq). After a dynamic study of 120 min, radioactivity was displaced by intravenous (i.v.) injection of haloperidol (1 mg/kg). One month later the same set of three monkeys were scanned with [F-18]FE-SA4503 for 120 min and cold SA4503 (1 mg/kg) was infused to displace the radioactivity, and the other three monkeys were pretreated with haloperidol (1 mg/kg) before the 120-min PET-scan with [F-18]FE-SA5845. Cortical areas (cingulate, frontal, occipital, parietal, temporal), striatum, and thalamus showed high radioactivity uptake. Infusion of haloperidol displaced the radioactivity levels of the two radioligands. The same effect was found for [18F]FE-SA4503 after SA4503 displacement. Pretreatment with haloperidol blocked the [F-18]FE-SA5845 binding to give PET-images with low and uniform uptake in the brain. The findings demonstrated the reversible binding of the two radioligands. Metabolite analysis showed that 14% and 23% parent compound of [F-18]FE-SA5845 and [F-18]FE-SA4503, respectively, at 120 min postinjection was present in plasma. Kinetic analysis showed that the binding potential of [F-18]FE-SA5845 was higher in all brain regions than that of [F-18]FE-SA4503 (4.75-8.79 vs. 1.65-4.04). The highest binding potential was found in the hippocampus, followed by the cortical regions, thalamus, cerebellar hemisphere, striatum and vermis. Both [F-18]FE-SA compounds bound specifically to cerebral sigma receptors of the monkey and have potential for mapping sigma receptors in the human brain.

As brain atlases are essential tools for brain investigation, the objective of the current work was to create the first 3D digital atlas of the mouse lemur brain. For this, a template image was constructed from in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of 34 animals. This template was then manually segmented into 40 cortical, 74 subcortical and 6 cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) regions. Additionally, we generated probability maps of gray matter, white matter and CSF. The template, manual segmentation and probability maps, as well as imaging tools used to create and manipulate the template, can all be freely downloaded. The atlas was first used to automatically assess regional age-associated cerebral atrophy in a cohort of mouse lemurs previously studied by voxel based morphometry (VBM). Results based on the atlas were in good agreement with the VBM ones, showing age-associated atrophy in the same brain regions such as the insular, parietal or occipital cortices as well as the thalamus or hypothalamus. The atlas was also used as a tool for comparative neuroanatomy. To begin with, we compared measurements of brain regions in our MRI data with histology-based measures from a reference article largely used in previous comparative neuroanatomy studies. We found large discrepancies between our MRI-based data and those of the reference histology-based article. Next, regional brain volumes were compared amongst the mouse lemur and several other mammalian species where high quality volumetric MRI brain atlases were available, including rodents (mouse, rat) and primates (marmoset, macaque, and human). Unlike those based on histological atlases, measures from MRI atlases indicated similar cortical to cerebral volume indices in all primates, including in mouse lemurs, and lower values in mice. On the other hand, white matter to cerebral volume index increased from rodents to small primates (mouse lemurs and marmosets) to macaque, reaching their highest values in humans.",Atlas; Cerebral atrophy; Comparative anatomy; MRI; Mouse lemur; Template; TEMPLATE IMAGES; SEGMENTATION; MODEL; EVOLUTION; ATROPHY

Whether the claustrum has closer affinities with the cortex or the striatum has been debated for many decades. Our observation of histological sections from primate brains and genomic data in the mouse suggest former. Given this, the present study compares the connections of the two structures in Micro-cebus using high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI, with 72 directions), with a very small voxel size (90 micra), and probabilistic fiber tractography. High angular and spatial resolution diffusion imaging is non-destructive, requires no surgical interventions, and the connection of each and every voxel can be mapped, whereas in conventional tract tracer studies only a few specific injection sites can be assayed. Our data indicate that despite the high genetic and spatial affinities between the two structures, their connectivity patterns are very different. The claustrum connects with many cortical areas and the olfactory bulb; its strongest probabilistic connections are with the entorhinal cortex, suggesting that the claustrum may have a role in spatial memory and navigation. By contrast, the insula connects with many subcortical areas, including the brainstem and thalamic structures involved in taste and visceral feelings. Overall, the connections of the Microcebus claustrum and insula are similar to those of the rodents, cat, macaque, and human, validating our results. The insula in the Microcebus connects with the dorsolateral frontal cortex in contrast to the mouse insula, which has stronger connections with the ventromedial frontal lobe, yet this is consistent with the dorsolateral expansion of the frontal cortex in primates. In addition to revealing the connectivity patterns of the Microcebus brain, our study demonstrates that HARDI, at high resolutions, can be a valuable tool for mapping fiber pathways for multiple sites in fixed brains in rare and difficult-to-obtain species.",Microcebus murinus; gray mouse lemur; claustrum; insula; HARDI; probabilistic fiber tractography; OLD-WORLD MONKEY; PREFRONTAL CORTICAL PROJECTIONS; DEVELOPING MOUSE-BRAIN; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; PRIMATE BRAIN; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; EFFERENT CONNECTIONS; ENDOPIRIFORM NUCLEUS; RETROGRADE TRANSPORT; MACAQUE MONKEYS

Recent studies have suggested that parkinsonism is closely associated with increased amplitude and duration of beta burst activity in the subthalamic nucleus (STN). How beta burst dynamics are altered from the normal to parkinsonian state across the basal ganglia-thalamocortical (BGTC) motor network, however, remains unclear. In this study, we simultaneously recorded local field potential activity from the STN, internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi), and primary motor cortex (M1) in three female rhesus macaques, and characterized how beta burst activity changed as the animals transitioned from normal to progressively more severe parkinsonian states. Parkinsonism was associated with an increased incidence of beta bursts with longer duration and higher amplitude in the low beta band (8-20 Hz) in both the STN and GPi, but not in M1. We observed greater concurrence of beta burst activity, however, across all recording sites (M1, STN, and GPi) in PD. The simultaneous presence of low beta burst activity across multiple nodes of the BGTC network that increased with severity of PD motor signs provides compelling evidence in support of the hypothesis that low beta synchronized oscillations play a significant role in the underlying pathophysiology of PD. Given its immersion throughout the motor circuit, we hypothesize that this elevated beta-band activity interferes with spatial-temporal processing of information flow in the BGTC network that contributes to the impairment of motor function in PD.",burst coupling; low beta burst; MPTP; nonhuman primate; Parkinson's disease; temporal dynamics; nan

There are essentially two views of how selectivity arises. Feed-forward models rely entirely on the organization of thalamocortical inputs. Feedback models rely on lateral inhibition to refine selectivity relative to a weak bias provided by thalamocortical inputs. The debate is driven by two divergent lines of evidence. On the one hand, many response properties appear to require lateral inhibition, including precise orientation and direction selectivity and crossorientation suppression. On the other hand, intracellular recordings have failed to find consistent evidence for lateral inhibition. Here we demonstrate a resolution to this paradox. Feed-forward models incorporating the intrinsic nonlinear properties of cortical neurons and feed-forward circuits (i.e., spike threshold, contrast saturation, and spike-rate rectification) can account for properties that have previously appeared to require lateral inhibition.",nan; CROSS-ORIENTATION SUPPRESSION; CATS STRIATE CORTEX; RECEPTIVE-FIELD STRUCTURE; SIMPLE CELLS; MACAQUE V1; DIRECTION SELECTIVITY; SPATIAL-FREQUENCY; CORTICAL-NEURONS; AREA 17; CONTRAST INVARIANCE

Extracellular cell activity during saccades, saccade-like image shifts, and various stationary visual stimuli was recorded together with the animals' eye positions. All neurons analyzed had receptive fields that covered most of the central 80x80 degrees of the animals' visual field and did only respond to large (>20 degrees) visual stimuli. According to their response properties, recorded neurons were divided into three populations. The first group, termed S neurons (16%), responded when the animals performed saccades but were unresponsive to any of the visual stimuli tested. These neurons do not seem to receive a visual input that is strong enough to drive them. The second group, termed V neurons (51%), responded to various visual stimuli including saccade-like image motion when the eyes were stationary, but not when the animals executed saccades. V neurons therefore distinguish retinal image movements that are generated externally from internally generated image motion. Finally, SV neurons (31%) responded when the animals made saccades as well as to saccade-like image motion or to stationary stimuli. Although these neurons do not distinguish self-induced retinal image motion from motion generated by external stimulus movements, they must receive non-retinal motion-related input, because responses elicited by saccades had shorter latencies than responses to saccade-like stimulus movements. Only SV neurons resemble response properties of pretectal neurons that project to the pulvinar and that comprise the major subcortical visual input.

Pioneering studies on perceptual suppression (PS) described specific local neural network responses in primary visual cortex, thalamus and lateral prefrontal cortex of the macaque brain. Yet the neural effects of PS have rarely been studied with intracerebral recordings outside these cortices and simultaneously across distant brain areas. Here, we combined (1) a novel experimental paradigm in which we produced a similar perceptual disappearance and also re-appearance by using visual adaptation with transient contrast changes, with (2) electrophysiological observations from human intracranial electrodes sampling wide brain areas. We focused on broadband high-frequency (50-150 Hz, i.e., gamma) and low-frequency (8-24 Hz) neural activity amplitude modulations related to target visibility and invisibility. We report that low-frequency amplitude modulations reflected stimulus visibility in a larger ensemble of recording sites as compared to broadband gamma responses, across distinct brain regions including occipital, temporal and frontal cortices. Moreover, the dynamics of the broadband gamma response distinguished stimulus visibility from stimulus invisibility earlier in anterior insula and inferior frontal gyrus than in temporal regions, suggesting a possible role of fronto-insular cortices in top down processing for conscious perception. Finally, we report that in primary visual cortex only low-frequency amplitude modulations correlated directly with perceptual status. Interestingly, in this sensory area broadband gamma was not modulated during PS but became positively modulated after 300 ms when stimuli were rendered visible again, suggesting that local networks could be ignited by top down influences during conscious perception.",perceptual suppression; broadband gamma; conscious perception; anterior insula; primary visual cortex; visibility; intracranial EEG; contrast adaptation; MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; MACAQUE AREA V4; SINGLE-NEURON; GAMMA-OSCILLATIONS; BOLD SIGNAL; FREQUENCY OSCILLATIONS; CONTRAST ADAPTATION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; FLASH SUPPRESSION; HUMAN BRAIN

While amnestic AD is characterized by disrupted default mode network (DMN) connectivity with corresponding increases in salience network (SN) connectivity, a visuospatial network appears to be disrupted early in PCA. Based on PCA patients' clinical features, we hypothesized that, in addition to early decreased integrity within the visuospatial network, patients with PCA would show increases in SN connectivity despite relative preservation of DMN. As the lateral pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus has direct anatomical connections with striate and extrastriate cortex and DMN, and the medial pulvinar is anatomically interconnected with SN, we further hypothesized that lateral and medial pulvinar nuclei might be implicated in intrinsic connectivity changes in PCA. Methods: 26 patients with PCA and 64 matched controls were recruited through UCSF Memory and Aging Center research programs. Each completed a standardized neuropsychological battery, structural MRI, and task-free fMRI. Seed-based functional correlations were used to probe networks of interest, including those seeded by the medial and lateral pulvinar thalamic nuclei, across the whole brain, and functional data analyses were adjusted for brain atrophy. Results: Patients with PCA showed disproportionate deficits in the visuospatial domain; they also showed preserved social sensitivity and endorsed more depressive symptoms than HCs. PCA patients had significant parietooccipital atrophy accompanied by widespread connectivity decreases within the visuospatial network, enhanced connectivity between some structures in SN, and enhanced connectivity between key nodes of the DMN compared to controls. Increased SN connectivity correlated with a measure of social sensitivity, and increased DMN connectivity correlated with short-term memory performance. Medial pulvinar connectivity increases in PCA were topographically similar to SN (anterior insula) connectivity increases, while lateral pulvinar connectivity increases were similar to DMN (posterior cingulate) connectivity increases. Conclusions: PCA is characterized by preserved to heightened connectivity in the SN and DMN despite decreased visuospatial network connectivity. The spatial similarity of medial and lateral pulvinar connectivity changes to those seen in the SN and DMN suggests a role for the pulvinar in intrinsic connectivity network changes in PCA.",Posterior cortical atrophy; Pulvinar; Alzheimer's disease; Functional connectivity; Default mode network; Salience network; DEFAULT-MODE NETWORK; VARIANT FRONTOTEMPORAL DEMENTIA; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; MEDIAL PULVINAR; RHESUS-MONKEY; ORGANIZATION; CORTEX; DIAGNOSIS; PATHOLOGY

The development of this projection was compared to patterns of migration and settling of [H-3]-thymidine-labeled neurons destined for cortical layer IV, and to geniculocortical synapse formation. DiI-labeled geniculocortical axons were found in the intermediate zone beneath the lateral cerebral mantle at embryonic day (E)17 and in the subplate layer underlying visual cortex by E18. On E19 they appeared to accumulate and grow radially into an expanding subplate layer and into the deep part of developing cortical layer VI. By postnatal day (P)0, Dil or WGA-HRP-labeled geniculocortical axons were found in developing cortical layers VI and V. By P1, they invaded the deep portion of the cell-dense cortical plate, where they were in position to make initial contact with neurons that would later form layer IV. A few axons traversed the cortical plate to reach the marginal zone. Layer IV became an identifiable layer on P2, and a clear projection to layer IV was evident by P3. These results suggest that geniculocortical afferents grow continuously from the intermediate zone, initially into an expanding subplate layer and then sequentially into each of the developing cortical layers without evidence of ''waiting.'' Electron microscopic data suggest that geniculocortical axons begin to form immature synapses with dendrites and neuronal perikarya as they first encounter cortical neurons, first in the subplate layer and then in developing layers VI, V and marginal zone, in addition to the primary target layer IV. The precise targeting and overall temporal and laminar patterns of ingrowth and synaptogenesis suggest that geniculocortical axons are directed to the visual cortex by guidance cues within the internal capsule and subplate. Further, they reach the occipital pole early enough to influence the specification and histogenesis of cortical area 17, perhaps by exerting an influence on the deep-to-superficial ''wave'' of neuronal differentiation in sequentially developing subplate and cortical layers VI, V and IV.

We previously found regional covariance patterns of gray matter with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in healthy humans and rhesus macaques, using multivariate network Scaled Subprofile Model (SSM) analysis and voxel-based morphometry (VBM), supporting aging effects including in prefrontal and temporal cortices. This approach has yet to be applied to neuroimaging in rodent models of aging. We investigated 7.0T MRI gray matter covariance in 10 young and 10 aged adult male Fischer 344 rats to identify, using SSM VBM, the age-related regional network gray matter covariance pattern in the rodent. SSM VBM identified a regional pattern that distinguished young from aged rats, characterized by reductions in prefrontal, temporal association/perirhinal, and cerebellar areas with relative increases in somatosensory, thalamic, midbrain, and hippocampal regions. Greater expression of the age-related MRI gray matter pattern was associated with poorer spatial learning in the age groups combined. Aging in the rat is characterized by a regional network pattern of gray matter reductions corresponding to aging effects previously observed in humans and non-human primates. SSM MRI network analyses can advance translational aging neuroscience research, extending from human to small animal models, with potential for evaluating mechanisms and interventions for cognitive aging.",aging; behavior; prefrontal cortex; perirhinal cortex; structural covariance; scaled subprofile model; COGNITIVE RESERVE; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; BRAIN; PATTERNS; VOLUME; ADULT; MRI; ASSOCIATION; PERFORMANCE; MORPHOMETRY

Neurons containing one or other of these proteins were present in most (but not all) regions of the complex and were differentially distributed: parvalbumin immunoreactive neurons tended to form densely packed clusters in the ventral nucleus and rather loose arrangements in the anterodorsal and posterodorsal nuclei, whereas most calbindin neurons were scattered, with concentrations in the caudal end of the posterodorsal and in the magnocellular nuclei. In fluorescent tracer experiments combined with immunohistochemistry, it was found that parvalbumin and calbindin neurons project to layer IV and to layer I, respectively, of the primary auditory cortex.

However, a systematic neuropathological analysis of the hippocampal formation and the thalamus in these rats is lacking. It is also unclear if reelin, a protein consistently associated with schizophrenia and potentially involved in the mechanism of action of MAM, participates in the neuropathological effects of this compound. Therefore, a thorough assessment including cytoarchitectural and neuromorphometric measurements of eleven brain regions was conducted. Numbers of reelin positive cells and reelin expression and methylation levels were also studied. Principal Findings: Compared to untreated rats, MAM-exposed animals showed a reduction in the volume of entorhinal cortex, hippocampus and mediodorsal thalamus associated with decreased neuronal soma. The entorhinal cortex also showed laminar disorganization and neuronal clusters. Reelin methylation in the hippocampus was decreased whereas reelin positive neurons and reelin expression were unchanged. Conclusions: Our results indicate that E17-MAM exposure reproduces findings from the hippocampal formation and the mediodorsal thalamus of patients with schizophrenia while providing little support for reelin's involvement. Moreover, these results strongly suggest MAM-treated animals have a diminished neuropil, which likely arises from abnormal neurite formation; this supports a recently proposed pathophysiological hypothesis for schizophrenia.",nan; MEDIODORSAL THALAMIC NUCLEUS; PYRAMIDAL CELL DISARRAY; TOTAL NEURON NUMBER; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; METHYLAZOXYMETHANOL-ACETATE; BIPOLAR DISORDER; WORKING-MEMORY; ADULT RATS; SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY

These changes can be attributed to processes that are intrinsic to the cortex, or can be inherited from alterations occurring at stages of sensory processing that are antecedent to the primary sensory cortical areas. In the visual system, focal binocular retinal lesions initially silence an area of cortex that represents the region of retina destroyed, but over a period of months this area recovers visually driven activity. The retinotopic map in the recovered area is altered, shifting its representation to the portion of retina immediately surrounding the lesion. This effectively shrinks the representation of the lesioned area of retina, and expands the representation of the lesion surround. To determine the loci along the visual pathway at which the reorganization takes place, we compared the course of topographic alterations in the primary visual cortex and dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of cats and monkeys, At a time when the cortical reorganization is complete, the silent area of LGN persists, indicating that changes in cortical topography are due to alterations that are intrinsic to the cortex. To explore the participation of thalamocortical afferents in the reorganization, we injected a series of retrogradely transported fluorescent tracers into reorganized and surrounding cortex of each animal. Our results show that the thalamocortical arbors do not extend beyond their normal lateral territory and that this physical dimension is insufficient to account for the reorganization. We suggest that the long-range intrinsic horizontal connections are a likely source of visual input into the reorganized cortical area.",CORTICAL TOPOGRAPHY; ADULT PLASTICITY; VISUAL CORTEX; TOPOGRAPHIC REORGANIZATION; LATERAL GENICULATE NUCLEUS; RETINAL LESIONS; RACCOON SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; LATERAL GENICULATE NEURONS; PARTIAL DIGIT DENERVATION; PERIPHERAL-NERVE INJURY; RAT DORSAL HORN; VISUAL-CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; RAPID REORGANIZATION; THALAMIC PROJECTIONS; SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX

The pulvinar has enlarged substantially during evolution, although little has previously been known about its function. Recent studies suggest that the pulvinar contains neurons that generate signals related to the salience of visual objects. This evidence includes: (1) anatomical and physiological observations of visual function; (2) augmented responses in the pulvinarfor visual stimuli presented in important contexts; (3) suppression of activity for stimuli presented in irrelevant conditions; (4) thalamic modulation producing behavioral changes in cued attention paradigms; and (5) similar changes with visual distracter tasks.",nan; BEHAVING RHESUS-MONKEY; INDUCED STIMULUS MOVEMENT; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; SPATIAL ATTENTION; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; MACACA-MULATTA; CEBUS MONKEY; RESPONSES; PROJECTIONS; NEURONS

Results were compared with expression patterns in adults. In the sensorimotor cortex at E125, overall levels of all subunit transcripts were low. At E137, there was a major lamina-specific increase in all subunit messenger RNAs except gamma(1). For alpha(1), alpha(2), alpha(4), beta(2), beta(3) and gamma(1) subunit transcripts, this increase was highest in areas 3a and 3b, particularly in layers III/IV and VI. Postnatally, there were significant decreases in all transcripts. alpha(1), alpha(5), beta(2) and gamma(2) subunit transcripts, while still at significantly lower levels than at E137, remained expressed at levels higher than other transcripts. Unlike in rodents, there was no obvious switch in the major subunits expressed in fetal and adult cortex, alpha(1), alpha(5), beta(2) and gamma(2) remaining highest throughout. In area 17, the most prominently expressed subunits at earliest ages were alpha(2), alpha(5), beta(1), beta(2), beta(3) and gamma(2), especially in layers II/III and VI. At E150, expression for alpha(2), alpha(3), beta(1) and beta(3) subunit transcripts in these layers decreased, but levels for alpha(1), alpha(4), alpha(5), beta(2), gamma(1) and gamma(2) transcripts increased, particularly within layer IV. The increase at E150 was particularly marked for alpha(5) transcripts, which were expressed at levels more than four times those of other transcripts. alpha(1), beta(2) and gamma(2) remain highest into aduthood. Fetal area 17 displayed lamina-specific patterns of expression not found in adult animals. In particular, alpha(3) messenger RNAs were present in layer IVA and gamma(1) transcripts were present in layer IVC at E150, despite a lack of expression in these layers in the adult. These data demonstrate increased expression of GABA(A) receptors during the period of establishment of thalamocortical and intracortical connections, and a temporal regulation that may be associated with the period of developmental plasticity.

Although each of these areas has a distinct structure and connections, they can be grouped into two networks, defined by cortico-cortical connections that primarily interconnect areas within each network. The networks also have different connections to the striatum, medial thalamus, and other brain regions. The orbital network consists of most of the areas In the orbital cortex. It receives several sensory inputs (olfactory, gustatory, visceral afferent, somatic sensory, and visual) that appear to be related to feeding. It also receives many limbic inputs from the amygdala, entorhinal and perirhinal cortex, and subiculum, including a specific projection from the ventrolateral part of the basal amygdaloid nucleus. The orbital network may therefore serve as a substrate to integrate viscerosensory information with affective signals. The medial network consists of areas on the medial frontal surface together with a few select areas in the orbital cortex. These areas have few direct sensory inputs, and their limbic inputs are somewhat different than those to the orbital network (e.g., from the ventromedial part of the basal amygdaloid nucleus). However, they provide the major output from the OMPFC to the hypothalamus and brain stem (especially the periaqueductal gray). The medial network may therefore serve as visceromotor system to provide frontal cortical influence over autonomic and endocrine function. Connections between the networks presumably allow information now from viscerosensory to visceromotor systems. In addition to a probable role in eating behavior, this system appears to be involved in guiding behavior and regulation of mood. Lesions of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex result in sociopathic behavior and difficulty in making appropriate choices, whereas functional imaging studies indicate that subjects with unipolar and bipolar depression have abnormal activity in medial and orbital prefrontal areas. Many of these areas also show volume changes and decreased glial number and density in mood-disordered subjects.",nan; MIDBRAIN PERIAQUEDUCTAL GRAY; MEDIODORSAL THALAMIC NUCLEUS; MACAQUE MONKEYS; RHESUS-MONKEY; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; TOPOGRAPHIC ORGANIZATION; COLUMNAR ORGANIZATION; EMOTIONAL EXPRESSION; MACACA-FASCICULARIS

Most of these connections are reciprocal and also support amygdaloid modulation of sensory processing. (2) A set of projections extends from the amygdala to the hypothalamus and brain stem, which appears to modulate visceral function in relation to emotional stimuli. (3) A forebrain circuit involves the amygdala with the ventromedial frontal, rostral insular, and rostral temporal cortical areas, the medial thalamus and ventromedial basal ganglia, and seems to be directly involved in emotional behavior and mood. All of these systems are present in all mammals studied; the major differences lie in the greater elaboration of the cerebral cortex in primates.",rat; cat; monkey; visceral function; emotional behavior; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MEDIODORSAL THALAMIC NUCLEUS; CORTICAL AFFERENT CONNECTIONS; MACAQUE MONKEYS; AMYGDALOSTRIATAL PROJECTIONS; LONGITUDINAL COLUMNS; PERIAQUEDUCTAL GRAY; BASAL FOREBRAIN; BRAIN-STEM; RAT

The distribution of neuronal populations containing the calcium-binding proteins calbindin and parvalbumin, which are recognized markers for the GABAergic neurons in cerebral cortex, is compared in five species of toothed whales and in representatives (one species each) of insectivores, bats, rodents, and primates. Computerized image analysis has shown that overall quantitative characteristics of GABAergic cortical neurons in toothed whales are similar to those in other mammalian orders. Thus, GABA-positive neurons represent 26% of the total population of cortical neurons in the visual cortex of whales. Some 97% of GABA-positive cells contain calcium-binding proteins, which is numerically similar to these parameters found in primates and other mammals. On the other hand, the typology and laminar distribution of calcium-binding protein-containing neurons in the primary visual cortex of five whale species (Delphinapterus leucas, Globicephala melaena, Phocoena phocoena, Stenella coeruleoalba, and Tursiops truncatus) differ significantly from those of primates (Macaca mulatta) and rodents (Rattus rattus) and are similar to those found in insectivorous bats (Eptesicus fuscus) and hedgehogs (Erinaceus europaeus). In whales, bats, and hedgehogs a significant concentration of calbindin-positive, vertically oriented bipolar and bitufted neurons was found in layers I, II, and IIIc/V with their axons arranged in a three-dimensional network. In primates and rodents they are distributed evenly across all cortical layers and are predominantly multipolar or bitufted neurons found in all cortical layers with their axons oriented along the vertical axis of the cortical plate. The parvalbumin-positive neurons in all mammalian species, including toothed whales, are represented by variously sized multipolar non-pyramidal cells. As opposed to all other mammalian species, the major concentrations of parvalbumin-positive neurons in whales are found in layers IIIc/V and VI, whereas in other cortical layers there are only scattered parvalbumin-positive neurons. Thus, in layers IIIc/V and VI calbindin- and parvalbumin-positive neuronal populations form overlapping populations. In other mammalian species the parvalbumin-positive neurons are distributed more evenly between different cortical layers. The other prominent difference between mammalian orders was found in the quantitative relationships between calbindin-positive and parvalbumin-positive cortical neurons. Thus, the cortical calbindin-positive neuronal population is significantly (two to four times) higher relative to the parvalbumin-positive population of neurons in whales and evolutionary conservative mammals (bats and hedgehogs), whereas in phylogenetically progressive mammals (primates) and moderately progressive mammals (rodents) calbindin- and parvalbumin-positive populations are approximately equal in their relative concentrations. These data suggest that in cetacean primary visual cortex, as well as in primary cortices of prototypal terrestrial mammals, the calbindin-positive system of neurons is expressed considerably stronger than the parvalbumin system. These findings may relate to the absence or incipience (i.e., relatively poor development) of layer IV and hypertrophy of layers I and II in cetacean and prototypal mammalian sensory neocortices. This, in turn, suggests several important differences between prototypal and evolutionary progressive mammalian orders in the organization of neocortical afferentation. In whales and, to a lesser extent, in archetypal terrestrial mammals calbindin-positive nuclei of the thalamus may send strong calbindin-positive afferents to calbindin-rich superficial cortical layers as well as to limited mid-cortical layers, whereas parvalbumin-positive afferents from the thalamus may be reduced in view of the absence or incipience of layer IV.",nan; GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRIC ACID; MONKEY CEREBRAL-CORTEX; SENSORY-MOTOR CORTEX; HEDGEHOG ERINACEUS-EUROPAEUS; GABA-IMMUNOREACTIVE NEURONS; MACAQUE STRIATE CORTEX; CHANDELIER CELL AXONS; THALAMIC VPM NUCLEUS; NEOCORTICAL LAYER-I; PARVALBUMIN IMMUNOREACTIVITY

The idea that cognition and emotion are separable, antagonistic forces competing for dominance of mind has been hard to displace despite abundant evidence to the contrary. For instance, it is now known that a pathological absence of emotion leads to profound impairment of decision making. Behavioral observations of this kind are corroborated at the mechanistic level: neuroanatomical studies reveal that brain are as typically described as underlying either cognitive or emotional processes are linked in ways that imply complex interactions that do not resemble a simple mutual antagonism. Instead, physiological studies and network simulations suggest that top down signals from prefrontal cortexrealize cognitive control inpart by either suppressing or promoting emotional responses controlled by the a mygdala,in away that facilitates adaptation to changing task demands. Behavioral, anatomical, and physiological data suggest that emotion and cognition are equal partners in enabling a continuumor matrix offl exible behaviors that are sub served by multiple brain regions acting in concert.

We recorded the resting FMRI signal from 16 patients and 22 controls. We used seed-based functional correlation analyses to calculate partial correlations of all voxels in the hippocampus relative to characteristic regional signal changes in the thalamus, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), while controlling for ventricular CSF and white matter signals. Group comparisons were carried out controlling for age, gender, hippocampal volume and brain volume. The strength of functional connectivity in each region also was correlated with neuropsychological measures. We found that the hippocampus can be segmented into three distinct functional subregions (head, body, and tail), according to the relative connectivity with PFC, PCC and thalamus, respectively. The AD group showed stronger hippocampus-PFC and weaker hippocampus-PCC functional connectivity, the magnitudes of which correlated with MMSE in both cases. The results are consistent with an adaptive role of the PFC in the context of progression of dysfunction in PCC during earlier stages of AD. Extension of our approach could integrate regional volume measures for the hippocampus with their functional connectivity patterns in ways that should increase sensitivity for assessment of AD onset and progression.

In both temporal and nasal retinae, amacrine cells, including some displaced amacrine cells, expressed NAAG immunoreactivity. In temporal but not nasal retina, retinal ganglion cells were stained, as were their dendrites in the inner plexiform layer, and their axons in the optic nerve fiber layer. In nasal retina, the ganglion cells had degenerated because they were axotomized by the optic chiasm section. In the target regions of the retinal ganglion cells, the superior colliculus and the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), both neuropil and cell bodies were stained. In LGN, staining was confined to layers 2, 3, and 5, that is, to the layers innervated by the intact ipsilateral pathway. Immunoreactivity was also seen in the cells of layers 2, 3A, 4B, 5, and 6 of area 17 and layers 3 and 5 of area 18. The neuropil was stained in all layers of area 17, but more heavily in layers 1, 2, 4B, the bottom of 4C-beta, 5B, and 6B. Within 4C the staining was patchy; in tangential sections there were alternating bands of light and dark label which matched the ocular dominance bands demonstrated by cytochrome oxidase histochemistry in adjacent sections. This banding pattern is consistent with the presence of NAAG in geniculocortical terminals of the intact ipsilateral pathway and the absence of such terminals for the contralateral pathway, which had undergone transneuronal degeneration due to the optic chiasm sectioning. Overall, our results for monkey are very similar to those in cat and suggest that NAAG or a structurally related molecule may have a prominent role in the communication of visual signals at retinal, thalamic, and cortical levels.",RETINA; VISUAL CORTEX; LATERAL GENICULATE NUCLEUS; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; IMMUNOHISTOCHEMISTRY; PEPTIDE; MONKEY; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; GLUTAMIC-ACID DECARBOXYLASE; TYROSINE-HYDROXYLASE ACTIVITY; SUPERIOR CERVICAL-GANGLION; MEDIATING EXCITATORY INPUT; ACETYL-ASPARTYL-GLUTAMATE; GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRIC ACID; SPINAL SENSORY GANGLIA; MACAQUE STRIATE CORTEX

The present study was aimed to investigate the effects of antimuscarinic agents, oxybutynin and imidafenacin, on temporal changes in cognitive function and central mAChR occupancy in conscious monkeys (Macaca mulatto). Three conscious monkeys underwent positron emission tomography (PET) scans with a mAChR radioligand N-[C-11]methyl-3-piperidyl benzilate ([C-11]( +)3-MPB). The scan sequence was pre, and 1, 4, and 24 h post oral administration of oxybutynin (0.1-1.0 mg/kg) or imidafenacin (0.01-0.1 mg/kg). Maximum cognitive impairment was observed 1 h post-oxybutynin at oral doses of 0.3 and 1.0 mg/kg, in a dose-dependent manner, and oxybutynin produced significant positive correlations between mAChR occupancy and cognitive impairment in the cortices, thalamus, brainstem, and striatum. The most significant correlation was observed in the brainstem, and then cortices. In contrast, imidafenacin did not induce discernible cognitive impairment, despite having obtained some lesser occupancy in cortices and brainstem. We propose that the thresholds of mAChR occupancy to produce cognitive impairment by antimuscarinic agents are ca. 30-40% in cortices and ca. 20-30% in brainstem, and a desirable drug for OAB treatment should not occupy central mAChR above these thresholds.

The development of a pseudotyped lentiviral vector with the property of retrograde infection allows us to introduce foreign genes into neurons that are localized in regions innervating the site of vector injection. Here, we report the efficiency of retrograde gene transfer of a recently developed FuG-E pseudotyped lentiviral vector in the primate brain by comparing its transduction pattern with that of the parental FuG-C pseudotyped vector. After injection of the FuG-E vector encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP) into the striatum of macaque monkeys, many GFP-immunoreactive neurons were found in regions projecting to the striatum, such as the cerebral cortex, thalamus, and substantia nigra. Quantitative analysis revealed that in all regions, the number of neurons retrogradely transduced with the FuG-E vector was larger than in the FuG-C vector injection case. It was also confirmed that the FuG-E vector displayed explicit neuronal specificity to the same extent as the FuG-C vector. This vector might promote approaches to pathway-selective gene manipulation and provide a powerful tool for effective gene therapy trials against neurological disorders through enhanced retrograde delivery.

In an attempt to elucidate this problem, we investigated the role of canine auditory core and belt areas in auditory recognition. Either core or posterior belt areas were surgically removed. The core and belt regions were defined on the basis of response properties and thalamocortical connectivity established in previous studies. The animals were tested on auditory delayed matching to sample (DMS, a recognition memory task) using complex, trial-unique auditory stimuli. Both core and belt lesions impaired auditory recognition, however, the underlying deficit was different. Lesions to the core areas impaired auditory localization abilities. Lesions to the posterior belt areas did not affect this component of the recognition task, but affected auditory quality discrimination and/or recognition. The deficit following the posterior belt lesion did not increase with retention delay, suggesting that auditory belt areas do not constitute a substrate for auditory recognition memory. Their main function appears to be processing of complex sound patterns, including immediate recognition.",auditory core; auditory belt; recognition memory; dog; lesion; FREQUENCY-MODULATED SOUNDS; TO-SAMPLE TASK; POSTERIOR ECTOSYLVIAN GYRUS; MEDIAL GENICULATE-BODY; TEMPORAL CORTEX; CORTICAL-LESIONS; RHESUS-MONKEY; VISUAL-DISCRIMINATION; HIPPOCAMPAL-LESIONS; THALAMIC AFFERENTS

Presumptive perirhinal or sensorimotor areas of the cerebral wall were removed as slabs from embryonic day 12 (E12), E13, or E14 rats and transplanted heterotopically into either rostral perirhinal or sensorimotor cortical areas of neonatal rats. Two weeks later, the afferent cortical connections of the grafts were labeled by placing DilC(18)-3 (Dil) into each transplant site. Both the E12 and E13 heterotopic transplants of presumptive perirhinal cortex contain mostly precursor cells. When these grafts are placed into sensorimotor cortex, callosal connections are formed primarily with the contralateral sensorimotor (Sml) area, the normal projection of Sml cortex. In contrast, the E14 heterotopic transplants of the perirhinal cortical wall, containing many more postmitotic neurons, developed contralateral connections with both sensorimotor and rostral perirhinal cortices. Thus, when precursor cells are transplanted heterotopically, by using E12/E13 donor tissue, the grafts receive projections that are similar to those of the host cortical area. When older cortical neurons, together with precursors, are transplanted into a heterotopic cortical area, by using E14 donor tissue, their cortical connections exhibit both host and original donor phenotypes. The data are consistent with our previous analysis of thalamocortical connections of grafts (Barbe and Levitt, 1992b) and suggest the existence of a cell-cell recognition system for thalamocortical and corticocortical circuit formation, whose mechanisms of action may be linked to the timing of neurogenesis.",NEURAL GRAFT; SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; PERIRHINAL CORTEX; CELL FATE; CELL SPECIFICATION; AND CORTICAL CONNECTIONS; CALLOSAL PROJECTION NEURONS; SOMATIC SENSORY CORTEX; FETAL RHESUS-MONKEY; CAT STRIATE CORTEX; RETINAL AXONS; POSTNATAL-DEVELOPMENT; CORTICAL-NEURONS; SUBPLATE NEURONS; VISUAL-CORTEX; MOTOR CORTEX

The goal of this study was to examine the in vivo changes in the DBS electrode impedance that Occur after implantation and during clinically relevant stimulation. Clinical DBS devices typically apply high-frequency voltage-controlled stimulation, and as a result, the injected Current is directly regulated by the impedance of the electrode-tissue interface. We monitored the impedance of scaled-down clinical DBS electrodes implanted in the thalamus and subthalamic nucleus of a rhesus macaque using electrode impedance spectroscopy (EIS) measurements ranging from 0.5 Hz to 10 kHz. To further characterize our measurements, equivalent circuit models of the electrode-tissue interface were used to quantify the role of various interface components in producing the observed electrode impedance. Following implantation, the DBS electrode impedance increased and a semicircular arc was observed in the high-frequency range of the EIS measurements, commonly referred to as the tissue component of the impedance. Clinically relevant stimulation produced a rapid decrease in electrode impedance with extensive changes in the tissue component. These post-operative and stimulation-induced changes in impedance could play an important role in the observed functional effects of voltage-controlled DBS and should be considered during clinical stimulation parameter selection and chronic animal research studies.",nan; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; TISSUE IMPEDANCE; UNIT RECORDINGS; INTERFACE; DISORDERS; RESPONSES; DYSTONIA; CULTURES

In the process, neurons can either achieve a more efficient stimulus representation, or extract some biologically important stimulus parameter, or succeed at both. We recorded the inputs from single retinal ganglion cells and the outputs from connected lateral geniculate neurons in the macaque to examine how visual signals are relayed from retina to cortex. We found that geniculate neurons re-encoded multiple temporal stimulus features to yield output spikes that carried more information about stimuli than was available in each input spike. The coding transformation of some relay neurons occurred with no decrement in information rate, despite output spike rates that averaged half the input spike rates. This preservation of transmitted information was achieved by the short-term summation of inputs that geniculate neurons require to spike. A reduced model of the retinal and geniculate visual responses, based on two stimulus features and their associated nonlinearities, could account for >85% of the total information available in the spike trains and the preserved information transmission. These results apply to neurons operating on a single time-varying input, suggesting that synaptic temporal integration can alter the temporal receptive field properties to create a more efficient representation of visual signals in the thalamus than the retina.",nan; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; RECEPTIVE-FIELD; RETINOGENICULATE TRANSMISSION; VISUAL INFORMATION; GANGLION-CELLS; NEURONS; PRIMATE; CAT; ADAPTATION; RESPONSES

Both the magnocellular (M)- and the parvocellular (P)-cell populations scale allometrically with brain volume in primates, P cells with a significantly higher slope such that, for every increase in M neuron number, P neuron numbers more than double (ln scale; y=0.89x+2.42R(2)=0.664). In diurnal primates, the ratio of P to M cells was slightly but significantly higher than in nocturnal primates. For all mammals, including primates, LGN volume was unrelated to nocturnal or diurnal niche but showed marked differences in slope and intercept depending on taxonomic group. The allometric scaling of M and P cells can be related to the order of neurogenesis, with late-generated P cells increasing with positive allometry compared with the earlier-generated M cells. This developmental regularity links relative foveal representation to relative isocortex enlargement, which is also generated late. The small increase in the P/M cell ratio in diurnal primates may result from increased developmental neuron loss in the M-cell population as it competes for limited termination zones in primary visual cortex.

We have placed deposits of distinguishable fluorescent tracers at multiple restricted sites in CGp and have analyzed the distribution throughout the forebrain of neurons labeled by retrograde transport. Cortical projections to CGp arise (in approximately descending order of strength) from anterior cingulate cortex; prefrontal cortex and premotor areas including the frontal eye fields; visual areas including especially areas 7 and 20b; parahippocampal areas; insular cortex; somesthetic areas; and auditory areas. Corticocortical pathways are organized topographically with respect to the posterior-anterior axis in CGp. Projections from prefrontal cortex and other areas with complex (as opposed to sensory, motor, or limbic) functions are concentrated posteriorly; projections from visual and oculomotor areas are concentrated at an intermediate level; and projections from areas with somesthetic and somatomotor functions are concentrated anteriorly. Thalamic projections to CGp arise from the anterior nuclei (AD, AV, and AM), from restricted portions of the ventral complex (VAd, VAm, and VMP), from discrete sectors of the lateral complex (LD, LPs, and LPm), from the rostral crescent of intralaminar nuclei (CM, PC, and CL), and from the reuniens nucleus. Projections from AM, VAd, LD, and LPs are spatially ordered in the sense that more ventral thalamic neurons project to more anterior cortical sites. Projections from AV and AD are stronger at more posterior cortical sites but do not show other signs of topographic ordering. Projections from LPm, CM, PC, CL, and RE are diffuse. We conclude (1) that cortical afferents of CGp derive predominantly from neocortical areas including those with well established sensory and motor functions; (2) that limbic projections to CGp originate primarily in structures, including the hippocampus, which are associated with memory, as opposed to structures, including the amygdala, which are associated with emotional and instinctual behavior; and (3) that CGp contains subregions in which complex, ocular, or somatic afferents predominate.",CINGULATE; RETROSPLENIAL; CONNECTIONS; CAT; AUDITORY ASSOCIATION AREAS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; THALAMIC AFFERENTS; EYE-MOVEMENTS; LIMBIC CORTEX; FRONTAL-LOBE; PHYSIOLOGICAL-PROPERTIES; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; AMYGDALOID COMPLEX

How is information from the cortex transmitted to the periphery? We used two parallel approaches to map simultaneously multiple pathways to determine if hypothalamic autonomic centres are a key link for orbitofrontal areas and medial prefrontal areas, which have been associated with emotional processes, as well as low-level spinal and brainstem autonomic structures. The latter innervate peripheral autonomic organs, whose activity is markedly increased during emotional arousal. Results: We first determined if pathways linking the orbitofrontal cortex with the hypothalamus overlapped with projection neurons directed to the intermediolateral column of the spinal cord, with the aid of neural tracers injected in these disparate structures. We found that axons from orbitofrontal and medial prefrontal cortices converged in the hypothalamus with neurons projecting to brainstem and spinal autonomic centers, linking the highest with the lowest levels of the neuraxis. Using a parallel approach, we injected bidirectional tracers in the lateral hypothalamic area, an autonomic center, to label simultaneously cortical pathways leading to the hypothalamus, as well as hypothalamic axons projecting to low-level brainstem and spinal autonomic centers. We found densely distributed projection neurons in medial prefrontal and orbitofrontal cortices leading to the hypothalamus, as well as hypothalamic axonal terminations in several brainstem structures and the intermediolateral column of the spinal cord, which innervate peripheral autonomic organs. We then provided direct evidence that axons from medial prefrontal cortex synapse with hypothalamic neurons, terminating as large boutons, comparable in size to the highly efficient thalamocortical system. The interlinked orbitofrontal, medial prefrontal areas and hypothalamic autonomic centers were also connected with the amygdala. Conclusions: Descending pathways from orbitofrontal and medial prefrontal cortices, which are also linked with the amygdala, provide the means for speedy influence of the prefrontal cortex on the autonomic system, in processes underlying appreciation and expression of emotions.",nan; MONKEY MACACA-FASCICULARIS; RHESUS-MONKEY; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; EFFERENT PROJECTIONS; MACAQUE MONKEY; POSTERIOR HYPOTHALAMUS; CORTICAL PROJECTIONS; GABAERGIC PROJECTION; AMYGDALOID COMPLEX; CENTRAL NUCLEUS

A technique is then presented for using these density functions to estimate global connectivity (i.e., the probability of the existence of a connection through the data field, between any two distant points), allowing for the quantification of belief in tractography results.

The distribution of the 5-HT-positive cells and the pattern of 5-HT innervation resembled those described in other mammalian species but several differences were also noticed. The nine B groups of DAHLSTROM and FUXE (1964) were observed, except for the B4 group which was not detected in the hedgehog. Neuron-like immunoreactive cells were also observed in brain regions located outside the brainstem reticular formation. Among the latter the olfactory tubercle and the thalamus have not been described to contain 5-HT cell bodies in other mammals. The number and the ''lateralization'' of 5-HT-positive neurons in areas outside the midline raphe were more limited than those described in the rodents and much more limited than in the carnivores and the primates. 5-HT-positive axons were unevenly distributed throughout the hedgehog's CNS.

Two main aspects are elaborated. The first is the evolution of visual projections from the midbrain to the telencephalon, featuring the encephalization of visual functions. Associated to this, the progressive fusion of the two main visual systems (thalamofugal and tectofugal) in the mammalian telencephalon (striate and extrastriate cortex, respectively) is viewed in the context of increasing cortico-cortical connectivity in the evolution of the mammalian brain. In addition, the issue of a presumed homology between mammalian extrastriate cortex and reptilian anterior dorsal ventricular ridge (ADVR) is reviewed in some detail, and it is concluded that extrastriate cortex is a derived character of mammals while ADVR is a derived character of reptiles and birds. It is not likely that ADVR is ancestral to extrastriate cortex. The second aspect under analysis is the origin of the inverted (inside-out) lamination pattern of mammalian neocortex that differs from the outside-in pattern of reptilian cortex. Furthermore, mammals have developed a transient embryonic cell layer (the subplate zone) that serves as a waiting compartment for thalamic and cortico-cortical axons while their prospective target cells end their migration process to reach their finals positions. It is postulated that both, inverted lamination and the subplate zone arose in evolution as successive and complementary strategies to maximize synaptic contacts between thalamic afferents and the new cortical cell types (belonging to prospective granular and supragranular layers) that were being originated at that moment.",nan; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; ORGANIZATION; NEURONS; SYSTEMS; IRREVERSIBILITY; BLINDSIGHT; NEOCORTEX; ONTOGENY; CELL

It has long been assumed that cone opponent ganglion cells project to the parvocellular layers of the geniculate. Here, we examine the role of a third subdivision of the geniculocortical pathway: the interlaminar or koniocellular geniculate relay cells. We made extracellular recordings in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of the common marmoset Callithrix jacchus, a New World monkey in which the interlaminar cells are well segregated from the parvocellular layers. We found that one group of colour opponent cells, the blue-on cells, was largely segregated to the interlaminar zone. This segregation was common to dichromatic ('red-green colour-blind') and trichromatic marmosets.

The post-surgical in-life was restricted to 3 weeks in order to minimize immunotoxicity expected to arise from expression of GFP in antigen-presenting cells. Three main findings emerged from this work. First, the volume over which AAV9 expression was distributed (Ve) was substantially greater than the volume of distribution of MRI signal (Vd). This stands in contrast with Ve/Vd ratio of rAAV2, which is lower under similar conditions. Second, post-mortem analysis revealed expression of GFP in thalamic and cortical neurons as well as dopaminergic neurons projecting from substantia nigra pars compacta, indicating retrograde transport of AAV9. However, fibers in the substantia nigra pars reticulata, a region that receives projections from putamen, also stained for GFP, indicating anterograde transport of AAV9 as well. Finally, one hemisphere received a 10-fold lower dose of vector compared with the contralateral hemisphere (1.5 x 10(13) vg ml(-1)) and we observed a much stronger dose effect on anterograde-linked than on retrograde-linked structures. These data suggest that AAV9 can be axonally transported bi-directionally in the primate brain. This has obvious implications to the clinical developing of therapies for neurological disorders like Huntington's or Alzheimer's diseases.",nan; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; HERPES-SIMPLEX-VIRUS; CONVECTION-ENHANCED DELIVERY; ADENOASSOCIATED VIRUS; GENE-TRANSFER; RABIES VIRUS; VECTORS; NEURONS; THERAPEUTICS; PLATFORM

This paper explores these anatomic substrates, namely, the incorporation of the associative and paralimbic cerebral areas into the cerebrocerebellar circuitry in nonhuman primates. Using the novel information that has emerged concerning this system, proposed rules are derived and specific hypotheses offered concerning cerebellar function and the relationship between cerebellum and nonmotor behavior, as follow. (1) The associative and paralimbic incorporation into the cerebrocerebellar circuit is the anatomic underpinning of the cerebellar contribution to cognition and emotion. (2) There is topographic organization of cognitive and behavioral functions within the cerebellum. The archicerebellum, vermis, and fastigial nucleus are principally concerned with affective and autonomic regulation and emotionally relevant memory. The cerebellar hemispheres and dentate nucleus are concerned with executive, visual-spatial, language, and other mnemonic functions. (3) The convergence of inputs from multiple associative cerebral regions to common areas within the cerebellum facilitates cerebellar regulation of supramodal functions. (4) The cerebellar contribution to cognition is one of modulation rather than generation. Dysmetria of (or ataxic) thought and emotion are the clinical manifestations of a cerebellar lesion in the cognitive domain. (5) The cerebellum performs the same computations for associative and paralimbic functions as it does for the sensorimotor system. These proposed rules and the general and specific hypotheses offered in this paper are testable using functional neuroimaging techniques. Neuroanatomy and functional neuroimaging may thus be mutually advantageous in predicting and explaining new concepts of cerebellar function.

Recent transcriptomic studies have provided opportunities for monitoring and modulating selected subpopulations of these cells. Analyses of mouse lines expressing reporter genes have demonstrated novel, extracortical subplate neurogenesis and have shown how subplate cells are integrated under the influence of sensory activity into cortical and extracortical circuits.

This is made up of the ''system of the basal ganglia'' itself plus its inputs and outputs. The system of rile basal ganglia may be divided into the ''basal ganglia core'' comprising the striatum and its pallidal and nigral targets and the ''regulators of the core''. Distinguishable include regulators of the striatum (the dopaminergic pars compacta and the central complex of the thalamus or centre median-parafascicularis), regulators of the pallidonigrum (the subthalamic nucleus and the pedunculopontine complex) and internal regulators (at first the lateral nucleus of the pallidum). The main input to this system comes from the cerebral cortex. The main output is the thalamus and from it to the cortex. The whole ''basal ganglia related system'' may thus be seen as a cortico-cortical circuit passing through the basal ganglia. Information processing in the system is very complex. New data presented here emphasize two connections: cortico-striate and striato-pallidonigral connections. It is stressed that the first uses complex combinations of confluence or difluence on small matricial islands. This step could be a selection and reorganisation of cortical information. The second process is a strong ''dynamically focused convergence'' combining information from different upstream sources in order to derive an adequate informational product for the production of harmonious and adaptated matricity.",nan; PRIMATE GLOBUS PALLIDUS; FRONTAL EYE FIELD; STRIATAL MICROEXCITABLE ZONES; MEDIAN-PARAFASCICULAR COMPLEX; PRECENTRAL MOTOR CORTEX; MONKEY CAUDATE NEURONS; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; SUBSTANTIA NIGRA; MACAQUE MONKEY; RHESUS-MONKEY

Their origin is linked to transient post-stimulus responses of visual neurons. The receptive fields (RFs) of these subcortical ON- and OFF-center neurons exhibit antagonistic interactions between central and surrounding visual space, resulting in selectivity for stimulus polarity and size. These two features are closely intertwined, yet their relationship to negative afterimage perception remains unknown. Here we tested whether size differentially affects the perception of bright and dark negative afterimages in humans of both sexes, and how this correlates with neural mechanisms in subcortical ON and OFF cells. Psychophysically, we found a size-dependent asymmetry whereby dark disks produce stronger and longer-lasting negative afterimages than bright disks of equal contrast at sizes >0.8 degrees. Neurophysiological recordings from retinal and relay cells in female cat dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus showed that subcortical ON cells exhibited stronger sustained post-stimulus responses to dark disks, than OFF cells to bright disks, at sizes >1 degrees. These sizes agree with the emergence of center-surround antagonism, revealing stronger suppression to opposite-polarity stimuli for OFF versus ON cells, particularly in dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. Using a network-based retino-geniculate model, we confirmed stronger antagonism and temporal transience for OFF-cell post-stimulus rebound responses. A V1 population model demonstrated that both strength and duration asymmetries can be propagated to downstream cortical areas. Our results demonstrate how size-dependent antagonism impacts both the neuronal post-stimulus response and the resulting afterimage percepts, thereby supporting the idea of perceptual RFs reflecting the underlying neuronal RF organization of single cells.",illusion; negative afterimage; perceptive field; receptive field; retina; thalamus; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; THALAMIC RETICULAR NUCLEUS; RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; INPUT X-CELLS; SPATIAL SUMMATION; VISUAL-CORTEX; SINGLE UNITS; MACAQUE V1; CAT; NEURONS

Unfortunately, this definition is not consistently used, and it obscures distinct connectional and functional systems within the orbital cortex. It is difficult to interpret data on the orbital cortex that do not take these different systems into account. Analysis of cortico-cortical connections between areas in the orbital and medial prefrontal cortex indicate two distinct networks in this region. One system, called the orbital network, involves most of the areas in the central orbital cortex. The other system, has been called the medial prefrontal network, though it is actually more complex, since it includes areas on the medial wall, in the medial orbital cortex, and in the posterolateral orbital cortex. Some areas in the medial orbital cortex are involved in both networks. Connections to other brain areas support the distinction between the networks. The orbital network receives several sensory inputs, from olfactory cortex, taste cortex, somatic sensory association cortex, and visual association cortex, and is connected with multisensory areas in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex and perirhinal cortex. The medial network has outputs to the hypothalamus and brain stem and connects to a cortical circuit that includes the rostral part of the superior temporal gyrus and dorsal bank of the superior temporal sulcus, the cingulate and retrosplenial cortex, the entorhinal and posterior parahippocampal cortex, and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex.",architectonic areas; medial prefrontal cortex; corticocortical connections; mediodorsal thalamus; ventral striatum; periaqueductal gray; medial prefrontal network; orbital prefrontal network; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MEDIODORSAL THALAMIC NUCLEUS; MACAQUE MONKEYS; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; FRONTAL-CORTEX; ARCHITECTONIC SUBDIVISION; DIFFERENTIAL CONNECTIONS; AFFERENT CONNECTIONS; LONGITUDINAL COLUMNS

Cortico-cortical connections provide the basis for recognition of 'medial' and 'orbital' networks within the OMPFC. These networks also have distinct connections with structures in other parts of the brain. The orbital network receives sensory inputs from several modalities, including olfaction, taste, visceral afferents, somatic sensation and vision, which appear to be especially related to food or eating. In contrast, the medial network provides the major cortical output to visceromotor structures in the hypothalamus and brainstem. The two networks have distinct connections with areas of the striatum and mediodorsal thalamus. In particular, projections to the nucleus accumbens and the adjacent ventromedial caudate and putamen arise predominantly from the medial network. Both networks also have extensive connections with limbic structures. Based on these and other observations, the OMPFC appears to function as a sensory-visceromotor link, especially for eating. This linkage appears to he critical for the guidance of reward-related behavior and for setting of mood. Imaging and histological observations on human brains indicate that clinical depressive disorders are associated with specific functional and cellular changes in the OMPFC, including activity and volume changes, and specific changes in the number of glial cells.",nan; MIDBRAIN PERIAQUEDUCTAL GRAY; MEDIODORSAL THALAMIC NUCLEUS; MACAQUE MONKEYS; RHESUS-MONKEY; FRONTAL-CORTEX; CORTICAL PROJECTIONS; AFFERENT CONNECTIONS; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; TOPOGRAPHICAL ORGANIZATION; EFFERENT PROJECTIONS

This cortical area is known to be involved in spatial working memory. Many neurons in restricted regions of the dentate nucleus of the cerebral and in the internal segment of the globus pallidus were labeled by transneuronal transport of visus from area 46. The location of these neurons was different from those labeled after HSV1 transport from motor areas of the cerebral cortex.

Three animals were analyzed. In two, biotin dextran amine was used as tracer; in the third, Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin was used. Identification of the tongue area was carried out by electrical brain stimulation. Intracortical projections were found into the neighboring primary motor cortex, ventral premotor cortex, frontoopercular cortex, and primary and secondary somatosensory cortex. Projections also ended in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, orbital cortex, supplementary motor area, anterior cingulate cortex and agranular as well as granular insula. In addition, weaker labeling was found in the inferior and dorsal parietal cortex, and perirhinal and inferotemporal cortex. Subcortically, there was a heavy projection into the ventral putamen, a moderate projection into the caudate nucleus and claustrum, and a weak projection into the anterior, central and lateral amygdala. In the thalamus, terminal labeling was found in the nuclei ventralis posterior medialis, ventralis lateralis, reticularis, centralis lateralis, medialis dorsalis, pulvinaris oralis, centrum medianum, reuniens and suprageniculatus in an order of intensity. Subthalamically, weak projections could be traced into the zona incerta and lateral hypothalamus. In the midbrain, labeling was found in the deep layers of the colliculus superior, area praetectalis, dorsal reticular formation and, very sparsely, in the periaqueductal gray. In the lower brainstem, fibers ended in the griseum pontis, medial and lateral parabrachial nuclei, lateral pontine and medullary reticular formation, paramedian and dorsal reticular nuclei, solitary tract nucleus and principal as well as spinal trigeminal nuclei. No terminals were found in the hypoglossal nucleus itself; there were, however, terminals in the immediately bordering reticular formation. Copyright (C) 2002 S.

Forward connections are involved in the representation of retinal images, whereas feedback pathways may play a role in the selection and interpretation of visual information. To examine the synaptic mechanisms of forward and feedback connections between primary and secondary visual cortical areas directly, we have performed intracellular recordings in slices of rat visual cortex. Irrespective of stimulus intensity and membrane potential, 78% (45/58) of the cells in striate cortex activated by feedback input showed monosynaptic responses that were depolarizing only, and inhibitory inputs were evident merely as a slight acceleration in the decay of EPSPs. In contrast, in 89% (17/19) of the cells, stimulation of forward input evoked monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), followed by disynaptic, hyperpolarizing inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs). EPSPs followed by IPSPs also were recorded after stimulation of local connections within primary visual cortex (92%, 12/13) and after activation of thalamocortical input (91%, 10/11). These results suggest that the synaptic organization of feedback connections are distinct from forward, local, and thalamocortical circuits. The findings further indicate that intracortical back projections exert modulatory influences via synaptic mechanisms in which weak inhibitory input is strongly dominated by excitation.",visual cortex; forward circuit; feedback circuit; synaptic mechanisms; inhibition; excitation; MONKEY CEREBRAL-CORTEX; BOUQUET CELL AXONS; MACAQUE MONKEY; STRIATE CORTEX; POSTSYNAPTIC POTENTIALS; CORTICOCORTICAL CONNECTIONS; ORIENTATION SELECTIVITY; HORIZONTAL CONNECTIONS; CORTICAL CONNECTIONS; LATERAL INTERACTIONS

Manipulating visual experience in kittens by the induction of squint leads to the emergence of ocular dominance columns with a Larger size and larger column-to-column spacing than in normally raised animals. The mechanism underlying this phenomenon is presently unknown. Theory suggests that experience cannot influence the spacing of columns if the development proceeds through purely Hebbian mechanisms. Here we study a developmental model in which Hebbian mechanisms are complemented by activity-dependent regulation of the total strength of afferent synapses converging onto a cortical neurone. We show that this model implies an influence of visual experience on the spacing of ocular dominance columns and provides a conceptually simple explanation for the emergence of larger sized columns in squinting animals. Assuming that during development cortical neurones become active in local groups, which we call co-activated cortical domains (CCDs), ocular dominance segregation is controlled by the size of these groups: (1) Size and spacing of ocular dominance columns are proportional to the size sigma of CCDs. (2) There is a critical size sigma* of CCDs such that ocular dominance columns form if sigma < <sigma>* but do not form spontaneously if sigma > sigma*. This critical size of CCDs is determined by the correlation functions of activity patterns in the two eyes and specifies the influence of experience on ocular dominance segregation. We show that sigma* is larger with squint than with normal visual experience. Since experimental evidence indicates that the size of CCDs decreases during development, ocular dominance columns are predicted to form earlier and with a larger spacing in squinters compared to normal animals.

Both positron emission tomography (PET) probes were evaluated in the brain of conscious monkey (Macaca mulatta) using high-resolution PET. Time-activity curves (TACs) of [C-11](R,R)HAPT peaked within 5 min after the injection in all regions except the caudate and putamen, both of which showed peaks around 20 min postinjection. The regional distribution patterns of [C-11](R,R)HAPT determined as total distribution volume (V-t) were highest in the putamen, high in the caudate, intermediate in the amygdala, hippocampus, and thalamus, lower in the cingulate gyrus and frontal, temporal, and occipital cortices, and lowest in the cerebellum. In contrast, the distribution and TACs of [C-11](S,S)HAPT were homogeneous in all regions. The uptake of [C-11](R,R)HAPT was reduced by 1 mg/kg (-)-vesamicol, a specific VAChT antagonist, in all regions except the cerebellum, but not by 0.1 mg/kg SA4503, a specific sigma-1 receptor agonist. These results well reflect the in vitro affinity assessments using rat cerebral membranes. They also demonstrate that [C-11](R,R)HAPT is a potential PET probe for noninvasive and quantitative imaging of VAChT in the living brain. Synapse 68:283-292, 2014.

All 4 circuits were replicated and dissociated in an independent data set (n = 40). Direct comparison of right- and left-seeded frontal regions revealed contralateral lateralization in the cerebellum for each of the segregated circuits. The presence of circuits that involve prefrontal regions confirms that the cerebellum participates in networks important to cognition including a specific fronto-cerebellar circuit that interacts with the default network.

Four to five days after virus injections into M1, we observed many densely labeled neurons in localized regions of the output nuclei of the cerebellum and basal ganglia. The largest numbers of these neurons were found in portions of the dentate nucleus and the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPI). Smaller numbers of labeled neurons were found in portions of the interpositus nucleus and the substantia nigra pars reticulata. The distribution of neuronal labeling varied with the cortical injection site. For example, within the dentate, neurons labeled from leg M1 were located rostrally, those from face M1 caudally, and those from arm M1 at intermediate levels. In each instance, labeled neurons were confined to approximately the dorsal third of the nucleus. Within GPI, neurons labeled from leg M1 were located in dorsal and medial regions, those from face M1 in ventral and lateral regions, and those from arm M1 in intermediate regions. These results demonstrate that M1 is the target of somatotopically organized outputs from both the cerebellum and basal ganglia, Surprisingly, the projections to M1 originate from only 30% of the volume of the dentate and <15% of GPI, Thus, the majority of the outputs from the cerebellum and basal ganglia are directed to cortical areas other than M1.",primary motor cortex; cerebellum; basal ganglia; thalamus; transneuronal transport; herpes simplex virus; primate; motor control; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; MACAQUE MONKEY; PSEUDORABIES VIRUS; MACACA-MULATTA; PALLIDOTHALAMIC PROJECTIONS; NUCLEOCORTICAL PROJECTION; THALAMIC PROJECTIONS; EFFERENT CONNECTIONS; ANATOMICAL EVIDENCE

Tracer studies in adult macaques have shown that the basolateral subnuclei differentially connect to parts of visual cortex, with stronger connections to anterior regions and weaker connections to posterior regions; infant macaques show robust connectivity even with posterior visual regions. Do these developmental differences also exist in the human amygdala, and are there specific functional regions that undergo the most pronounced developmental changes in their connections with the amygdala? To address these questions, we explored the functional connectivity (from resting-state fMRI data) of the basolateral amygdala to occipitotemporal cortex in human neonates scanned within one week of life and compared the connectivity patterns to those observed in young adults. Specifically, we calculated amygdala connectivity to anterior-posterior gradients of the anatomically-defined occipitotemporal cortex, and also to putative occipitotemporal functional parcels, including primary and high-level visual and auditory cortices (V1, A1, face, scene, object, body, high-level auditory regions). Results showed a decreasing gradient of functional connectivity to the occipitotemporal cortex in adults-similar to the gradient seen in macaque tracer studies-but no such gradient was observed in neonates. Further, adults had stronger connections to high-level functional regions associated with face, body, and object processing, and weaker connections to primary sensory regions (i.e., A1, V1), whereas neonates showed the same amount of connectivity to primary and high-level sensory regions. Overall, these results show that functional connectivity between the amygdala and occipitotemporal cortex is not yet differentiated in neonates, suggesting a role of maturation and experience in shaping these connections later in life.",nan; HUMAN CONNECTOME PROJECT; PRIMATE AMYGDALA; THALAMIC STRUCTURES; VISUAL-CORTEX; BRAIN; FEAR; MRI; PERCEPTION; INFANT; NEUROBIOLOGY

Only a few previous studies have been concerned with the distribution of the subtypes of EAA receptor binding in the primate brain. We examined NMDA- and quisqualate-sensitive [H-3]glutamate binding using quantitative autoradiography in monkey brain (Macaca fascicularis). The two types of binding were differentially distributed. NMDA-sensitive binding was most dense in dentate gyrus of hippocampus, stratum pyramidale of hippocampus, and outer layers of cerebral cortex. Quisqualate-sensitive binding was most dense in dentate gyrus of hippocampus, inner and outer layers of cerebral cortex, and molecular layer of cerebellum. In caudate nucleus and putamen, quisqualate- and NMDA-sensitive binding sites were nearly equal in density. However, in globus pallidus, substantia nigra, and subthalamic nucleus, quisqualate-sensitive binding was several-fold greater than NMDA-sensitive binding. In thalamus, [H-3]glutamate binding was generally low for both subtypes of binding except for the anterior ventral, lateral dorsal, and pulvinar nuclei. In the brainstem, low levels of binding were found, and strikingly the red nucleus and pons, which are thought to receive glutamatergic projections, had approximately 1/20 the binding observed in cerebral cortex. These results demonstrate that NMDA- and quisqualate-sensitive [H-3]glutamate binding are observed in all regions of primate brain, but that in some regions one subtype predominates over the other.

However, knowledge of the reversibility of these neurotoxic effects based on in vivo evaluations of serotonin transport (SERT) availability remains limited. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term neurotoxicity of MDMA after 66 months abstinence and explored whether Dextromethorphan, a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, could attenuate MDMA-induced neurotoxicity using 4-[F-18]-ADAM, an imaging ligand that selectively targets SERT, with positron emission tomography technology (PET). Nine monkeys (Macaca cyclopis) were used in this study: control, MDMA, and DM + MDMA. Static 4-[F-18]-ADAM PET was performed at 60 and 66 months after drug treatment. Serotonin transport (SERT) availability was presented as the specific uptake ratios (SURs) of 4-[F-18]-ADAM in brain regions. Voxel-based region-specific SERT availability was calculated to generate 3D PET/MR images. Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) volumetric analysis was also conducted at 60 months. Significantly decreased 4-[F-18]-ADAM SURs were observed in the striatum and thalamus of the MDMA group at 60 and 66 months compared to controls; the midbrain and frontal cortex SURs were similar at 60 and 66 months in the MDMA and control groups. All eleven brain regions showed significantly lower (similar to 13%) self-recovery rates over time; the occipital cortex and cingulate recovered to baseline by 66 months. DM attenuated MDMA-induced SERT deficiency on average, by similar to 8 and similar to 1% at 60 and 66 months, respectively; whereas significant differences were observed between the thalamus and amygdala of the MDMA and DM + MDMA groups at 66 months. Compared to controls, the MDMA group exhibited significantly increased (similar to 6.6%) gray matter volumes in the frontal cortex, occipital cortex, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, midbrain, and amygdala. Moreover, the gray matter volumes of the occipital cortex, hippocampus and amygdala correlated negatively with the 4-[F-18]-ADAM SURs of the same regions. DM (n = 2) did not appear to affect MDMA-induced volumetric changes.

It is involved in high order association functions that include the integration of emotion, behavior, and various sensory processes. To define the cyto- and chemo-architectonic organization of the human orbitofrontal cortex, we have used antibodies to the nonphosphorylated neurofilament triplet protein and to the calcium-binding proteins parvalbumin and calretinin. Immunohistochemistry revealed labeling patterns corresponding to the cytoarchitecture defined by Nissl preparations. Neurofilament protein-immunoreactive pyramidal neurons were located only in layers V-VI in the agranular posterior orbitofrontal cortex, whereas they were distributed in both layers III and V-VI in the anteromedial and anterolateral granular regions. The intermediate dysgranular portion of the orbitofrontal cortex represented a transition zone with a progressive decrease in layer III labeled pyramidal cell numbers posteriorly. The distribution of parvalbumin- and calretinin-immunoreactive interneurons was more homogeneous, although the posteromedial region and the cortex of the inferior rostral sulcus had slightly lower parvalbumin-positive neuron counts than the other orbitofrontal areas. Parvalbumin immunoreactivity in the neuropil exhibited a high degree of regional specialization in that it was consistently less intense in the cortex of the intermediate and posterior part of the gyrus rectus, whereas the other orbitofrontal areas had a very dense neuropil staining in layers III to V. Also, there was a dense plexus of parvalbumin-immunoreactive fibers restricted to layer I in the posterolateral orbitofrontal cortex, and patches of neuropil staining in layer III of the inferior rostral sulcus. These region-specific neuropil staining patterns may correspond to the distribution of parvalbumin-immunoreactive thalamocortical projections to distinct domains of the orbitofrontal cortex. This regional parcellation of the human orbitofrontal cortex as defined by specific neuronal markers, may represent an anatomical substrate for the localization of the various functions attributed to this poorly understood cortical region.

One circuit mediates motor function, another eye movements, and three of the circuits mediate cognitive, emotional, and motivational processes. The circuits serve as organizational axes integrating related information from widespread areas of the brain and mediating diverse behaviors. This review describes the anatomy of the circuits and the major transmitters present within the circuits. Circuit-specific behaviors (those that appear to be mediated exclusively by circuit structures) and circuit-related behaviors (those that involve both circuit and noncircuit structures) are discussed.

The microinjections were centered on layer V, and 42 anterogradely labeled corticofugal axons were reconstructed from serial frontal or sagittal sections with a camera lucida. Our investigation shows that the primate striatum receives both direct and indirect projections from M1. The direct corticostriatal projection is formed by axons that remain uniformly thin and unbranched throughout their sinuous trajectory to the ipsilateral striatum. They divide as they enter the dorsolateral sector of the postcommissural putamen, the so-called sensorimotor striatal territory. The indirect corticostriatal projection derives from a thin collateral emitted within the corona radiata by thick, long-range fibers that descend toward the brainstem. The collateral enters the putamen dorsomedially and remains unbranched until it reaches the dorsolateral sector of the putamen, where it breaks out into two to four axonal branches displaying small and equally spaced varicosities. Both direct and indirect corticostriatal axons branch moderately but occupy vast rostrocaudal striatal territories, where they appear to contact en passant several widely distributed striatal neurons. These findings reveal that, in contrast to current beliefs, the primate motor corticostriatal system is not exclusively formed by axons dedicated solely to the striatum. It also comprises collaterals from long-range corticofugal axons, which can thus provide to the striatum a copy of the neural information that is being conveyed to the brainstem and/or spinal cord.",basal ganglia; primary motor cortex; single-cell labeling; axonal collateralization; corticostriatal projections; MONKEY MACACA-FASCICULARIS; FRONTAL EYE FIELD; BASAL GANGLIA; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; PYRAMIDAL TRACT; MACAQUE MONKEY; EFFERENT CONNECTIONS; FUNCTIONAL-ANATOMY; CORTICAL INPUTS; CORTICOTHALAMIC FIBERS

Thus, AAV serotype 2 (AAV2) is anterogradely transported (e.g., from cell bodies to nerve terminals) in both rat and non-human primate (NHP) brain. In contrast, AAV serotype 6 (AAV6) is retrogradely transported from terminals to neuronal cell bodies in the rat brain. However, the directionality of axonal transport of AAV6 in the NHP brain has not been determined. In this study, two Cynomolgus macaques received an infusion of AAV6 harboring green fluorescent protein (GFP) into the striatum (caudate and putamen) by magnetic resonance (MR)-guided convection-enhanced delivery. One month after infusion, immunohistochemical staining of brain sections revealed a striatal GFP expression that corresponded well with MR signal observed during gene delivery. As shown previously in rats, GFP expression was detected throughout the prefrontal, frontal and parietal cortex, as well as the substantia nigra pars compacta and thalamus, indicating retrograde transport of the vector in NHP. AAV6-GFP preferentially transduced neurons, although a few astrocytes were also transduced. Transduction of non-neuronal cells in the brain was associated with the upregulation of the major histocompatibility complex-II and lymphocytic infiltration as previously observed with AAV1 and AAV9. This contrasts with highly specific neuronal transduction in the rat brain. Retrograde axonal transport of AAV6 from a single striatal infusion permits efficient transduction of cortical neurons in significant tissue volumes that otherwise would be difficult to achieve.",AAV6; MRI guided; convection-enhanced delivery; axonal transport; Huntington's disease; CONVECTION-ENHANCED DELIVERY; VECTOR

A critical node in this network is the posterior cingulate, precuneal, and retrosplenial cortices. The cytological and neurochemical composition of this region is reviewed in relation to the Brodmann map. This region has the highest level of cortical glucose metabolism and cytochrome c oxidase activity. Monkey studies suggest that the anterior thalamic projection likely drives retrosplenial and posterior cingulate cortex metabolism and that the midbrain projection to the anteroventral thalamic nucleus is a key coupling site between the brainstem system for arousal and cortical systems for cognitive processing and awareness. The pivotal role of the posterior cingulate, precuneal, and retrosplenial cortices in consciousness is demonstrated with posterior cingulate epilepsy cases, midcingulate lesions that de-afferent this region and are associated with unilateral sensory neglect, observations from stroke and vegetative state patients, alterations in blood flow during sleep, and the actions of general anesthetics. Since this region is critically involved in self reflection, it is not surprising that it is similarly a site for the NNCC. Interestingly, information processing during complex cognitive tasks and during aversive sensations such as pain induces efforts to terminate self reflection and result in decreased processing in posterior cingulate and precuneal cortices.",nan; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; CEREBRAL BLOOD-FLOW; VEGETATIVE STATE; FUNCTIONAL NEUROANATOMY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; RHESUS-MONKEY; BRAIN; CORTEX; MEMORY; SELF

While its connectivity mapping in the cortex displays a broad topographic organization, its projections are also marked by considerable convergence and divergence. As a result, the pulvinar is often regarded as a central forebrain hub. Moreover, new evidence suggests that its comparatively modest input from structures such as the retina and superior colliculus may critically shape the functional organization of the visual cortex, particularly during early development.

Interposed between these two sites is a large transitional field. We have earlier demonstrated experimentally in rats with H-3-thymidine autoradiography that this transitional field is a stratified structure composed of discrete layers of migrating and sojourning cells, and fiber bands. Here we show that the different layers of the stratified transitional field are identifiable without experimental procedures in the developing human cerebral cortex and that there are conspicuous regional differences in its stratification. At the peak of its development, the stratified transitional field contains three fibrous bands in an inside-out order: the commissural fibers of the corpus callosum, the thalamocortical and corticofugal projection fibers, and the expanding white matter. There are regional differences in the thickness of these fibrous layers as well as in the number and configuration of the perikaryal layers. This preview focuses on laminar differences of the transitional fields of the agranular frontal lobe and the granular parietal and occipital lobes. At the latter sites, but not in the frontal lobe, there is a distinctive multi-layered band, the honeycomb matrix, where radially oriented fiber columns are sandwiched between two perikaryal sublayers and are separated from one another by radially oriented cells. We postulate that the radial fiber columns of the honeycomb matrix are composed of topographically organized thalamocortical fibers and that the unspecified young neurons acquire their enduring topographic identity by making selective contacts with tagged fibers here before they resume their radial or tangential migration to the cortical plate.",nan; FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE; MACAQUE MONKEY; CELL MIGRATION; VISUAL-CORTEX; NEOCORTEX; ORGANIZATION; ZONES

These are important for the accurate location of visual objects in extrapersonal space, It can be predicted that these areas will show increased activation during the performance of eye movements at high frequency. In the present study PET and measurements of the regional distribution of cerebral blood flow (rCBF) were used as indirect measures of neural activity. Two independent groups of normal volunteers performed large-amplitude self-generated eye movements in complete darkness, thus removing the confounding effects of visual stimulation on parietooccipital activation. The first group (group A; n = 5) served as a hypothesis-generating group and the second group (group B; n = 4) served as a hypothesis-testing group, The data were analysed using statistical parametric mapping at a significance level corrected for multiple comparisons (group A, Z > 4.08; group B, Z > 4.04), Significant rCBF increases were found for both groups in the frontal eye fields, supplementary eye fields, cerebellar vermis and putamina/thalami. Additionally, activation was found in the cunei in the posterior bank of the parieto-occipital sulcus, Also, the extraocular muscles were activated and, as a consequence of the partial volume effect, projected to the orbitofrontal cortices, At a less conservative threshold, activation was found close to the intraparietal sulci on the left side (Z = 3.91, P = 0.09) and right side (Z = 3.33, P = 0.42), The locations of these areas were confirmed in group B with reference to high-resolution structural MRI scans. The activation of the parieto-occipital cortex without overt visual stimuli is interpreted as the result of neural activity related to the reception of efferent copies of motor commands and/or the activation of neurons coding for eye position relative to the orbits.

This classification is supported by the. finding that response linearity is bimodally distributed across neurons in area V1 of anesthetized animals. However, recent studies suggest that such bimodal distribution may not reflect two neuronal types but a nonlinear relationship between the membrane potential and the spike output. A main limitation of these previous studies is that they measured response linearity in anesthetized animals, where the distance between the neuronal membrane potential and the spike threshold is artificially increased by anesthesia. Here, we measured V1 response linearity in the awake brain and its correlation with the neuronal spontaneous. ring rate, which is related to the distance between membrane potential and threshold. Our results demonstrate that response linearity is bimodally distributed in awake V1 but that it is poorly correlated with spontaneous. ring rate.

In previous studies, electroacupuncture (EA) with 2/15 Hz has been shown to enhance the sedative effects in general anesthesia patients. Central lateral thalamic stimulation of 50 Hz showed an arousal effect in macaques. Therefore, it is worth studying the sedative effect of EA at peripheral acupoints with different frequencies, especially the frequency of around 50 Hz. Methods. Rats were anesthetized under the constant infusion of propofol and EA at Zusanli (ST36) and Neiguan (PC6) locations. Electroencephalography (EEG) and heart rate were continuously recorded before and after the intervention by EA in the C group (control), LEA group (low-frequency group, 2/15 Hz diffuse/dense wave EA stimulation), and HEA group (high-frequency group, 50 Hz stimulation). Results. In the LEA group, a significant increase in the power of the delta component with a decrease in the alpha component p < 0.05 was observed after EA stimulation. In the HEA group, significant increases in the powers of alpha and beta components of EEG p < 0.05 and a decrease in the delta component of EEG were observed p < 0.05. The phenomenon is also shown in full-frequency waves. In addition, a significant decrease in the low-frequency/high-frequency ratio parameter was observed in the LEA group. Conclusions. EA at bilateral ST36 and PC6 can enhance the sedative effects of propofol anesthesia in low-frequency stimulation but lighten the sedative effects in high-frequency (50 Hz) stimulation. The sympathetic-vagal balance was affected due to low-frequency EA.",nan; CORTICAL EFFECTIVE CONNECTIVITY; BISPECTRAL INDEX; BLOOD-PRESSURE; ACUPUNCTURE; BRAIN; CONSCIOUSNESS; STIMULATION; BREAKDOWN; SURGERY; SLEEP

Both auditory and visual warning stimuli activated the midbrain. thalamus, and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) extending to the pre-supplementary motor area (pre-SMA). The warning-related activation in the pre-SMA and thalamus was greater when warnings were followed by Go events with faster reaction times than when followed by events with slower reaction times. The midbrain, thalamus. and ACC are known to be associated with vigilance or intrinsic alertness, and the pre-SMA is involved in movement selection and preparation.

Previously, we have reported on development and preclinical validation of F-18-Fluselenamyl, comprising traits of translatable A beta imaging agents. Herein, we report the dosimetry data for F-18-Fluselenarnyl to provide radiation dose deposited within organs and determine effective dose (ED) for human studies, while also evaluating its pharmacokinetics in the nonhuman primate brains. Methods: To evaluate safety profiles of F-18-Fluselenamyl for enabling its deployment as a PET imaging agent for monitoring A beta pathophysiology in vivo, we estimated the human radiation dosimetry extrapolated from rodent biodistribution data obtained by standard method of organ dissection. Animal biodistribution studies were performed in FVB/NCR mice (20 males, 20 females), following tail-vein injection of the tracer. Following euthanasia of mice, organs were harvested, counted, radiation dose to each organ and whole body was determined using the standard MIRD methodology. For evaluation of pharmacokinetics in non-human primates, following intravenous injection of the tracer, dynamic PET scan of rhesus monkey brains were performed, and co-registered with MR for anatomical reference. Parametric images of tracer transport rate constant and distribution volume relative to cerebellum were generated using a simplified reference tissue model and a spatially-constraint linear regression algorithm. Results: The critical organ in humans has been determined to be the gall bladder with a gender average radiation absorbed dose of 0.079 mGy/MBq with an effective dose of 0.017 mSv/MBq and 0.020 mSv/MBq, in males and females, respectively. Therefore, these data provide preliminary projections on human dosimetry derived from rodent estimates, thereby defining safe imaging conditions for further validations in human subjects. Additionally, the tracer penetrated the non-human primate brain and excreted to background levels at later-time points thus pointing to the potential for high signal/noise ratios during noninvasive imaging. Tissue time activity curves (TACs) also show fast initial uptake with maximum projection of activity at 2-6 min post administration followed by clearance of activity at later time-points from cortex, cerebellum, and white matter of nonhuman primate brain. Parametric images confirmed that the F-18-Fluselenamyl has relative high transport rate constant at striatum, thalamus, and cortex. Conclusions: The data obtained from radiation dosimetry studies in mice indicate that F-18-Fluselenamyl can be safely used for further evaluation in humans. Additionally, F-18-Fluselenamyl demonstrated ability to traverse the blood brain barrier (BBB) and indicated high initial influx, followed by clearance to background levels in non-human primate brains. Combined information indicates that F-18-Fluselenamyl would be a potential candidate for detecting amyloid plaques in the living human brain. (C) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Division of labor in frontal eye field neurons during presaccadic remapping of visual receptive fields. J Neurophysiol 108: 2144-2159, 2012. First published July 18, 2012; doi:10.1152/jn.00204.2012.-Our percept of visual stability across saccadic eye movements may be mediated by presaccadic remapping. Just before a saccade, neurons that remap become visually responsive at a future field (FF), which anticipates the saccade vector. Hence, the neurons use corollary discharge of saccades. Many of the neurons also decrease their response at the receptive field (RF). Presaccadic remapping occurs in several brain areas including the frontal eye field (FEF), which receives corollary discharge of saccades in its layer IV from a collicular-thalamic pathway. We studied, at two levels, the microcircuitry of remapping in the FEF. At the laminar level, we compared remapping between layers IV and V. At the cellular level, we compared remapping between different neuron types of layer IV. In the FEF in four monkeys (Macaca mulatta), we identified 27 layer IV neurons with orthodromic stimulation and 57 layer V neurons with antidromic stimulation from the superior colliculus. With the use of established criteria, we classified the layer IV neurons as putative excitatory (n = 11), putative inhibitory (n = 12), or ambiguous (n = 4). We found that just before a saccade, putative excitatory neurons increased their visual response at the RF, putative inhibitory neurons showed no change, and ambiguous neurons increased their visual response at the FF. None of the neurons showed presaccadic visual changes at both RF and FF. In contrast, neurons in layer V showed full remapping (at both the RF and FF). Our data suggest that elemental signals for remapping are distributed across neuron types in early cortical processing and combined in later stages of cortical microcircuitry.",vision; saccades; perception; microcircuitry; MONKEY SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; BRAIN-STEM TELLS; INHIBITORY NEURONS; PYRAMIDAL CELLS; FUNCTIONAL-PROPERTIES; RESPONSE PROPERTIES; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; STRIATE CORTEX; SIGNALS SENT; IN-VIVO

Some specific considerations concerning synaptic boutons in cat visual cortex,"To understand the rules by which axons lay down their synaptic boutons we analyzed the linear bouton distributions in 39 neurons (23 spiny, 13 smooth) and 3 thalamic axons, which were filled intracellularly with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) during in vivo experiments in cat area 17. The variation of the total number of boutons and the total axonal length was large (789-7912 boutons, 12-126 mm). The overall linear bouton density for smooth cells was higher than that of spiny cells and thalamic afferents (mean +/- sd, 110 +/- 21 and 78 +/- 27 boutons per mm of axonal length). The distribution of boutons varied according to their location on the tree. Distal axon collaterals (first and second order segments in Horton-Strahler ordering) of smooth neurons had a 3.5 times higher, spiny cells and thalamic afferents a 2 times higher bouton density compared to the higher order (more proximal) segments. The distribution of interbouton intervals was positively skewed and similar for cells of the same type.

During each fixation, in addition to analyzing the object at which we are looking, a decision has to be made as to where to look next. Although we perform this task with the greatest of ease, the computations to perform the task are complex and involve numerous brain structures. We have applied several investigative tools that include single-cell recordings, microstimulation, pharmacological manipulations and lesions to learn more about the neural control of visually guided eye saccadic movements. Electrical stimulation of the superior colliculus (SC), areas V1 and V2, the lateral intraparietal sulcus (LIP), the frontal eye fields (FEF) and the medial eye fields (MEF) produces saccadic eye movements at low current levels. After ablation of the SC, electrical microstimulation of V1, V2, and LIP no longer elicits saccadic eye movements whereas stimulation of the FEF and MEF continues to be effective. Ablation of the SC but not of the FEF eliminates short-latency saccadic eye movements to Visual targets called express saccades, whereas lesions of the FEF selectively interfere with target selection. Bilateral removal of both the SC and the FEF causes major, long lasting deficits: all visually elicited saccadic eye movements are eliminated. In intact monkeys, subthreshold electrical microstimulation of the FEF and MEF as well as the lower layers of V1 and V2 and of some subregions of LIP greatly facilitates the choice of targets presented in the receptive fields of the stimulated neurons. By contrast, stimulation of the upper layers of V1 and V2 and other sub-regions of LIP produces a dramatic interference in target selection. Examination of the role of inhibitory circuits in eye-movement generation reveals that local infusion of muscimol, a GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) agonist, or bicuculline, a GABA antagonist, interferes with target selection in V1. On the other hand, infusion of bicuculline into the FEF produces facilitation in target choice and irrepressible saccades. It appears therefore that inhibitory circuits play a central role in visual analysis in V1 and in the generation of saccadic eye movements in the FEF. It is proposed that two major streams can be discerned in visually guided eye-movement control, the posterior from occipital and parietal cortex that reaches the brainstem via the SC and the anterior from the FEF and MEF that has direct access to the brainstem oculomotor centers.",nan; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; SINGLE-CELL PROPERTIES; MONKEY STRIATE CORTEX; DORSOMEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; RHESUS-MONKEY; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; MACAQUE MONKEY; STIMULATION

Nevertheless, we have found that their one-dimensional metrics and topologies are surprisingly similar. To discover this, we analysed the axonal branching pattern of 39 neurons (23 spiny, 13 smooth and three thalamic axons) that were filled intracellularly with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) during in vivo experiments in cat area 17. The axons were completely reconstructed and translated into dendrograms. Topological, fractal and Horton-Strahler analyses indicated that axons of smooth and spiny neurons had similar complexity, length ratios (a measure of the relative increase in the length of collateral segments as the axon branches) and bifurcation ratios (a measure of the relative increase in the number of collateral segments as the axon branches). We show that a simple random branching model (Galton-Watson process) predicts with reasonable accuracy the bifurcation ratio, length ratio and collateral length distribution of the axonal arbors.",cell types; dendrogram; 3D reconstruction; fractal analysis; Galton-Watson branching process; Horton-Strahler method; PYRAMIDAL CELLS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; STRIATE CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; NEURONS; ARBORIZATIONS; ORGANIZATION; ORIENTATION; CONNECTIONS; PRINCIPLES

GAD-like immunoreactivity (GAD-LI) was assessed in the retina, in primary retinorecipient targets, and in thalamic nuclear groups postsynaptic to primary retinal terminal zones. Within the retina, the inner plexiform layer displayed intense GAD-LI, but immunoreactivity was absent in the ganglion cell layer (GCL). Putative amacrine, bipolar, and horizontal cell somata were also labeled. Centrally, GAD-LI was observed in all primary visual nuclei. Dense, GAD-like immunoreactive punctate structures (puncta), presumably terminals, were observed in the pretectal nucleus lentiformis mesencephali, posterior thalamic neuropil, and uncinate neuropil. GAD-like immunoreactive puncta were noted in several laminae of the optic tectum, with the highest concentrations located within the 9th and 8th laminae. Moderate numbers of CAD-like immunoreactive puncta were found in the mesencephalic nucleus of the basal optic root, and two thalamic neuropils-corpus geniculatum and neuropil of Bellonci. The ventrolateral area, posterocentral nucleus, and posterolateral nucleus all contained sparse amounts of GAD-LI. These observations suggest that GABA plays an important physiological role in all central visual areas of Rana pipiens.

We found that these areas receive major disynaptic inputs from specific portions of the cerebellar nuclei, the ventral dentate (D), and ventrolateral interpositus posterior (IP). Area LIPv receives inputs from oculomotor domains of the caudal D and IP. Area MIP is the target of projections from the ventral D (mainly middle third), and gaze- and arm-related domains of IP involved in reaching and arm/eye/head coordination. We also showed that cerebellar cortical output channels to MIP predominantly stem from posterior cerebellar areas (paramedian lobe/Crus II posterior, dorsal paraflocculus) that have the required connectivity for adaptive control of visual and proprioceptive guidance of reaching, arm/eye/head coordination, and prism adaptation. These findings provide important insight about the interplay between the posterior parietal cortex and the cerebellum regarding visuospatial adaptation mechanisms and visual and proprioceptive guidance of movement.

We applied a structural equation method to regional receptor binding. The results indicated that the network models of the patients and normal subjects were significantly different. As to the individual path coefficients, (a) connectivity between cortical regions was different between groups; (b) connectivity from the prefrontal cortex, parietal cortex, and thalamus to the anterior cingulate differed from that in controls; and (c) connectivity from the prefrontal cortex to the anterior cingulate and thalamus via the hippocampus was observed in normal subjects but not in patients.

Temporal and spectral features of click trains are differentially encoded in A1. Encoding of temporal features occurs at rates of 100-200 Hz through phase-locked activity in the MUA and CSD, is independent of pulse polarity pattern, and occurs in high best frequency (BF) regions of A1. The upper limit of ensemble-wide phase-locking is about 400 Hz in the input to A1, as manifested in the cortical middle laminae CSD and MUA of thalamocortical fibers. In contrast, encoding of spectral features occurs in low BF regions, and resolves both the f(0) and harmonics of the stimuli through local maxima of activity determined by the tonotopic organization of the recording sites. High-pass filtered click trains decrease spectral encoding in low BF regions without modifying phase-locked responses in high BF regions. These physiological responses parallel features of human pitch perception for click trains, and support the existence of two distinct physiological mechanisms involved in pitch perception: the first using resolved harmonic components and the second utilizing unresolved harmonics that is based on encoding stimulus waveform periodicity.

J. Neurophysiol. 82: 1876-1882, 1999. The purpose of the present investigation was to examine, in the primate, the role of the postsynaptic dorsal column (PSDC) system and that of the spinothalamic tract (STT) in viscerosensory processing by comparing the responses of neurons in these pathways to colorectal distension (CRD). Experiments were done on four anesthetized male monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). Extracellular recordings were made from a total of 100 neurons randomly located in the L(6)S(1) segments of the spinal cord. Most of these neurons had cutaneous receptive fields in the perineal area, on the hind limbs or on the rump. Forty-eight percent were PSDC neurons activated antidromically from the upper cervical dorsal column or the nucleus gracilis, 17% were STT neurons activated antidromically from the thalamus, and 35% were unidentified. Twenty-one PSDC neurons, located mostly near the central canal, were excited by CRD and three were inhibited. Twenty-four PSDC neurons, mostly located in the nucleus proprius, did not respond to CRD. Of the 17 STT neurons, 7 neurons were excited by CRD, 4 neurons were inhibited, and 6 neurons did not respond to CRD. Of the unidentified neurons, 23 were excited by CRD, 7 were inhibited, and 5 did not respond. The average responses of STT and PSDC neurons excited by CRD were comparable in magnitude and duration. These results suggest. that the major role of the PSDC pathway in viscerosensory processing may be due to a quantitative rather than a qualitative neuronal dominance over the STT.",nan; SACRAL SPINAL-CORD; NOXIOUS VISCERAL STIMULUS; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; COLORECTAL DISTENSION; NUCLEUS GRACILIS; RESPONSES; RAT; PATHWAY; CELLS; PAIN

Subthalamotomy resulted in a bilateral improvement of tremor spontaneous activity, bradykinesia (evaluated by a manual motor test) and freezing in Group C. All these monkeys developed hemichorea contralateral to the lesion. The improvement was maintained and the hemichorea continued until death. The monkeys in group D showed severe hemiballism which persisted throughout MPTP administration and developed parkinsonian signs mainly on the side ipsilateral to the lesion. Analysis of the in situ hybridization of the mRNA coding for glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) of MPTP monkeys showed a significant increase in the mean density of silver grains over every labelled neuron in the globus pallidum lateralis (56.8% over control) as well as the globus pallidus medialis (GPM) (45.7% over control) and the substantia nigra reticulata (SNR) (35.8% over control). No significant change was observed in the thalamic nucleus reticular's. Subthalamotomy (Groups C and D) produced a significant reduction in mRNA GAD expression on the side of the lesion in the GPM and the SNR (34% and 42.3%, respectively) with respect to the ipsilateral (non-lesioned) side and also when compared with parkinsonian monkeys.

A series of non-amine-bearing aryloxatropanes that are potent inhibitors of the dopamine transporter (DAT) challenged this precept. In the present study, we investigated the brain distribution of a selective, high-affinity DAT non-amine, [H-3] tropoxene (2-carbomethoxy-3,4dichloro-3-aryl-8-oxabicyclo[3.2.1] octene), which binds to the DAT in monkey striatum. The autoradiographic distribution of [H-3]tropoxene was conducted in tissue sections of rhesus (Macaca mulatta) monkey brain. Highest accumulation of the radioligand was detected in the putamen and caudate nucleus, with significant levels also observed in the nucleus accumbens and substantia nigra. Moderate to low levels of [H-3]tropoxene binding were noted in the hypothalamus, amygdala, ventral tegmental area, and thalamus. The distribution of [H-3]tropoxene was restricted to brain regions previously identified as expressing DAT, and the relative densities of [H-3]tropoxene binding sites in various brain regions corresponded to those observed with other selective monoamine radioligands for the DAT. This is the first; report to demonstrate that transporter-selective compounds that bear no amine nitrogen in their structure bind selectively to brain regions rich in the transporter. The results support our conclusion that an amine nitrogen is not necessary for compounds to bind to monoamine transporters and distribute in brain according to the known distribution of transporters. The findings provide further incentives to investigate the pharmacological potential of transport inhibitors lacking an amine nitrogen in the molecular structure.

In order to optogenetically investigate the large and complex primate brain, an optical-/electrical probe, or optrode, must be inserted deeply, which requires the optrode to be not only long and stiff, but also sharp and smooth to reduce possible tissue damage. This study presents a tungsten microelectrode-based optrode that encloses optical fibers within its insulation glass. Optical fibers and a tungsten wire were tightly bound to each other and integrally coated with a smooth, thin layer of glass. This design satisfied the structural requirements for use in deep brain structures. The performance of the optrode was then examined in the thalamus of the rat and macaque monkeys which were injected with lentiviral vectors carrying the channelrhodopsin-2-enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (ChR2-EYFP) transgene. With fluorescence measurements via the optical fiber, ChR2-EYFP expression was detected clearly in vivo, which was confirmed by histological analysis in the rat. With photostimulation and extracellular recording, photo-responsive single-unit activities were isolated in the monkeys. The depth distribution of these units and the peak of the EYFP fluorescence profile overlapped consistently with each other. Thus, by developing a new probe, optogenetic methodology was successfully applied to a primate subcortical structure. This smooth glass-coated optrode is a promising tool for chronic in vivo experiments with various research targets including deep brain structures in behaving monkeys. (C) 2012 Elsevier B.V.

The retinohypothalamic tract (RHT) in the monkey projects to the SCN, the anterior and lateral hypothalamic areas, and the retrochiasmatic area in a pattern very similar to that in the rat. The monkey SCN has a population of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide-containing (VIP+) neurons in a zone that overlaps the RHT termination and the termination of neuropeptide Y-containing (NPY+) axons arising in the IGL. This zone is surrounded by a population of vasopressin-containing (VP+) neurons. The human SCN is similar to that of other mammals with populations of VIP+ and VP+ neurons, but it differs in having a large population of neurotensin-containing (NT+) neurons that extends over the entire nucleus, and a moderate population of NPY+ neurons located centrally in the nucleus in the presumed area of RHT termination. The lateral geniculate nucleus in the monkey and human is quite different from that in rodents, but contains an area in the pregeniculate nucleus that receives bilateral retinal projections in the monkey and is characterized in both the monkey and human by a population of NPY+ neurons and a plexus of enkephalin- and substance P-containing axons.

We summarize results from three groups of PET studies of regional CBF. The results show a double dissociation between (i) selection of movements, which induces differential effects in the basal ganglia but nor the cerebellum, and (ii) sensory information processing, which involves the cerebellum but not the basal ganglia. The first set of studies concerned motor learning of a sequence of finger movements; there was a shift of activation in the anterior-posterior direction of the basal ganglia which paralleled changes in the motor areas of the frontal cortex. During new learning, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and striatum (caudate nucleus and anterior putamen) were activated. When subjects had to select movements, the premotor cortex and mid-putamen were activated. With automatic (overlearned) movements, the sensorimotor cortex and posterior putamen were activated. When subjects paid attention to overlearned actions, activation shifted back to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and striatum. The cerebellum was not activated when subjects made new decisions, attended to their actions or selected movements. These results demonstrate components of basal ganglia-(thalamo)-cortical loops in humans. According to earlier studies in animals we propose that the basal ganglia may be concerned with selecting movements or the selection of appropriate muscles to perform a movement selected by cortical areas (e.g. premotor cortex). Secondly, a visuomotor co-ordination task was examined. In the absence of visual control over arm movements, subjects were required to use a computer mouse to either generate new lines or to re-trace lines on a computer screen. The neocerebellum (hemispheres of the posterior lobe, cerebellar nuclei and cerebellar vermis), not the basal ganglia, was more engaged when lines were re-traced (compared with new line generation). Animal experiments have shown that error detection (deviation from given lines) and correction occurs during line re-tracing but not line generation. Our data suggest that the neocerebellum (not the basal ganglia) is involved in monitoring and optimizing movements using sensory (proprioceptive) feedback. Thirdly, the relative contribution of sensory information processing to the signal during active/passive execution of a motor task (flexion and extension of the elbow) was examined; it was found that 80-90% of the neocerebellar signal could be attributed to sensory information processing. The basal ganglia were not involved in sensory information processing. They may be concerned with movement/muscle selection (efferent motor component); the neocerebellum may be concerned with monitoring the outcome (afferent sensory component) and optimizing movements using sensory (feedback) information.",basal ganglia; cerebellum; movement control; CEREBRAL BLOOD-FLOW; POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; MOTOR CONTROL; PASSIVE MOVEMENTS; RHESUS-MONKEY; SPINAL PROJECTIONS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; BASIS PONTIS; PET IMAGES; ANATOMY

In the current study we reveal features of the organization of the pulvinar complex in galagos by examining superior colliculus (SC) projections to this structure and comparing them with staining patterns of the vesicular glutamate transporter, VGLUT2. Cholera toxin subunit (CTB), Fluoro-ruby (FR), and wheat germ agglutinin conjugated with horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) were placed in topographically different locations within the SC. Our results showed multiple topographically organized patterns of projections from the SC to several divisions of the pulvinar complex. At least two topographically distributed projections were found within the lateral region of the pulvinar complex, and two less obvious topographical projection patterns were found within the caudomedial region, in zones that stain darkly for VGLUT2. The results, considered in relation to recent observations in tree shrews and squirrels, suggest that parts of the organizational scheme of the pulvinar complex in primates are present in rodents and other mammals.

The figures of rCBV and rCBF can clearly demonstrate the hemodynamic differences in various cerebral parts. It has been noted that rCBV and rCBF values have no significant difference between the right and left hemisphere (P > 0.05). The values of rCBF from cerebral cortex were significantly higher than that of white matter (P < 0.05). The values of rCBF were different (P < 0.05) at frontal cortex, parietal cortex and occipital cortex. However, the highest value has been observed in occipital cortex compared with the others (P < 0.05). We observed higher correlation coefficient between the rCBF and rCBV (r = 0.92, P < 0.05). Results from this study show that the hemodynamic characteristics of healthy adult rhesus are similar to those of normal human studies. Moreover, the blood flow of cortex is found significantly higher than white matter and there was different flow perfusion among different parts, as the occipital cortex showed the highest value and frontal cortex the lowest value.",nan; BLOOD-FLOW; QUANTIFICATION; ISOFLURANE; RESONANCE; FMRI

Intramuscular (i.m.) in the forelimb; 2. I.m. in the hindlimb; 3. Subcutaneous (s.c.) in the abdominal wall; 4. Intraperitoneal (i.p.). Spread of virus was followed by immunohistochemical demonstration of viral antigen in tissue sections of the peripheral and central nervous system. Three distinct patterns emerged: 1. After i.m. limb inoculations, virus progressed along the ipsilateral dorsal column, the bilateral spinothalamic and bilateral spinoreticular systems and along central autonomic pathways. 2. After s.c. inoculation, the dorsal column was spared, otherwise the spread was similar to that following i.m. inoculations. 3. After i.p. inoculation, virus spread in the spinal cord bilaterally, mainly along spinothalamic and central autonomic pathways. The peripheral motoneurons were conspicuously spared, even in the i.m. inoculation mode. In the brain stem, B virus antigen appeared bilaterally, at multiple sites. In the cerebrum, virus infected cells appeared first in the thalamus, hypothalamus and the motor cortex. The mode of spread from spinal levels was mainly orthograde along the ascending systems (dorsal columns, spinothalamic, spinoreticular tracts), but also retrograde along descending systems (pyramidal tract, central autonomic pathways). Oligosynaptic systems transmitted virus more quickly than the polysynaptic ones. In the involvement of various neuronal systems in virus spread, a certain selectivity, sparing the peripheral motoneuron and the cerebellar systems, could be assessed.",TRANSSYNAPTIC (TRANSNEURONAL) VIRUS SPREAD; AXONAL SPREAD OF VIRUS; HERPES VIRUSES; SPINAL CORD; SENSORY SYSTEMS; NEUROANATOMY; RHESUS MONKEYS (MACAQUES); VIRAL PATHOGENESIS; CENTRAL AUTONOMIC PATHWAYS; CENTRAL NERVOUS-SYSTEM; SIMPLEX VIRUS; SPINAL-CORD; BRAIN-STEM; RAT; NEURONS; TYPE-1; INOCULATION; CELLS; PATHOGENESIS

In rodents V1 two ranges within the gamma band are sensitive to contrast: a broad gamma band (BB) increasing with contrast, and a narrow gamma band (NB), peaking at similar to 60 Hz, decreasing with contrast. The functional roles of the two bands and the neural circuits originating them are not completely clear yet. Here, we show, combining experimental and simulated data, that in mice V1 (1) BB carries information about high contrast and NB about low contrast; (2) BB modulation depends on excitatory-inhibitory interplay in the cortex, while NB modulation is because of entrainment to the thalamic drive. In awake mice presented with alternating gratings, NB power progressively decreased from low to intermediate levels of contrast where it reached a plateau. Conversely, BB power was constant across low levels of contrast, but it progressively increased from intermediate to high levels of contrast. Furthermore, BB response was stronger immediately after contrast reversal, while the opposite held for NB. These complementary modulations were reproduced by a recurrent excitatory-inhibitory leaky integrateand-fire network provided that the thalamic inputs were composed of a sustained and a periodic component having complementary sensitivity ranges. These results show that in rodents the thalamic-driven NB plays a specific key role in encoding visual contrast. Moreover, we propose a simple and effective network model of response to visual stimuli in rodents that might help in investigating network dysfunctions of pathologic visual information processing.",broad gamma band; local field potential; narrow gamma band; spiking neuronal network; visual contrast; visual cortex; LONG-RANGE SYNCHRONIZATION; FAST NETWORK OSCILLATIONS; FAST-SPIKING INTERNEURONS; SYNAPTIC CONNECTIONS; STIMULUS-DEPENDENCE; FREQUENCY; DYNAMICS; MACAQUE; NEURONS; MODULATION

For this purpose, we developed a novel lentiviral vector that carries the tetracycline transactivator (tTA) and the transgene under the TET Responsive Element promoter (TRE) on a single backbone. By pseudotyping such a vector with modified rabies G-protein, we were able to express palmitoylated-GFP (palGFP) or turboFP635 (RFP) in corticothalamic, corticocortical, and corticopontine neurons of mice. The high-level expression of the transgene achieved by the TET-Off system enabled us to observe characteristic elaboration of neuronal processes for each cell type. At higher magnification, we were able to observe fine structures such as boutons and spines as well. We also injected our retrograde TET-Off vector to the marmoset cortex and proved that it can be used to label the long-distance cortical connectivity of millimeter scale.

The underlying pathophysiology of this is poorly understood, but inflammation is potentially an important factor. Microglia orchestrate many aspects of this response. Their activation can be studied in vivo using the positron emission tomography (PET) ligand [11C](R)PK11195 (PK). In this study, we investigate whether an inflammatory response to TBI persists, and whether this response relates to structural brain abnormalities and cognitive function. Methods: Ten patients, studied at least 11 months after moderate to severe TBI, underwent PK PET and structural magnetic resonance imaging (including diffusion tensor imaging). PK binding potentials were calculated in and around the site of focal brain damage, and in selected distant and subcortical brain regions. Standardized neuropsychological tests were administered. Results: PK binding was significantly raised in the thalami, putamen, occipital cortices, and posterior limb of the internal capsules after TBI. There was no increase in PK binding at the original site of focal brain injury. High PK binding in the thalamus was associated with more severe cognitive impairment, although binding was not correlated with either the time since the injury or the extent of structural brain damage. Interpretation: We demonstrate that increased microglial activation can be present up to 17 years after TBI. This suggests that TBI triggers a chronic inflammatory response particularly in subcortical regions. This highlights the importance of considering the response to TBI as evolving over time and suggests interventions may be beneficial for longer intervals after trauma than previously assumed.

Both similarities and differences were found. Maximal order of branching, branching angles, topological distribution of branches and boutons are similar for all axons, indicating strong constraints in arbor formation. CCC and MTC axons are indistinguishable for total arbor length and number of branches, although these parameters can vary across individual axons of each group. MTC axons have longer and bouton-richer end-branches (the 'transmission compartment') while, in CCC axons, proximal, boutonless branches (the 'conduction compartment') predominate. Therefore, the two classes of axons appear to he specialized for performing different types of operations, in agreement with the available electrophysiological data and computer simulations. Differences in the length of branches were also observed between MTC axons of normal and 'barrelless' mice, suggesting that this parameter can be regulated by conditions at the terminal sites.",nan; CAT VISUAL-CORTEX; INDIVIDUAL X-CELL; STRIATE CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; TERMINAL ARBORS; CALLOSAL AXONS; THALAMOCORTICAL AFFERENTS; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; LAYER-IV; AREA V2

To determine whether a homologous metabolic pattern is also present in nonhuman primate models of parkinsonism, 11 adult macaque monkeys with parkinsonism secondary to chronic systemic 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) and 12 age-matched healthy animals were scanned with [F-18] fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET). A subgroup comprising five parkinsonian and six control animals was used to identify a parkinsonism-related pattern (PRP). For validation, analogous topographies were derived from other subsets of parkinsonian and control animals. The PRP topography was characterized by metabolic increases in putamen/pallidum, thalamus, pons, and sensorimotor cortex, as well as reductions in the posterior parietal-occipital region. Pattern expression was significantly elevated in parkinsonian relative to healthy animals (P < 0.00001). Parkinsonism-related topographies identified in the other derivation sets were very similar, with significant pairwise correlations of region weights (r> 0.88; P < 0.0001) and subject scores (r> 0.74; P < 0.01). Moreover, pattern expression in parkinsonian animals correlated with motor ratings (r> 0.71; P< 0.05). Thus, homologous parkinsonism-related metabolic networks are demonstrable in PD patients and in monkeys with experimental parkinsonism. Network quantification may provide a useful biomarker for the evaluation of new therapeutic agents in preclinical models of PD.

The authors examined the acute effects of propofol on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) using positron emission tomography in patients with severe depression. Methods: in six severely depressed patients (mean age, 55.0 yr) scheduled for electroconvulsive therapy, anesthetic levels were monitored by electroencephalography, and rCBF was serially quantified in the awake, sedated, and anesthetized states. The authors used high-resolution positron emission tomography with O-15-labeled water and statistical parametric mapping 99 for imaging and analysis of the data. Results. Global cerebral blood flow showed sharp decreases from the awake level during the administration of propofol, decreasing 26.8% in the sedated state and 54.4% in the anesthetized state. Moreover, a dose effect was seen in both parietal cortices and the left lateral prefromal region wit h larger regions of relative decrease in rCBF at higher propofol doses. At the higher dose, the values of rCBF in the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus, the pontine tegmentum, and the cerebellar cortex were also affected. Meanwhile, there were few changes of relative rCBF in the basal frontal lobes during both sedated and anesthetized states. Conclusions: As in earlier studies using normal subjects, pronounced suppression in rCBF in the brain stem reticular formation, the thalamus, and the parietal association cortex occurred even in severely depressed patients. However, previously reported decreases in rCBF in the basal frontal lobe were absent in depressed patients.",nan; CEREBRAL BLOOD-FLOW; RETICULAR-FORMATION; RHESUS-MONKEY; BRAIN; HUMANS; ELECTROENCEPHALOGRAM; METABOLISM; VOLUNTEERS; ISOFLURANE; (H2O)-O-15

Based on our dynamics results, we propose that a V1 cell's orientation selectivity is generated mainly by both tuned enhancement and global suppression. Enhancement near the preferred orientation is probably caused by feed-forward input from LGN (plus amplification by cortical-cortical interaction). Global suppression could be supplied by cortical inhibition. Additionally, in about 1/3 of V1 neurons (usually the most sharply tuned) there is tuned suppression, centered near the cell's preferred orientation but broader than tuned enhancement. These mechanisms also can explain important features of steady-state selectivity in the V1 neuron population. Furthermore, similar neuronal mechanisms may be used generally throughout the cerebral cortex.",nan; CAT STRIATE CORTEX; SIMPLE CELLS; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; MACAQUE MONKEY; NETWORK MODEL; DIRECTION SELECTIVITY; THALAMIC INPUT; NEURONS; V1; EXCITATION

The effect of L-dopa has been demonstrated in language studies, suggesting restriction of the semantic network. In this study, we aimed to examine the effect of L-dopa on language processing with fMRI using Independent Component Analysis (ICA). Two types of language tasks (phonological and semantic categorization tasks) were tested under two drug conditions (placebo and L-dopa) in 16 healthy subjects. Probabilistic ICA (PICA), part of FSL, was implemented to generate Independent Components (IC) for each subject for the four conditions and the ICs were classified into task-relevant source groups by a correlation threshold criterion. Our key findings include: (i) The highly task-relevant brain regions including the Left Inferior Frontal Gyrus (LIFG), Left Fusiform Gyrus (LFUS), Left Parietal lobe (LPAR) and Superior Temporal Gyrus (STG) were activated with both L-dopa and placebo for both tasks, and (ii) as compared to placebo, L-dopa was associated with increased activity in posterior regions, including the superior temporal area (BA 22), and decreased activity in the thalamus (pulvinar) and inferior frontal gyrus (BA 11/47) for both tasks. These results raise the possibility that L-dopa may exert an indirect effect on posterior regions mediated by the thalamus (pulvinar).",nan; INFERIOR PREFRONTAL CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; BLIND SEPARATION; WORKING-MEMORY; FUNCTIONAL MRI; HUMAN BRAIN; RETRIEVAL; RECEPTORS; REGIONS

Moreover, it provides an aesthetic component to visual experiences that is fundamental to our perception of the world. Despite the long history of colour vision studies, much has still to be learned about the physiological basis of colour perception. Recent advances in our understanding of the early processing in the retina and thalamus have enabled us to take a fresh look at cortical processing of colour.

However, as response properties of the mechanoreceptive afferent fibers supplying the skin have not been characterized for this primate, the present study was undertaken to classify fibers innervating the glabrous skin of the marmoset hand and determine whether they resembled those described for other mammalian species, including cat, macaque monkey, and human subjects. Forty-seven tactile afferent fibers with receptive fields (RFs) on the glabrous skin of the hand were isolated in fine median and ulnar nerve strands. Controlled tactile stimuli, including static indentation and skin vibration, were used to classify fibers. Twenty-six (55%) responded to static indentation in a sustained manner and were designated slowly adapting (SA) fibers, while 21 (45%) were selectively sensitive to the dynamic components of the stimulus. The SA fibers had well-defined boundaries to their RFs, lacked spontaneous activity in most cases (23/26 fibers), had an irregular pattern of discharge to static skin indentation, and displayed graded response levels as a function of indentation amplitude, attributes that were consistent with the properties of slowly adapting type I (SAI) fibers described in other species. The dynamically sensitive afferent fibers could be subdivided into two distinct functional classes, based on their responses to vibrotactile stimulation. The majority (15/21) responded best to lower frequency vibration (similar to 10-50 Hz) and had small RFs, whereas the second class responded preferentially to higher frequency vibration (50-700 Hz) with maximal sensitivity at similar to 200-300 Hz. These two classes resembled, respectively, the rapidly adapting (RA) and Pacinian corpuscle-related (PC) fiber classes found in other species, and like them, responded to vibration with tightly phase-locked patterns of response over a wide range of frequencies. The results demonstrate that the functional classes of tactile afferent fibers that supply the glabrous skin in the marmoset monkey appear to correspond with those described previously for the cat and macaque monkey, and are similar to those supplying the human hand and fingers, although the SA fibers in the human hand appear to fall into two classes, the SAI and SAII fibers. With the increasing use of the marmoset monkey as a primate model for somatosensory system studies, these data now allow tactile neurons identified at central locations, such as the cerebral cortex and thalamus, to be classified in relation to inputs from the peripheral classes identified in the present study.",nan; SOMATOSENSORY CORTICAL AREA; RAPIDLY ADAPTING MECHANORECEPTORS; STIMULUS-RESPONSE FUNCTIONS; GLABROUS SKIN AREA; CAT HAIRY SKIN; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; SENSORY FIBERS; VIBROTACTILE STIMULATION; REVERSIBLE INACTIVATION; VIBRATORY INFORMATION

We injected rabies into the primary motor cortex (M1) or into Area 46 of cebus monkeys. A 4-day survival time was long enough to allow transport of rabies from the injection site to 'third-order' neurons in the basal ganglia. After either MI or Area 46 injections, third-order neurons were found in the external segment of the globus pallidus (GPe), striatum and subthalamic nucleus (STN). In each of these nuclei, the third-order neurons that innervate M1 were spatially separated from those that innervate Area 46. Thus, distinct basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits innervate M1 and Area 46. Next, we injected a conventional tracer into M1 to define its terminations in the putamen and STN. We found that the regions of the putamen and STN that receive input from M1 are the same as those that contain third-order neurons after M1 injections of virus. On the other hand, virus injections into M1 also labeled a relatively dense group of third-order neurons in a region of the ventral putamen that is not innervated by M1. This region of the putamen is the target of efferents from the amygdala. Thus, the ventral putamen may provide a route for the limbic system to influence motor output.

The regional distribution pattern of [carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635 at 60-91 min postinjection was the highest in the cingulate gyrus and hippocampus, high in the frontal and temporal cortices, lower in the occipital cortex, striatum, thalamus, and raphe nuclei, and lowest in the cerebellum in both young and aged monkeys. Graphical Logan plot analysis with metabolite-corrected plasma radioactivity as an input function into the brain was applied to evaluate 5-HT1A receptor binding in vivo. Significant age-related decreases in 5-HT1A receptor binding were observed only in the frontal and temporal cortices. In the hippocampus, although 5-HT1A receptor binding indicated no significant age-related changes, it showed an inverse correlation with individual cortisol levels in plasma. When the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT was administered intravenously at a dose of 0.1, 0.3, or 1 mg/kg 30 min after tracer injection, binding of [carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635 was displaced in both age groups in a dose-dependent manner. However, the degree of displacement was more marked in young than in aged monkeys. These observations demonstrated the usefulness of [carbonyl-C-11]WAY-100635 as an indicator of the age-related changes in cortical 5-HT1A receptors measured noninvasively by PET. In addition, these observations suggested that the age-related impairment of 5-HT1A receptor responses to 8-OH-DPAT might be related to the reduced efficacy of antidepressant therapy in elderly patients with depression.

Spike trains from sensory cortex neurons can predict trial-to-trial variability in choice. Choice-related spiking is widely studied as a way to link cortical activity to perception, but its origins remain unclear. Using imaging and electrophysiology, we found that mouse primary somatosensory cortex neurons showed robust choice-related activity during a tactile detection task. Spike trains from primary mechanoreceptive neurons did not predict choices about identical stimuli. Spike trains from thalamic relay neurons showed highly transient, weak choice-related activity. Intracellular recordings in cortex revealed a prolonged choice-related depolarization in most neurons that was not accounted for by feed-forward thalamic input. Top-down axons projecting from secondary to primary somatosensory cortex signaled choice. An intracellular measure of stimulus sensitivity determined which neurons converted choice-related depolarization into spiking. Our results reveal how choice-related spiking emerges across neural circuits and within single neurons.",nan; DECISION-RELATED ACTIVITY; SUBJECTIVE SENSORY EXPERIENCE; RAT BARREL CORTEX; IN-VIVO; HEADING PERCEPTION; MOTION DETECTION; DETECTION TASK; MOTOR CORTEX; MACAQUE MT; NEURONS

A tentative scenario including roles of reelin, p35/cdk5 and the subplate zone","This paper proposes an evolutionary hypothesis for the origin of (i) the inside-out pattern of mammalian corticogenesis in which late-generated cells become located more superficially than early-generated cells, and (ii) the predominantly radial organization of isocortical inputs in mammals. It is suggested that an outside-in neurogenetic gradient (in which early-generated cells are located more superficially than late-generated cells), as occurs in reptilian cortex, would have positioned the late-produced, associative neurons (destined to supragranular layers in modern isocortex) below the early-produced output neurons. This may have limited the possibilities of synaptic contacts between the younger cells and the afferent terminals which were located in the more superficial layer I. There was probably an adaptive benefit in those individuals in which rate-produced cells were capable of passing through the layers of already migrated cells, thus making contacts with superficial afferents and generating corticocortical and local circuits that processed the information before producing an output. Reelin, an extracellular glycoprotein found in layer I, and a cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk5) and its neuronal-specific activator (p35) may have played key roles in the generation of the inside-out gradient. Additionally, by serving as a waiting compartment for thalamic axons while the cortical plate develops, the subplate zone may have participated in the change from an emphasis in a tangential arrangement of thalamic terminals that is characteristic of reptilian cortex to the predominantly radial mode of termination that is observed in mammalian isocortex.",nan; CAJAL-RETZIUS CELLS; HEDGEHOG ERINACEUS-EUROPAEUS; NEOCORTICAL LAYER-I; CORTICAL DEVELOPMENT; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; IMMUNOREACTIVE NEURONS; LAMINAR ORGANIZATION; PRENATAL DEVELOPMENT; BRAIN-DEVELOPMENT

Based on neurobiological research, it is generally accepted that most forms of tinnitus are attributable to maladaptive plasticity due to damage to auditory system. Changes have been observed in auditory structures such as the inferior colliculus, the thalamus and the auditory cortex as well as in non-auditory brain areas. However, the observed changes show great variability, hence lacking a conclusive picture. One of the reasons might be the selection of inhomogeneous groups in data analysis. Methodology: The aim of the present study was to delineate the differences between the neural networks involved in narrow band noise and pure tone tinnitus conducting LORETA based source analysis of resting state EEG. Conclusions: Results demonstrated that narrow band noise tinnitus patients differ from pure tone tinnitus patients in the lateral frontopolar (BA 10), PCC and the parahippocampal area for delta, beta and gamma frequency bands, respectively.

This paper briefly reviews some of these findings and provides a personal interpretation of their possible functional significance. Emphasis is placed on the fact that the striatum and the subthalamic nucleus have multiple representations in the two major output structures of the basal ganglia, namely the internal segment of the globus pallidus and the substantia nigra pars reticulata. It is hypothesized that this multiple representation serves as a means of amplifying and diversifying the striatal and subthalamic influences upon thalamocortical neurons that is mediated through the globus pallidus and the substantia nigra. Furthermore, evidence for the highly ordered organization of the striatopallidal and subthalamo-pallidal projections, which converge onto single pallidal neurons according to different but highly specific patterns, is taken as an indication that the subthalamic nucleus uniformly excites a vast collection of pallidal neurons, whereas the striatum exerts a more specific inhibitory control upon selected subsets of subthalamically driven pallidal neurons.",nan; LIGHT MICROSCOPIC ANALYSIS; GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; RHESUS-MONKEY; SPATIAL-ORGANIZATION; EFFERENT PROJECTIONS; NEURONS; CORTEX; IMMUNOREACTIVITY

This study investigated the biodistribution of a serotonin transporter imaging agent, N,N-dimethyl-2-(2-amino-4-F-18-fluorophenylthio)benzylamine (4-[F-18]-ADAM), in nonhuman primate brain using positron emission tomography (PET). Methods: Six and four Macaca cyclopis monkeys were used to determine the transit time (i.e., time necessary to reach biodistribution equilibrium) and the reproducibility of 4-[F-18]-ADAM biodistribution in the brain, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of 4-[F-18]-ADAM binding to SERT were evaluated in one monkey challenged with different doses of fluoxetine and one monkey treated with 3,4-methylendioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). Dynamic PET imaging was performed for 3 h after 4-[F-18]-ADAM intravenous bolus injection. The specific uptake ratios (SURs) in the midbrain (MB), thalamus (TH), striatum (ST) and frontal cortex (FC) were calculated. Results: The distribution of 4-[F-18]-ADAM reached equilibrium 120-150 min after injection. The mean SURs were 2.49 +/- 0.13 in MB, 1.59 +/- 0.17 in TH, 1.35 +/- 0.06 in ST and 0.34 +/- 0.03 in FC, and the minimum variability was shown 120-150 min after 4-[F-18]-ADAM injection. Using SURs and intraclass coefficient of correlation, the test/retest variability was under 8% and above 0.8, respectively, in SERT-rich areas. Challenge with fluoxetin (0.75-2 mg) dose-dependently inhibited the SURs in various brain regions. 4-[F-18]-ADAM binding was markedly reduced in the brain of an MDMA-treated monkey compared to that in brains of normal controls. Conclusion: 4-[F-18]-ADAM appears to be a highly selective radioligand for imaging SERT in monkey brain. (C) 2012 Elsevier Lnc.

Aromatase has been reported to be involved in aggressive behaviours in genetically modified mice and in personality traits by genotyping studies on humans. However, no study has investigated the relationship between aromatase in living brains and personality traits including aggression. We performed a positron emission tomography (PET) study in 21 healthy subjects using C-cetrozole, which has high selectivity and affinity for aromatase. Before performing PET scans, subjects answered the Buss-Perry Aggression Questionnaire and Temperament and Character Inventory to measure their aggression and personality traits, respectively. A strong accumulation of C-cetrozole was detected in the thalamus, hypothalamus, amygdala, and medulla. Females showed associations between aromatase levels in subcortical regions, such as the amygdala and supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus, and personality traits such as aggression, novelty seeking, and self-transcendence. In contrast, males exhibited associations between aromatase levels in the cortices and harm avoidance, persistence, and self-transcendence. The association of aromatase levels in the thalamus with cooperativeness was common to both sexes. The present study suggests that there might exist associations between aromatase in the brain and personality traits. Some of these associations may differ between sexes, while others are likely common to both.",nan; RHESUS-MONKEY BRAINS; AGGRESSION QUESTIONNAIRE; GRAPHICAL ANALYSIS; JAPANESE VERSION; GENE-EXPRESSION; SEXUAL-BEHAVIOR; IN-VIVO; PET; OXYTOCIN; MICE

This region is commonly implicated in higher cognitive functions. Despite the histological distinctiveness of primate dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, the work of Rose, Woolsey, and Akert produced a broad consensus among neuroscientists that homologues of primate granular frontal cortex exist in nonprimates and can be recognized by their dense innervation from the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus (MD). Additional characteristics have come to be identified with dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, including rich dopaminergic innervation and involvement in spatial delayed-reaction tasks. However, recent studies reveal that these characteristics are not distinctive of the dorsolateral prefrontal region in primates: MD and dopaminergic projections are widespread in the frontal lobe, and medial and orbital frontal areas may play a role in delay tasks. A reevaluation of rat frontal cortex suggests that the medial frontal cortex, usually considered to be homologous to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of primates, actually consists of cortex homologous to primate premotor and anterior cingulate cortex. The lateral MD-projection cortex of rats resembles portions of primate orbital cortex. If prefrontal cortex is construed broadly enough to include orbital and cingulate cortex, rats can be said to have prefrontal cortex. However, they evidently lack homologues of the dorsolateral prefrontal areas of primates. This assessment suggests that rats probably do not provide useful models of human dorsolateral frontal lobe function and dysfunction, although they might prove valuable for understanding other regions of frontal cortex.",nan; FRONTAL EYE FIELD; MEDIODORSAL THALAMIC NUCLEUS; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; STREPSIRHINE PRIMATE GALAGO; SUB-CORTICAL PROJECTIONS; MEDIAL AGRANULAR CORTEX; MONKEY MACACA-FASCICULARIS; RHESUS-MONKEY; ASSOCIATION CORTEX; CINGULATE CORTEX

To gain more information on the temporal distribution of SERTs, 2-([2-([dimethylamino]methyl)phenoxyl]thio)-5-[I-123] iodophenylamine (I-123-ADAM) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) was utilized in an in vivo imaging study using non-human primates. Methods Two female monkeys (Macaca cyclopis) were studied. Eight brain SPECT imaging examinations, each 30 min in duration, were obtained after injection of (185) MBq of I-123-ADAM. Images were obtained using a dual-head gamma camera equipped with ultra-high resolution fan-beam collimators. In addition to visual inspection, the radio-uptake and specific uptake ratios (SURs) of midbrain (MB), thalamus (TH), striatum (ST), temporal and frontal cortices and the whole brain in reference to the corresponding magnetic resonance image at the eight time points were measured. The SUR of MB, using cerebellum (CB) as the reference tissue, was calculated as (MB-CB)/CB, in mean counts/pixel. The SURs of the other brain regions were similarly measured. Results There was relatively high uptake of I-123-ADAM in the MB and TH, moderate uptake in ST, lower uptake in the cerebral cortex, and almost no uptake in the CB. The image of MB could be easily identified at the first 30 min time point. It appeared that the SURs of MB, TH and ST reached equilibrium around 210 min after injection. No adverse reactions of the primates were found during and after imaging. Brain distribution of I-123-ADAM in the primate appeared consistent with the known distribution of SERTs. Conclusion In conjunction with a high SUR in MB, TH and ST, we speculate that I-123-ADAM may be a potential radioligand for SPECT studies of serotonin transporters in humans.",I-123-ADAM; serotonin transporter; brain SPECT; non-human primate; BINDING-SITES; RADIOLIGANDS; SYSTEM; PET; RECEPTORS; ADAM

In striatal slices of naive rodents, N/OFQ (0.1-1 mu M) prevented the increase of ERK phosphorylation and the loss of depotentiation of synaptic plasticity induced by the D1 receptor agonist SKF38393 in spiny neurons. In vivo, exogenous N/OFQ (0.03-1 nmol, i.c.v.) or a synthetic N/OFQ receptor agonist given systemically (0.01-1 mg/Kg) attenuated dyskinesias expression in 6-hydroxydopamine hemilesioned rats primed with L-DOPA, without causing primary hypolocomotive effects. Conversely, N/OFQ receptor antagonists worsened dyskinesia expression. In vivo microdialysis revealed that N/OFQ prevented dyskinesias simultaneously with its neurochemical correlates such as the surge of nigral GABA and glutamate, and the reduction of thalamic GABA. Regional microinjections revealed that N/OFQ attenuated dyskinesias more potently and effectively when microinjected in striatum than substantia nigra (SN) reticulata, whereas N/OFQ receptor antagonists were ineffective in striatum but worsened dyskinesias when given in SN. Quantitative autoradiography showed an increase in N/OFQ receptor binding in striatum and a reduction in SN of both unprimed and dyskinetic 6-hydroxydopamine rats, consistent with opposite adaptive changes of N/OFQ transmission. Finally, the N/OFQ receptor synthetic agonist also reduced dyskinesia expression in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-treated dyskinetic macaques without affecting the global parkinsonian score. We conclude that N/OFQ receptor agonists may represent a novel strategy to counteract L-DOPA-induced dyskinesias. Their action is possibly mediated by upregulated striatal N/OFQ receptors opposing the D1 receptor-mediated overactivation of the striatonigral direct pathway.",nan; LEVODOPA-INDUCED DYSKINESIA; NIGRA PARS RETICULATA; MESSENGER-RNA EXPRESSION; ABNORMAL INVOLUNTARY MOVEMENTS; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; ORPHANIN-FQ; RAT MODEL; ANTAGONIST J-113397

Neuroimaging studies using both galvanic and caloric stimulation have shown that several distinct cortical and subcortical structures can be activated during vestibular information processing. The insular cortex has been often targeted and presented as the central hub of the vestibular cortical system. Since very short pulses of cold water ear irrigation can generate a strong and prolonged vestibular response and a nystagmus, we explored the effects of this type of caloric stimulation for assessing the blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) dynamics of neural vestibular processing in a whole-brain event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiment. We evaluated the spatial layout and the temporal dynamics of the activated cortical and subcortical regions in time-locking with the instant of injection and were able to extract a robust pattern of neural activity involving the contra-lateral insular cortex, the thalamus, the brainstem and the cerebellum. No significant correlation with the temporal envelope of the nystagmus was found. The temporal analysis of the activation profiles highlighted a significantly longer duration of the evoked BOLD activity in the brainstem compared to the insular cortex suggesting a functional de-coupling between cortical and subcortical activity during the vestibular response.

The nexus of auditory activity is located in temporal cortex among several specialized areas, or fields, that receive dense inputs from the medial geniculate complex. These areas are collectively referred to as auditory cortex. Auditory activity is extended beyond auditory cortex via connections with auditory-related areas elsewhere in the cortex. Within this network, information flows between areas to and from countless targets, but in a manner that is characterized by orderly regional, areal and laminar patterns. These patterns reflect some of the structural constraints that passively govern the flow of information at all levels of the network. In addition, the exchange of information within these circuits is dynamically regulated by intrinsic neurochemical properties of projecting neurons and their targets. This article begins with an overview of the principal circuits and how each is related to information flow along major axes of the network. The discussion then turns to a description of neurochemical gradients along these axes, highlighting recent work on glutamate transporters in the thalamocortical projections to auditory cortex. The article concludes with a brief discussion of relevant neurophysiological findings as they relate to structural gradients in the network. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Jakob discussed the connectivity between the cerebellum and mesencephalic, diencephalic, and telencephalic structures in an evolutionary, developmental, and histophysiological perspective. He proposed three evolutionary morphofunctional stages, the archicerebellar, paleocerebellar, and neocerebellar; he attributed the reduced cerebellospinal connections in humans, compared to other primates, to the perfection of the rubrolenticular and thalamocortical systems and the intense ascending pathways to the red nucleus in exchange for the more elementary descending efferent pathways. Jakob hypothesized the convergence of cerebellar pathways in associative cortical regions, insisting on the intimate collaboration of the cerebellum with the frontal lobe. The extensive lines of communication between regions throughout the association cortex substantiate Jakob's intuition and begin to outline the mechanisms for substantial cerebellar involvement in functions beyond the purely motor domain. Atop a foundation of anatomical and phylogenetic mastery, Jakob conceived ideas that were noteworthy, timely, and have much relevance to our current thinking on cerebellar structure and function.",Cerebellar histophysiology; Ontogeny; Phylogeny; History of neuroscience; INTRINSIC FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; RHESUS-MONKEY; HUMAN BRAIN; STRUCTURAL CONNECTIVITY; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; BASAL GANGLIA; MOTOR CORTEX; BASIS PONTIS

These regions, referred to as IPS1-4, show similar functional responses to the mapping tasks used to define them, yet differing responses to tests of other posterior parietal cortex (PPC) functions such as short-term memory, eye movements and object viewing, suggesting that they may have distinct patterns of structural connectivity to other parts of the brain. The present study combined functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) mapping with diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) to describe white matter connections of visuotopic regions along the IPS, in 25 neurotypical young-adult participants. We found that posterior IPS more likely connects to retinotopically defined visual regions, and superior temporal gyrus, relative to anterior IPS. Anterior IPS regions 3 and 4 had higher connection probabilities to prefrontal regions, relative to posterior IPS. All four IPS regions showed inter-hemispheric connections to analogous regions in the opposite hemisphere, as well as consistent connections to the thalamus and regions of the striatum. Multivariate pattern classification at the group level reliably distinguished IPS regions from one another on the basis of connectivity patterns, especially for the most distal pairs of regions; occipital and prefrontal regions provided the most discriminating information. These findings advance our understanding of the structure of visuotopic IPS, with implications for functional differences between regions, and possible homologies between humans and macaques. Visuospatial functions dependent on the parietal cortex are frequently impaired in individuals with developmental disorders and those afflicted by cerebrovascular disease; the findings described here can be used as a basis for comparing connectivity differences in these populations.

Given this limitation, our approach is to construct the maximum noise entropy response function of the system, leading to a closed-form and minimally biased model consistent with a given set of constraints on the input/output moments; the result is equivalent to conditional random field models from machine learning. For systems with binary outputs, such as neurons encoding sensory stimuli, the maximum noise entropy models are logistic functions whose arguments depend on the constraints. A constraint on the average output turns the binary maximum noise entropy models into minimum mutual information models, allowing for the calculation of the information content of the constraints and an information theoretic characterization of the system's computations. We use this approach to analyze the nonlinear input/output functions in macaque retina and thalamus; although these systems have been previously shown to be responsive to two input dimensions, the functional form of the response function in this reduced space had not been unambiguously identified. A second order model based on the logistic function is found to be both necessary and sufficient to accurately describe the neural responses to naturalistic stimuli, accounting for an average of 93% of the mutual information with a small number of parameters. Thus, despite the fact that the stimulus is highly non-Gaussian, the vast majority of the information in the neural responses is related to first and second order correlations.

[I-125]alpha-Btx binds throughout the normal monkey brain, with the greatest density in the thalamic nuclei and with moderate to low binding in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, caudate, putamen, and substantia nigra. Chronic adminstration of low doses of MPTP resulted in animals with stable cognitive deficits without overt parkinsonian motor symptoms. [ 125]a-Btx binding in the brains of these animals was significantly increased in the outermost layers of the supplementary motor cortex (area 6M, similar to50%), primary motor cortex (area 4, similar to112%) and throughout the putamen (similar to50-72%). In contrast, there was no change in [I-125]alpha-btx binding in the brain regions thought to be involved in mediating the cognitive functions impaired in these monkeys (e.g., the hippocampus, areas 9/46D and 46D of the principal sulcus, and area 24c of the cingulate sulcus). Animals with cognitive dysfunction that received escalating doses of MPTP for >6 months developed motor signs of parkinsonism which were indistinguishable from those seen in animals rendered acutely parkinsonian with short term administration of large doses of MPTP. These two motor symptomatic groups had significantly increased [1251] a-btx binding only in the dorsolateral putamen. Immunohistochemical studies showed that the increased [I-125]alpha-btx binding, when observed, was associated with enhanced immunohistochemical staining localized to neurons and was not a result of an astrocytic response to MPTP. These results suggest that the increase in 0 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor expression in the chronic low-dose MPTP treated, motor asymptomatic monkeys may be a part of compensatory processes contributing to the maintained motor functioning in these animals.

Based on evidence that some neurological disorders correspond to linear instabilities, we hypothesize that stability constrains the brain's electrical activity and influences its structure and physiology. Using a physiologically-based model of brain electrical activity, we investigated the stability and dispersion solutions of networks of neuronal populations with propagation time delays and dendritic time constants. We find that stability is determined by the spectrum of the network's matrix of connection strengths and is independent of the temporal damping rate of axonal propagation with stability restricting the spectrum to a region in the complex plane. Time delays and dendritic time constants modify the shape of this region but it always contains the unit disk. Instabilities resulting from changes in connection strength initially have frequencies less than a critical frequency. For physiologically plausible parameter values based on the corticothalamic system, this critical frequency is approximately 10 Hz. For excitatory networks and networks with randomly distributed excitatory and inhibitory connections, time delays and non-zero dendritic time constants have no impact on network stability but do effect dispersion frequencies. Random networks with both excitatory and inhibitory connections can have multiple marginally stable modes at low delta frequencies.",brain networks; stability; network spectra; random matrices; mean-field modeling; LARGE COMPLEX SYSTEM; NEURAL-NETWORKS; ELECTRICAL-ACTIVITY; CONTINUUM MODEL; DYNAMICS; CONNECTIVITY; SYNCHRONIZATION; ORGANIZATION; MACAQUE; DELAYS

Connectivity patterns of these regions may inform on mechanisms of action for DBS of these targets. Methods: Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and probabilistic tractography were performed in 13 nondepressed subjects to determine connectivity patterns of SCCwm and ALIC. Tract maps were generated for each target in each subject, and tract voxels were coded as being unique to either target or shared. Group level tract maps were generated by including only those voxels common to at least 10 of 13 (>75%) subjects. Results: The two targets have distinct patterns of connectivity with regions of overlap. The SCCwm showed consistent ipsilateral connections to the medial frontal cortex, the full extent of the anterior and posterior cingulate, medial temporal lobe, dorsal medial thalamus, hypothalamus, nucleus accumbens, and the dorsal brainstem. The ALIC seed, in contrast, demonstrated widespread projections to frontal pole, medial temporal lobe, cerebellum, nucleus accumbens, thalamus, hypothalamus, and brainstem. Common to both targets, albeit through distinct white matter bundles, were connections to frontal pole, medial temporal lobe, nucleus accumbens, dorsal thalamus, and hypothalamus.

After Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin injections into the PNC, the majority (70%) of anterogradely labeled terminals was localized in the pulvinar proper, the remaining 30% were scattered in the lateral and medial portions of the LP. No PNC neuron retrogradely labeled from the pulvinar was found to also express glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) mRNA, although a large number of neurons carrying the GAD label were found in close vicinity. In contrast, 69% of retrogradely labeled PNC cells also displayed glutamate-like immunoreactivity. Twenty-six out of 96 (27%) visually responsive pulvinar neurons were orthodromically activated by electrical stimulation of the ipsilateral PNC at latencies between 1 and 10 ms (median 1.9 ms). All orthodromically activated neurons responded well to the onset and offset of large visual stimuli and to sudden stimulus shifts. Whenever a saccadic eye movement was executed, these neurons were also activated, except during saccades in darkness. The comparison of saccade-evoked response with responses to visual stimuli that elicit similar retinal image shifts revealed that pretectorecipient pulvinar neurons also seem to receive a saccade-related non-visual input. All response properties correspond to those of a specific class of pulvinar neurons that have been termed SV neurons because they respond to visual stimulation as well as during saccades. They also closely resemble response properties of PNC neurons that project to the ipsilateral pulvinar. The results support the proposal that PNC cells not only directly activate their postsynaptic target neurons in the pulvinar, but that they also provide a visual input to these neurons that greatly contributes to their response characteristics.",extrageniculate visual thalamus; pretectal nuclear complex; saccadic eye movements; visuomotor integration; STRIATE-RECIPIENT ZONE; LATERAL POSTERIOR NUCLEUS; BEHAVING RHESUS-MONKEY; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; VISUAL RESPONSES; TECTO-RECIPIENT; EYE-MOVEMENTS; NEURONS; CELLS

Unlike lesions with a vascular etiology, the lesion of M.B. did not include primary sensory or motor thalamic nuclei. Thus, this patient gave us the exceedingly rare opportunity to study the contribution of the dorsal pulvinar to visuomotor behavior in a human without confounding losses in primary sensory or motor domains. We investigated reaching, saccade and visual decision making performance. Patient data in each task was compared to at least seven age matched healthy controls. While saccades were hypometric towards both hemifields, the patient did not show any spatial choice bias or perceptual deficits. At the same time, he exhibited reach and grasp difficulties, which shared features with both, parietal and cerebellar damage. In particular, he had problems to form a precision grip and exhibited reach deficits expressed in decreased accuracy, delayed initiation and prolonged movement durations. Reach deficits were similar in foveal and extrafoveal viewing conditions and in both visual hemifields but were stronger with the right hand. These results suggest that dorsal pulvinar function in humans goes beyond its subscribed role in visual cognition and is critical for the programming of voluntary actions with the hands.

Correlations between analgesic effect and hemodynamic changes in the brain. A PET study,"To investigate brain mechanisms whereby electrical stimulation of the motor cortex (MCS) may induce pain relief in patients with neuropathic pain, cerebral blood flow (CBF) changes were studied using H2O PET in 19 consecutive patients treated with MCS for refractory neuropathic pain. Patients were studied in three conditions, (a) before MCS (Baseline, stimulator stopped 4 weeks before), (b) during a 35-min period of MCS and (c) during a 75-min period after MCS had been discontinued (OFF). Compared to Baseline, turning on the stimulator was associated with CBF increase in the contralateral (anterior) midcingulate cortex (aMCC, BA24 and 32) and in the dorso-lateral prefrontal (BA10) cortices. The most important changes of CBF were observed in the 75 min after discontinuation of MCS (OFF). This post-stimulation period was associated with CBF increases in a large set of cortical and subcortical regions (from posterior MCC (pMCC) to pregenual (pg) ACC, orbitufrontal cortex, putamen, thalami, posterior cingulate and prefrontal areas) and in the brainstem (mesencephalon/periaqueductal grey (PAG) and pons). CBF changes in the post-stimulation period correlated with pain relief. Functional connectivity analysis showed significant correlation between pgACC and PAG, basal ganglia, and lower pons activities, supporting the activation of descending ACC-to-PAG connections. MCS may act in part through descending (top-down) inhibitory controls that involve prefrontal, orbitofrontal and ACC as well as basal ganglia, thalamus and brainstem. These hemodynamic changes are lengthened and might therefore underlie the long-lasting clinical effects that largely outlast the actual stimulation periods. (c) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

To date, only certain vocal learning species show this behaviour spontaneously. Prior research training macaques (vocal non-learners) to tap to an auditory or visual metronome found their movements to be largely reactive, not predictive. Does this reflect the lack of capacity for predictive synchronization in monkeys, or lack of motivation to exhibit this behaviour? To discriminate these possibilities, we trained monkeys to make synchronized eye movements to a visual metronome. We found that monkeys could generate predictive saccades synchronized to periodic visual stimuli when an immediate reward was given for every predictive movement. This behaviour generalized to novel tempi, and the monkeys could maintain the tempo internally. Furthermore, monkeys could flexibly switch from predictive to reactive saccades when a reward was given for each reactive response. In contrast, when humans were asked to make a sequence of reactive saccades to a visual metronome, they often unintentionally generated predictive movements. These results suggest that even vocal non-learners may have the capacity for predictive and tempo-flexible synchronization to a beat, but that only certain vocal learning species are intrinsically motivated to do it.",nan; PURSUIT EYE-MOVEMENTS; CENTRAL THALAMUS; MUSICAL RHYTHM; INTERVAL; ENTRAINMENT; SACCADES; NEURONS; MACAQUE; TIME; EVOLUTION

Cross-modal modulation can similarly enhance a neuronal representation, and this process can also operate at the primary cortical level. Phase reset of ongoing neuronal oscillatory activity has been shown to be an important element of the underlying modulation of local cortical excitability in both cases. We investigated the influence of attention on oscillatory phase reset in primary auditory and visual cortices of macaques performing an intermodal selective attention task. In addition to responses driven by preferred modality stimuli, we noted that both preferred and nonpreferred modality stimuli could modulate local cortical excitability by phase reset of ongoing oscillatory activity, and that this effect was linked to their being attended. These findings outline a supramodal mechanism by which attention can control neurophysiological context, thus determining the representation of specific sensory content in primary sensory cortex.",nan; THALAMIC RETICULAR NUCLEUS; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL SULCUS; NEURONS IN-VIVO; AUDITORY-CORTEX; MULTISENSORY CONVERGENCE; AUDIOVISUAL INTEGRATION; THETA-OSCILLATIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; DORSAL THALAMUS; NEURAL DYNAMICS

Objective: We report the effects of fluoro-cromolyn derivatives on microglial cell toxicity and microglial clearance of A beta(42). Methods: Microglial cell toxicity for cromolyn derivatives were determined in naive BV2 microglial cells. Microglial clearance assays were performed with A beta(42) in naive BV2 microglial cell line and single cell clone BV2 line expressing CD33WT. PET imaging was performed for three F-18 analogs in a rhesus macaque. Results: All compounds but derivative 8 exhibited lowmicroglial cell toxicity. Cromolyn 1 and derivatives 2, 4, and 7 displayed an increased uptake on A beta(42) in naive BV2 microglial cells. Derivative 4 increased A beta(42) uptake in a dose-dependent manner and at 75 mu M resulted in a one-fold increase in A beta(42) uptake in BV2-CD33(WT). PET imaging for three [F-18]cromolyn analogs revealed the order of brain tracer penetration to be 4a > 10 > 2a. Tracer 4a exhibited enhanced uptake in areas of high perfusion (putamen, grey matter, and cerebellum) and lower signal in areas of lower perfusion (caudate, thalamus, and white matter). Conclusion: Substantial uptake of A beta(42) in both naive BV2 and BV2-CD33WT cells observed with 4 indicate conversion of microglial cells from a pro-inflammatory to an activation state favoring A beta phagocytosis/clearance. These findings suggest that a fluoro-cromolyn analog could reduce fibril-prone A beta 42 in vivo and thereby serve as a therapeutic for the treatment and prevention of AD.",A beta phagocytosis; Alzheimer's disease therapy; amyloid; microglial; PET imaging; AMYLOID-BETA-PEPTIDE; MICROGLIA; ASTHMA; MODEL; CROMOGLYCATE; PHAGOCYTOSIS; INFLAMMATION; SODIUM

A few electrophysiological studies in simian primates have investigated the functional organization of pulvinar by examining visuotopic maps. Multiple visuotopic maps have been found for all studied simians, with differences in organization reported between New and Old World simians. Given that prosimians are considered closer to the common ancestors of New and Old World primates, we investigated the visuotopic organization of pulvinar in the prosimian bush baby (Otolemur garnettii). Single-electrode extracellular recording was used to find the retinotopic maps in the lateral (PL) and inferior (PI) pulvinar. Based on recordings across cases, a 3D model of the map was constructed. From sections stained for Nissl bodies, myelin, acetylcholinesterase, calbindin, or cytochrome oxidase, we identified three PI chemoarchitectonic subdivisions, lateral central (PIcl), medial central (PIcm), and medial (PIm) inferior pulvinar. Two major retinotopic maps were identified that cover PL and PIcl, the dorsal one in dorsal PL and the ventral one in PIcl and ventral PL. Both maps represent central vision at the posterior end of the border between the maps, the upper visual field in the lateral half and the lower visual field in the medial half. They share many features with the maps reported for the pulvinar of simians, including the location in pulvinar and the representation of the upper-lower and central-peripheral visual field axes. The second-order representation in the lateral map and a laminar organization are likely features specific to Old World simians. J. Comp. Neurol. 521:3432-3450, 2013.

The complex in vitro profile of buprenorphine, with affinity for mu-, delta-, and kappa-opioid receptors (OR), makes it difficult to predict its dose-related neuropharmacology in vivo. In rats, microPET imaging and pretreatment by OR antagonists were performed to assess the binding of radiolabeled buprenorphine (microdose C-11-buprenorphine) to OR subtypes in vivo (n = 4 per condition). The mu-selective antagonist naloxonazine (10 mg/kg) and the non-selective OR antagonist naloxone (1 mg/kg) blocked the binding of C-11-buprenorphine, while pretreatment by the delta-selective (naltrindole, 3 mg/kg) or the kappa-selective antagonist (norbinaltorphimine, 10 mg/kg) did not. In four macaques, PET imaging and kinetic modeling enabled description of the regional brain kinetics of C-11-buprenorphine, co-injected with increasing doses of unlabeled buprenorphine. No saturation of the brain penetration of buprenorphine was observed for doses up to 0.11 mg/kg. Regional differences in buprenorphine-associated receptor occupancy were observed. Analgesic doses of buprenorphine (0.003 and 0.006 mg/kg), respectively, occupied 20% and 49% of receptors in the thalamus while saturating the low but significant binding observed in cerebellum and occipital cortex. Occupancy >90% was achieved in most brain regions with plasma concentrations >7 mu g/L. PET data obtained after co-injection of an analgesic dose of buprenorphine (0.003 mg/kg) predicted the binding potential of microdose C-11-buprenorphine. This strategy could be further combined with pharmacodynamic exploration or pharmacological MRI to investigate the neuropharmacokinetics and neuroreceptor correlate, at least at mu-OR, of the acute effects of buprenorphine in humans.",nan; nan

While their connectivity has been studied in primate and in rat, a complete mapping was still missing in the mouse. Here, we analyzed the afferents to the mouse ACC by injecting retrograde tracers in the ventral and dorsal areas of the ACC (areas 24a/b) and of the midcingulate cortex (MCC; areas 24a'/b'). Our results reveal inputs from five principal groups of structures: (1) cortical areas, mainly the orbital, medial prefrontal, retrosplenial, parietal associative, primary and secondary sensory areas and the hippocampus, (2) basal forebrain, mainly the basolateral amygdaloid nucleus, the claustrum and the horizontal limb of the diagonal band of Broca, (3) the thalamus, mainly the anteromedial, lateral mediodorsal, ventromedial, centrolateral, central medial and reuniens/rhomboid nuclei, (4) the hypothalamus, mainly the lateral and retromammillary areas, and (5) the brainstem, mainly the monoaminergic centers. The neurochemical nature of inputs from the diagonal band of Broca and brainstem centers was also investigated by double-labeling, showing that only a part of these afferents were cholinergic or monoaminergic. Comparisons between the areas indicate that areas 24a and 24b receive qualitatively similar inputs, but with different densities. These differences are more pronounced when comparing the inputs to ACC's areas 24a/24b to the inputs to MCC's areas 24a'/24b'. These results provide a complete analysis of the afferents to the mouse areas 24a/24b and 24a'/24b', which shows important similarity with the connectivity of homologous areas in rats, and brings the anatomical basis necessary to address the roles of cingulate areas in mice.",Rodent's cingulate cortex; Prefrontal cortex; Tract-tracing; Connectome; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; CONTEXTUAL FEAR MEMORY; VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA; CONTAINING CELL-BODIES; CONDITIONAL DISCRIMINATION TASK; POSTERIOR THALAMIC NUCLEUS; DEPRESSION-LIKE BEHAVIOR; RHESUS-MONKEY; BASOLATERAL AMYGDALA; MEDIODORSAL THALAMUS

Visual responses were probed with spatially uniform flickering stimuli, so that retinal processing was uninfluenced by eye movements. Nonetheless, saccades had diverse effects, altering not only response strength but also the temporal and chromatic properties of the receptive field. Of these changes, the most prominent was a biphasic modulation of response strength, weak suppression followed by strong enhancement. Saccadic modulation was widespread, and affected both of the major processing streams in the LGN. Our results demonstrate that during natural viewing, thalamic response properties can vary dramatically, even over the course of a single fixation.",nan; RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; UNDERLYING CONTRAST ADAPTATION; RECEPTIVE-FIELD PROPERTIES; TEMPORAL IMPULSE-RESPONSE; NONLAGGED CELLS; RHESUS-MONKEY; AREA MT; CAT; NEURONS; SUPPRESSION

The functional neuroanatomy of such elaborately skilled achievements was characterized in the present study by using O-15-water positron emission tomography to image blindfolded pianists performing a concerto by J.S. Bach. The resulting brain activity was referenced to that for bimanual performance of memorized major scales. Scales and concerto performances both activated primary motor cortex, corresponding somatosensory areas, inferior parietal cortex, supplementary motor area, motor cingulate, bilateral superior and middle temporal cortex, right thalamus, anterior and posterior cerebellum. Regions specifically supporting the concerto performance included superior and middle temporal cortex, planum polare, thalamus, basal ganglia, posterior cerebellum, dorsolateral premotor cortex, right insula, right supplementary motor area, lingual gyrus, and posterior cingulate. Areas specifically implicated in generating and playing scales were posterior cingulate, middle temporal, right middle frontal, and right precuneus cortices, with lesser increases in right hemispheric superior temporal, temporoparietal, fusiform, precuneus, and prefrontal cortices, along with left inferior frontal gyrus. Finally, much greater deactivations were present for playing the concerto than scales. This seems to reflect a deeper attentional focus in which tonically active orienting and evaluative processes, among others, are suspended. This inference is supported by observed deactivations in posterior cingulate, parahippocampus, precuneus, prefrontal, middle temporal, and posterior cerebellar cortices. For each of the foregoing analyses, a distributed set of interacting localized functions is outlined for future test. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The control of voluntary saccades to visual and remembered targets is modeled in terms of interactions between posterior parietal cortex, frontal eye fields, the basal ganglia (caudate and substantia nigra), superior colliculus, mediodorsal thalamus, and the saccade generator of the brainstem. Interactions include the modulation of eye movement motor error maps by topographic inhibitory projections, dynamic remapping of spatial target representations in saccade motor error maps, and sustained neural activity that embodies spatial memory.

Methods: We performed intra-cerebral electrical stimulations in seven patients investigated by depth electrodes for refractory epilepsy and analyzed the presence of evoked potentials (EPs) in all brain regions explored. Bipolar electrical stimulations, consisting of two series of 25 pulses of 1 ms duration, 0.2 Hz frequency, and 3 mA intensity, were delivered in a total of 36 hippocampal stimulations sites. Results: Reproducible EPs were recorded in several brain regions with variable latencies, amplitudes and morphologies. Within the temporal lobe, EPs were present in the amygdala, entorhinal cortex, temporal pole and temporal neocortex. EPs were also observed in the frontal lobe, anterior cingulate gyrus and orbito-frontal cortex, midcingulate and posterior cingulate gyrus, insula and thalamic pulvinar nucleus. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate a large distribution of direct or indirect hippocampal projections. Significance: This widespread connectivity supports the previous definition of different networks involved mainly in memory and behavioral processes, implicating the temporal lobe, the cingulate gyrus or the prefrontal region. Our data provide some clues to further evaluate potential pathways of propagation of mesial temporal lobe seizure, via the insula or the pulvinar nucleus.

The likelihood that glutamate-immunoreactive (GLU-IR) terminals directly innervate STT neurons was investigated. For these studies three lamina IV or V STT cells in the lumbar spinal cords of three monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) were identified electrophysiologically and characterized. Two were identified as high threshold neurons and one as a wide dynamic range neuron. Following intracellular injection of the cells with HRP and reaction to give the cells a Golgi-like appearance, the tissues were processed for electron microscopy. Postembedding immunogold methods with antibodies specific for glutamate were used to identify GLU-IR terminals apposing the somata and dendrites of the STT neurons, including dendrites that extended into laminae IV and III. The GLU-IR terminals were numerous and constituted a mean of 46% of the population counted that appose the STT soma and 50% of the profiles apposing the dendrites. Fifty-four percent of the somatic and 50% of the dendritic surface length was contacted by GLU-IR terminals. Most terminals contained round clear vesicles and some contained a variable number of large dense core vesicles. For one of the three cells examined it was determined that 45% of the terminals apposing the soma were GLU-IR and 30% of the terminals were gamma aminobutyric acid-immunoreactive (GABA-IR). In an additional monkey, a lamina I cell retrogradely labeled from the ventral posterolateral nucleus of the thalamus was found to be ensheathed in glial processes. Of the 9 terminals observed apposing the retrogradely filled STT neuron in one plane of section, 2 were GLU-IR and 3 were GABA-IR. The data suggest that a large percentage of the profiles adjacent to STT neurons in intermediate laminae of the spinal cord contain glutamate and many synapse directly with STT neurons.",EXCITATORY AMINO ACID; GAMMA-AMINOBUTYRIC ACID; SPINAL CORD; PAIN; ULTRASTRUCTURE; COLLOIDAL GOLD; MONKEY; SPINAL DORSAL HORN; EXCITATORY AMINO-ACIDS; PRIMARY AFFERENT; SUBSTANCE-P; REACTION-PRODUCT; NEURONS; RAT; ASPARTATE; CORD; PROJECTIONS

The roles of the basal ganglia in the preparation for and execution of cortically initiated movement are described. Newer roles ascribed to the basal ganglia in sensory-motor gating, cognition, emotion, and motivation are discussed. The old and current concepts of information flow between the cerebral cortex, striatum, pallidum, thalamus, and back to the cerebral cortex are reviewed. The ''funnel'' system of information flow has been discarded in favor of several parallel and largely segregated loops pertaining to motor, oculomotor, cognitive, and limbic functions. The anatomic substrate of each of these loops is described. The specific roles of the striatum, pallidum, substantia nigra, and thalamus in information flow as related to movement are described. The roles of the basal ganglia in reinforcing wanted behavior and suppressing unwanted behavior via direct and indirect striatal loops are discussed. The implications of these loops in the genesis of Parkinson's disease and Huntington's chorea are described.

Methods: Spatially normalized images of FDOPA influx rate constant (Ki) values and relative regional cerebral metabolic rates for glucose (rrCMRglc) were created. Raven's Coloured Progressive Matrices (RCPM) scores and the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor scores were used to determine the patients' cognitive and motor functions, respectively. Multiple correlation analyses between the FDOPA and FDG images and the cognitive and motor scores were performed for each voxel. Results: RCPM score was significantly positively correlated with the FDOPA Ki in the left hippocampus and with the rrCMRglc in the left middle frontal gyrus and right retrosplenial cortex. Motor function was significantly positively correlated with the FDOPA Ki in the bilateral striatum and with the rrCMRglc in association areas and primary visual cortex. The level of motor function was significantly inversely correlated with the FDOPA Ki in the anterior cingulate gyrus and with the rrCMRgle in bilateral primary motor cortex and right putamen. Conclusions: Changes of striatal FDOPA uptake and rrCMRglc in the primary motor cortex likely represent dysfunction in the motor system involving the corticobasal ganglia-thalamocortical loop. Change of FDOPA uptake in the anterior cingulate gyrus may be related to up-regulation of dopamine synthesis in surviving dopamine neurons.

MMN is elicited most commonly in an auditory oddball paradigm in which a sequence of repetitive standard stimuli is interrupted infrequently and unexpectedly by a physically deviant 'oddball' stimulus. Electro- and magnetoencephalographic dipole mapping studies have localized the generators of MMN to supratemporal auditory cortex in the vicinity of Heschl's gyrus, but have not determined the degree to which MMN reflects activation within primary auditory cortex (AI) itself. The present study, using moveable multichannel electrodes inserted acutely into superior temporal plane, demonstrates a significant contribution of AI to scalp-recorded MMN in the monkey, as reflected by greater response of AI to loud or soft clicks presented as deviants than to the same stimuli presented as repetitive standards. The MMN-like activity was localized primarily to supragranular laminae within AI. Thus, standard and deviant stimuli elicited similar degrees of initial, thalamocortical excitation. In contrast, responses within supragranular cortex were significantly larger to deviant stimuli than to standards. No MMN-like activity was detected in a limited number to passes that penetrated anterior and medial to AI. AI plays a well established role in the decoding of the acoustic properties of individual stimuli. The present study demonstrates that primary auditory cortex also plays an important role in processing the relationships between stimuli, and thus participates in cognitive, as well as purely sensory, processing of auditory information.",INTRACORTICAL; MULTICHANNEL RECORDING; AI; PRIMARY AUDITORY CORTEX; COGNITIVE; EVOKED POTENTIAL; AUDITORY; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; RHESUS-MONKEY; PITCH CHANGES; ATTENTION; SCHIZOPHRENIA; RESPONSES; COMPONENT; FIELD

With the increased use of multielectrode recording techniques, synchronous firing of ensembles of neurons has been found at all levels in the mammalian visual pathway, from the retina to the extrastriate cortex. Here we distinguish three categories of synchrony in the visual system, (a) synchrony from anatomical divergence, (b) stimulus-dependent synchrony, and (c) emergent synchrony (oscillations). Although all three categories have been well documented, their functional significance remains uncertain. We discuss several lines of evidence both for and against a role for synchrony in visual processing: the perceptual consequences of synchronous activity, its ability to carry information, and the transmission of synchronous neural events to subsequent stages of processing.",vision; retina; LGN; thalamus; visual cortex; cerebral cortex; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; CROSS-CORRELATION ANALYSIS; CAT STRIATE CORTEX; RECEPTIVE-FIELD PROPERTIES; INTERCOSTAL MOTO-NEURONS; SPIKE TRAINS; SENSORIMOTOR CORTEX; CORTICAL NEURON; MACAQUE MONKEY

When MD is combined with a pharmacological inhibition of the visual cortex, the cortical neurons weaken their response to an open eye and the input axons serving the open eye retract. To determine whether the 2 types of ocular dominance (OD) plasticity reflect an experience-driven modification of neural circuits sharing the same developmental time course, we analyzed the OD plasticity in an inhibited visual cortex using cats at different ages. MD did not affect the OD distribution in the inhibited cortex of adults, confirming that the OD plasticity in the inhibited cortex represents a developmental plasticity. In developing animals, the OD plasticity in the inhibited cortex was observed at the late phase of the critical period (P40-46) but not at the early phase (P22-26). We found a retraction of input axons serving an open eye at the late phase, whereas those at the early phase were comparable to the axons of normal animals. Therefore, the maturation of visual circuits might include an experience-driven rearrangement of thalamocortical projections during the late phase of development.",activity-dependent plasticity; development; ocular dominance; OCULAR DOMINANCE COLUMNS; DEPENDENT PROTEIN-KINASE; MONOCULAR DEPRIVATION; POSTNATAL-DEVELOPMENT; STRIATE CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; CAT; PLASTICITY; EYE; AFFERENTS

For the quantitative analysis of SEPT binding in vivo, two serial PET scans with [C-11](+)McN5652 and [C-11](-)McN5652 were performed in the same animals in a day and the differences in radioactivities of [C-11](+)McN5652 vs. [C-11](-)McN5652 measured from 41-91 min postinjection were calculated as an estimate of specific ligand binding. Higher specific binding of SEPT was observed in the thalamus and striatum, regions known to contain high densities of SERT by in vitro assay, with intermediate levels in the pens, hippocampus, cingulate gyrus, and cortical regions and lower levels in the cerebellum in both young and aged monkeys. Almost all regions assayed except the cerebellum showed significant age-related decreases in the specific binding of SERT, which showed reverse correlation with cortisol level in plasma. When the SEPT blocker fluvoxamine (1 mg/kg) was administered intravenously 30 min after tracer injection, specific binding of SEPT was displaced in both age groups. However, the degree of displacement was more marked in young than in aged monkeys. Cortisol level in plasma was significantly higher in aged than in young animals. These observations demonstrate the usefulness of the combined use of [C-11](+)McN5652 and [C-11](-)McN5652 as an indicator for the age-related changes in cortical SEPT measured noninvasively by PET. In addition, these observations suggest that the age-related impairment of SERT sensitivity for fluvoxamine might be related to the reduced efficacy of antidepressant therapy in elderly patients with depression.

We aimed to determine whether or not the pulvinar signal intensity (SI) on the fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequences at 3.0T MRI differs between AD patients and normal subjects, and also whether the pulvinar SI is correlated with the T2(star) map, an imaging marker for tissue iron, and a cognitive scale. Materials and Methods: Twenty one consecutive patients with AD and 21 age-matched control subjects were prospectively included in this study. The pulvinar SI was assessed on the FLAIR image. We measured the relative SI ratio of the pulvinar to the corpus callosum. The T2(star) values were calculated from the T2(star) relaxometry map. The differences between the two groups were analyzed, by using a Student t test. The correlation between the measurements was assessed by the Pearson's correlation test. Results: As compared to the normal white matter, the FLAIR signal intensity of the pulvinar nucleus was significantly more hypointense in the AD patients than in the control subjects (p < 0.01). The pulvinar T2(star) was shorter in the AD patients than in the control subjects (51.5 +/- 4.95 ms vs. 56.5 +/- 5.49 ms, respectively, p = 0.003). The pulvinar SI ratio was strongly correlated with the pulvinar T2(star) (r = 0.745, p < 0.001). When controlling for age, only the pulvinar-to-CC SI ratio was positively correlated with that of the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score (r = 0.303, p < 0.050). Conversely, the pulvinar T2(star) was not correlated with the MMSE score (r = 0.277, p = 0.080). Conclusion: The FLAIR hypointensity of the pulvinar nucleus represents an abnormal iron accumulation in AD and may be used as an adjunctive finding for evaluating AD.",Alzheimer disease; Magnetic resonance imaging; T2(star) relaxometry; Thalamus; Pulvinar nucleus; Iron; DEEP GRAY-MATTER; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; BETA-AMYLOID PLAQUES; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; TRANSGENIC MICE; BRAIN IRON; SIGNAL INTENSITY; RHESUS-MONKEY; BASAL GANGLIA; 3.0 T

A classic example is perception of a stable visual world in spite of the saccadic eye movements that shift the images on the retina. A long-standing hypothesis is that the brain compensates for the disruption of visual input by using advance knowledge of the impending saccade, an internally generated corollary discharge. One possible neuronal mechanism for this compensation has been previously identified in parietal and frontal cortex of monkeys, but the origin of the necessary corollary discharge remained unknown. Here, we consider recent experiments that identified a pathway for a corollary discharge for saccades that extends from the superior colliculus in the midbrain to the frontal eye fields in the cerebral cortex with a relay in the medial dorsal nucleus of the thalamus. We first review the nature of the evidence used to identify a corollary discharge signal in the complexity of the primate brain and show its use for guiding a rapid sequence of eye movements. We then consider two experiments that show this same corollary signal may provide the input to the frontal cortex neurons that alters their activity with saccades in ways that could compensate for the displacements in the visual input produced by saccadic eye movements. The first experiment shows that the corollary discharge signal is spatially and temporally appropriate to produce the alterations in the frontal-cortex neurons. The second shows that this signal is necessary for this alteration because inactivation of the corollary reduces the compensation by frontal-cortex neurons. The identification of this relatively simple circuit specifies the organization of a corollary discharge in the primate brain for the first time and provides a specific example upon which consideration of the roles of corollary activity in other systems and for other functions can be evaluated.",nan; FRONTAL EYE FIELD; BRAIN-STEM TELLS; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; RHESUS-MONKEY; PARIETAL; CORTEX; THALAMUS; NUCLEUS; NEURONS; PATHWAY

Two of the novel isoforms displayed a deletion in the third intracellular loop (H-3(413) and H-3(410)), the third isoform H-3(335) displayed a deletion in the i3 intracellular loop and a complete deletion of the putative fifth transmembrane domain TM5. We have confirmed by RT-PCR the expression of full-length H-3(445) mRNA as well as H-3(413), H-3(410), and H-3(335) splice isoform mRNA in multiple monkey brain regions including the frontal, parietal and occipital cortex, parahippocampal gyrus, hippocampus, amygdala, caudate nucleus, putamen, thalamus, hypothalamus, and cerebellum. The full-length isoform H-3(445) was predominant in all of the regions tested, followed by H-3(335), with the H-3(413) and H-3(410) being of low abundance. When expressed in C6 cells, H-3(445), H-3(413), and H-3(410) exhibit high affinity binding to the agonist ligand [H-3]-(N)-alpha-methylhistamine with respective pK(D) values of 9.7, 9.7, and 9.6. As expected, the H-3(335) isoform did not display any saturable binding with [H-3]-(N)-alpha-methylhistamine. The histamine H-3 receptor agonists histamine, (R)-alpha-methylhistamine, imetit and proxyfan were able to activate calcium mobilization responses through H-3(445), H-3(413) and H-3(410) receptors when they were co-expressed with the chimeric G alpha(qi5)-protein in HEK293 cells, while no response was elicited in cells expressing the H-3(335) isoform. The existence of multiple H-3 receptor splice isoforms across species raises the possibility that isoform specific properties including ligand affinity, signal transduction coupling, and brain localization may differentially contribute to observed in vivo effects of histamine H-3 receptor antagonists.

Using regional cerebral blood flow and positron emission tomography we previously confirmed frequency-selective cortical responses to 40-Hz tones in auditory primary cortices and concomitant bilateral activation of the cerebellar hemispheres. In this study, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) we estimated the influence of 40-Hz auditory stimulation on the coupling between auditory cortex and superior temporal sulcus (STS) and Crus II, using a dynamic causal model of the interactions between medial geniculate nuclei, auditory superior temporal gyrus (STG)/STS, and the cerebellar Crus II auditory region. Specifically, we tested the hypothesis that 40-Hz-selective responses in the cerebellar Crus II auditory region could be explained by frequency-specific enabling of interactions in the auditory cortico-cerebellar-thalamic loop. Our model comparison results suggest that input from auditory STG/STS to cerebellum is enhanced selectively at gamma-band frequencies around 40 Hz.",nan; STEADY-STATE RESPONSES; MAGNETIC-FIELD; RHESUS-MONKEY; HUMAN BRAIN; ACTIVATION; CORTEX; AREAS; OSCILLATIONS; MODULATION; HUMANS

Multiple injections of small amounts of ibotenic acid were used to produce fiber-sparing lesions of either the anterior (ACC) or the posterior (PCC) cingulate area. Mice with ACC lesions, though learning the initial acquisition and first reversal of the discrimination at about the normal rate, were impaired during the subsequent four reversal sessions. In contrast to control mice, they failed to improve their performance from the first to the last session. Nevertheless, when later required to repeatedly learn the same discrimination over several days (repetitive testing), animals with ACC lesions no longer exhibited any learning deficit. The converse pattern of results was found in mice with PCC lesions. These animals performed much more poorly than control animals during the acquisition and first reversal of the discrimination, but displayed remarkable improvement over the subsequent four reversal sessions, gradually overcoming their initial impairment. However, when later submitted to repetitive testing, these animals again showed a substantial learning deficit. Neither ACC nor PCC cingulate lesions significantly affected the animals' retention capacities as measured by single test-trials over a 24-h interval. Yet, mice with PCC lesions were retarded in reversal learning after a long intersession interval (10 days), indicating that PCC, but not ACC, lesions did interfere with some long-term retention processes. These results imply that the ACC, as a part of the medial frontal cortex, may play a crucial role in temporally ordering a series of spatial responses, whereas the PCC seems to contribute to the formation and retention of each individual spatial response, probably by transmitting information from limbic structures such as the anterior thalamus and hippocampal formation to posterior neocortical association areas.",MEDIAL CORTEX; LIMBIC SYSTEM; NEUROTOXIC LESION; REVERSAL LEARNING; SPATIAL MEMORY; T-MAZE; RODENT; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; IBOTENIC ACID; RHESUS-MONKEY; THALAMIC CONNECTIONS; LIMBIC CORTEX; LESIONS; MEMORY; PROJECTIONS; RAT; GYRUS

Eight TLE patients had mesial temporal, lateral temporal, and thalamic hypometabolism ipsilateral to EEG ictal onsets, with additional extratemporal hypometabolism in four. One had unilateral anterior mesial temporal hypometabolism only, and one had normal metabolism. Each patient had decreased benzodiazepine-receptor binding in the ipsilateral anterior mesial temporal region, without neocortical changes. Thus, interictal metabolic dysfunction is variable and usually extensive in TLE, whereas decreased central benzodiazepine-receptor density is more restricted to mesial temporal areas. Metabolic patterns in TLE may reflect diaschisis, while benzodiazepine-receptor changes may reflect localized neuronal and synaptic loss that is specific to the epileptogenic zone.

In some systems, guiding cues for axonal pathfinding and target selection are provided by specific cells that are present only at critical times. For instance, the floor plate guides commissural axons in the spinal cord, and the subplate is involved in the formation of thalamocortical connections. Here we study the development of entorhinal and commissural connections to the murine hippocampus, which in the adult terminate in nonoverlapping layers. We show that two groups of pioneer neurons, Cajal-Retzius cells and GABAergic neurons, form layer-specific scaffolds that overlap with distinct hippocampal afferents at embryonic and early postnatal stages. Furthermore, at postnatal day 0 (P0)-P5, before the dendrites of pyramidal neurons develop, these pioneer neurons are preferential synaptic targets for hippocampal afferents. Birthdating analysis using 5'-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) pulses showed that most such early-generated neurons disappear at late postnatal stages, most likely by cell death. Together with previous studies, these findings indicate that distinct pioneer neurons are involved in the guidance and targeting of different hippocampal afferents.",Cajal-Retzius cells; pioneer neurons; synapse formation; axonal guidance; anterograde tracers; mouse; POSTNATAL MURINE HIPPOCAMPUS; RECEPTOR TYROSINE KINASES; OCULAR DOMINANCE; SUBPLATE NEURONS; AXON GUIDANCE; RHESUS-MONKEY; MAMMALIAN NEOCORTEX; COLORECTAL-CANCER; CORTICAL-NEURONS; NERVOUS-SYSTEM

As in the human, three subtypes of GnRH neurons were identified. Type I GnRH neurons were small, oval cells with high levels of gene expression and were located within the basal hypothalamus. Type II GnRH neurons were small and sparsely labeled and were widely scattered in the hypothalamus, midline nuclei of the thalamus, and extended amygdala. Type III neurons displayed magnocellular morphology and intermediate labeling intensity and were located in the nucleus basalis of Meynert, caudate, and amygdala. In a second experiment, we determined the effect of estrogen or estrogn plus progesterone on the gene expression of GnRH neurons in the brains of young, ovariectomized cynomolgus monkeys. We report that hormone treatment resulted in a significant decrease in GnRH mRNA in type I neurons within the basal hypothalamus of ovariectomized monkeys. In contrast, there was no effect of hormone treatment on the gene expression of type III GnRH neurons in the nucleus basalis of Meynert. The present findings provide evidence that the increase in gene expression of type I GnRH neurons in postmenopausal women is secondary to the ovarian failure of menopause. The differential responses of type I and III GnRH neurons to hormone treatment provide additional evidence that distinct subpopulations of neurons expressing GnRH mRNA exist in the primate hypothalamus.",nan; RECEPTOR-BETA-IMMUNOREACTIVITY; MEDIAL BASAL HYPOTHALAMUS; FEMALE RHESUS-MONKEY; MACACA-MULATTA; LH-SECRETION; RAT-BRAIN; ESTROGEN; GNRH; FOREBRAIN; FEEDBACK

We evaluated real-time acoustic feedback and aimed to understand whether cavitation contributed to the heating and the lesion formation. In four macaques, we sonicated thalamic targets at acoustic powers of 34-560 W (896-7590 J). Tissue effects evaluated with MRI and histology were compared to MRI-based temperature and thermal dose measurements, acoustic emissions recorded during the experiments, and acoustic and thermal simulations. Peak temperatures ranged from 46 to 57 degrees C, and lesions were produced in 5/8 sonicated targets. A linear relationship was observed between the applied acoustic energy and both the focal and brain surface heating. Thermal dose thresholds were 15-50 cumulative equivalent minutes at 43 degrees C, similar to prior studies at higher frequencies. Histology was also consistent with earlier studies of thermal effects in the brain. The system successfully controlled the power level and maintained a low level of cavitation activity. Increased acoustic emissions observed in 3/4 animals occurred when the focal temperature rise exceeded approximately 16 degrees C. Thresholds for thermally-significant subharmonic and wideband emissions were 129 and 140 W, respectively, corresponding to estimated pressure amplitudes of 2.1 and 2.2 MPa. Simulated focal heating was consistent with the measurements for sonications without thermally-significant acoustic emissions; otherwise it was consistently lower than the measurements. Overall, these results suggest that the lesions were produced by thermal mechanisms. The detected acoustic emissions, however, and their association with heating suggest that cavitation might have contributed to the focal heating. Compared to earlier work with a 670 kHz TcMRgFUS system, the brain surface heating was substantially reduced and the focal heating was higher with this 230 kHz system, suggesting that a reduced frequency can increase the treatment envelope for TcMRgFUS and potentially reduce the risk of skull heating.",focused ultrasound; brain; thermal ablation; MRI; acoustic simulation; OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER; BLOOD-BRAIN-BARRIER; PROOF-OF-CONCEPT; HUMAN SKULL; IN-VIVO; ESSENTIAL TREMOR; FUNCTIONAL NEUROSURGERY; ACOUSTIC CAVITATION; RABBIT BRAIN; PHASED-ARRAY

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at 3 tesla (T), collective responses of neural populations in the LGN were measured as a function of stimulus contrast and flicker reversal rate and compared with those obtained in visual cortex. Flickering checkerboard stimuli presented in alternation to the right and left hemifields reliably activated the LGN. The peak of the LGN activation was found to be on average within +/-2 mm of the anatomical location of the LGN, as identified on high-resolution structural images. In all visual areas except the middle temporal (MT), fMRI responses increased monotonically with stimulus contrast. In the LGN, the dynamic response range of the contrast function was larger and contrast gain was lower than in the cortex. Contrast sensitivity was lowest in the LGN and V1 and increased gradually in extrastriate cortex. In area MT, responses were saturated at 4% contrast. Response modulation by changes in flicker rate was similar in the LGN and V1 and occurred mainly in the frequency range between 0.5 and 7.5 Hz; in contrast, in extrastriate areas V4, V3A, and MT, responses were modulated mainly in the frequency range between 7.5 and 20 Hz. In the human pulvinar, no activations were obtained with the experimental designs used to probe response properties of the LGN. However, regions in the mediodorsal right and left pulvinar were found to be consistently activated by bilaterally presented flickering checkerboard stimuli, when subjects attended to the stimuli.

At the first level, there are three primary-like areas, each with a discrete pattern of tonotopic organization, koniocortical histological features, and direct inputs from the ventral division of the medial geniculate complex, These three core areas are interconnected and project to a narrow surrounding belt of perhaps seven areas which receive thalamic input from the major divisions of the medial geniculate complex, the suprageniculate/limitans complex, and the medial pulvinar, The belt areas connect with a lateral parabelt region of two or more fields that are almost devoid of direct connections with the core and the ventral division of the medial geniculate complex, The parabelt fields connect with more distant cortex in the superior temporal gyrus, superior temporal sulcus, and prefrontal cortex, The results indicate that auditory processing involves 15 or more cortical areas, each of which is interconnected with a number of other fields, especially adjoining fields of the same level.",medial geniculate; core; belt; parabelt; prefrontal; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL REGION; BINDING PROTEIN IMMUNOREACTIVITY; GRANULAR FRONTAL-CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; ASSOCIATION CORTEX; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; AFFERENT INPUT; MACAQUE MONKEY; TUPAIA-GLIS

To understand these differences on the level of single neurons we compared neuronal firing in the primary and posterior auditory cortex of the two hemispheres and in the medial geniculate body in monkeys while subjects categorized pitch relationships in tone sequences. In contrast to earlier findings in imaging studies performed on humans, we found little difference between the three brain regions in terms of the category-specificity of their neuronal responses, of tonic firing related to task components, and of decision-related firing.

The fiber connectivity of RSC had been reported in rodent and primate studies by tracer injection methods To explore structural and functional connectivity of two sub-regions of RSC, Brodmann area (BA)29 and BA30, we constructed fiber connectivity networks of two sub-regions by diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography based on diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional connectivity networks by resting-state functional MRI. The BA29 network showed fiber connections with auditory cortex and functional connections with BA21. Both fiber and functional connections show that BA30 network includes visual cortex. Furthermore, BA30 had fiber connections with hippocampus, thalamus, and prefrontal cortex. We suggest that (1) structural connectivity reflects functional connectivity in some degree.

To study optic radiations connectivity by means of advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) approaches, noninvasively, in vivo, in healthy human brains. METHODS. Sixteen healthy subjects (nine males, age range, 25-40 years) were included in this study. Morphologic and diffusion data were acquired by means of a 3T MRI scanner. Using an advanced tractographic technique, based on probabilistic constrained spherical deconvolution algorithm, postprocessing analyses were performed. Statistical analysis was carried out using the 2-tailed Wilcoxon rank sum test. Outcome measure was the percentage distribution of optic radiations streamlines in different cortical visual areas (V1-V5). The latter were detected by means of Juelich probabilistic histologic atlas. RESULTS. Average connectivity analyses revealed that the optic radiations are mainly distributed in V1 (47.46% +/- 5.5) and V2 (32.45% +/- 3.98); furthermore, direct connections with V3 (7.81 +/- 3.06), V4 (4.22% +/- 1.82), and V5 (8.06% +/- 2.65) were also detected. CONCLUSIONS. In the present study, the connectivity profile of optic radiations, obtained by means of algorithms not affected by the limitations of other tractographic techniques, such as diffusion tensor imaging, was shown in healthy human brains. Interestingly, direct connections with V4 were detected for the first time in humans; moreover, further support on the possible existence of V5 connections was provided. Our findings showed new connections between lateral geniculate nuclei and cortical visual areas, giving a further possible comprehension of the phenomena leading to the visual signals elaboration.",optic radiations; tractography; visual cortex; thalamus/lateral geniculate nucleus; connectivity; CONSTRAINED SPHERICAL DECONVOLUTION; AREA V4; SUBCORTICAL CONNECTIONS; DIFFUSION MRI; TRACTOGRAPHY; V1; MACAQUE; CALBINDIN; NETWORK; FIBERS

One mechanism through which the observed close relation between cortical architecture and connectivity may be established is the joint development of cortical areas and their connections in developmental time windows. Here, we describe a theoretical exploration of the possible mechanistic underpinnings of the architectonic type principle, by performing systematic computational simulations of cortical development. The main component of our in silico model was a developing two-dimensional cortical sheet, which was gradually populated by neurons that formed cortico-cortical connections. To assess different explanatory mechanisms, we varied the spatiotemporal trajectory of the simulated neurogenesis. By keeping the rules governing axon outgrowth and connection formation constant across all variants of simulated development, we were able to create model variants which differed exclusively by the specifics of when and where neurons were generated. Thus, all differences in the resulting connectivity were due to the variations in spatiotemporal growth trajectories. Our results demonstrated that a prescribed targeting of interareal connection sites was not necessary for obtaining a realistic replication of the experimentally observed relation between connection patterns and architectonic differentiation. Instead, we found that spatiotemporal interactions within the forming cortical sheet were sufficient if a small number of empirically well-grounded assumptions were met, namely planar, expansive growth of the cortical sheet around two points of origin as neurogenesis progressed, stronger architectonic differentiation of cortical areas for later neurogenetic time windows, and stochastic connection formation. Thus, our study highlights a potential mechanism of how relative architectonic differentiation and cortical connectivity become linked during development. We successfully predicted connectivity in two species, cat and macaque, from simulated cortico-cortical connection networks, which further underscored the general applicability of mechanisms through which the architectonic type principle can explain cortical connectivity in terms of the relative architectonic differentiation of cortical regions.",nan; RICH-CLUB ORGANIZATION; POSTNATAL-DEVELOPMENT; THALAMOCORTICAL PROJECTIONS; FEEDBACK-CIRCUITS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; VISUAL-CORTEX; TIME WINDOWS; BRAIN; MOUSE

This antibody preferentially stains LGN cells that display the morphological characteristics of Y-cells. The soma sizes of SMI-32-stained cells were consistent with those of the overall population of Y-cells, and the Golgi-like staining of their dendrites revealed a radial distribution that often crossed laminar boundaries. Labeled cells were distributed within the A laminae (primarily near laminar borders), the magnocellular portion of the C laminae, and the medial intralaminar nucleus, but they were absent in the parvocellular C laminae. Electron microscopic examination of SMl-32-stained tissue revealed that staining was confined to somata, dendrites, and large myelinated axons. Retinal synapses on SMI-32-labeled dendrites were primarily simple axodendritic contacts; few triadic arrangements were observed. In the LGN of cats reared with monocular lid suture, SMI-32, staining was decreased significantly in the A laminae that received input from the deprived eye. Dephosphorylation of the tissue did not alter the cellular SMI-32 staining patterns. Analysis of staining patterns in the G laminae and monocular zone of the A laminae suggests that changes in the cytoskeleton after lid suture reflect cell class and not binocular competition. Taken together, the results from normal and lid-sutured animals suggest that the cat LGN offers a unique model system in which the cytoskeleton of one class of cells can be manipulated by altering neuronal activity.",SMI-32; electron microscopy; monocular deprivation; immunocytochemistry; thalamus; cytoskeleton; INFERIOR TEMPORAL CORTEX; INDIVIDUAL X-CELL; MONOCULAR DEPRIVATION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; QUANTITATIVE-ANALYSIS; PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; MACAQUE MONKEY; RETINOGENICULATE TERMINATIONS; VULNERABLE SUBSET; DEPRIVED CATS

The aim of this study was to demonstrate brain-activity patterns related to a word-pair association task employing a whole-brain EPI sequence. Six right-handed, healthy male volunteers (mean age: 27.5 years) took part in the study. fMRI was performed at a field strength of 1.5 Tesla with 26-32 slices parallel to the AC-PC line, depending on individual brain size. Distributed brain regions were activated in episodic encoding and retrieval with similarities, but also (distinct) differences in activation patterns. Bilateral prefrontal cortical areas were involved when comparing encoding as well as retrieval to the reference condition (nonsense words). Furthermore, activation was observed in cerebellar areas during encoding, and activation in bilateral parietal areas (precuneus and inferior parietal cortex) was differentially more pronounced during retrieval. The activation of left dorsomedial thalamus during retrieval of high imagery-content word-pair associates may point to the role of this structure in episodic retrieval. The direct cognitive subtraction of encoding minus retrieval yielded a differentially larger left prefrontal activation. There was a differentially higher right prefrontal activation during retrieval than during encoding, underlining the proposed right/left asymmetry for episodic memory processes.",episodic memory; paired word association; fMRI; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; MEDIAL PULVINAR NUCLEUS; WORKING-MEMORY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; FRONTAL-LOBE; THALAMIC INFARCTION; VERBAL MEMORY; VISUAL-CORTEX

Understanding how these brain networks work together is fundamental for appreciating network-wise changes reported in patients with chronic pain disorders. Parcellating pain related networks and understanding their causal relationships is the first step to understand how painful information is processed, integrated, and modulated, and it requires direct manipulation of specific brain regions. Nonhuman primates (NHP) offer an ideal model system to achieve these goals because cortical and subcortical regions in the NHP brain are established based on a variety of different types of data collected in a way that is not feasible or, at least, extremely difficult in humans (i.e., histology data, tract-tracing, intracerebral recordings). In addition, different methodological techniques can also help characterize and further understand these brain cortical and subcortical regions over the course of development. Here we used a heat nociceptive stimulation that is proven to elicit activity of nociceptive neurons in the cortex to refine and parcellate the whole brain nociceptive functional networks, to identify key network hubs, and to characterize network-wise temporal dynamic signatures using high-resolution fMRI. We first functionally localized 24 cortical and subcortical regions that responded to heat nociceptive stimuli (somatosensory area 1/2, area 3a/3b, S2, posterior insula (pIns), anterior insula, area 7b, posterior parietal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), prefrontal cortex, caudate, and mediodorsal (MD) and ventral posterior lateral (VPL) thalamic nuclei) and used them as seeds in resting state fMRI (rsfMRI) data analysis. We applied both hierarchical clustering and graph-theory analyses of the pairwise rsfMRI correlation metrics and identified five cortical and one subcortical sub-networks: strong resting state functional connectivity (rsFC) between ACC and prefrontal regions, parietal cortex and area 7b, S2 and posterior insula, areas 3a/3b and 1/2 within the S1 cortex, and thalamic MD and caudate nuclei. The rsFC strengths between cortical areas within each subnetwork were significantly stronger than those between subcortical regions. Regions within each sub-network also exhibited highly correlated temporal dynamics at rest, but the overall dynamic patterns varied drastically across sub-networks. Graph-theory analysis identified the MD nucleus as a hub that connects subcortical and cortical nociceptive sub-networks.

The regions are the cortical site of attentional expression, the thalamic enhancement structure, and the prefrontal area of control. It is also proposed that awareness of an object requires the additional component of attention directed to a representation of the self. The expression of attention to a self-representation may involve activations of cortical sites corresponding to the body landscape and/or verbal-based memories of autobiographical episodes. As in the case of attention to objects, attention to the self is presumed to involve a triangular circuit. The proposed triangular circuit of attention is shown to be generally consistent with current knowledge of brain structures and with data from a broad range of experiments concerned with the functions of neurons in these structures.

These regions are old in phylogeny and have widespread connections with eulaminate neocortices, intricately linking areas associated with emotion and cognition. The ACC and pOFC have distinct cortical and subcortical connections and are also interlinked, but the pattern of their connections-which may be used to infer the flow of information between them-is not well understood. Here we found that pathways from ACC area 32 innervated all pOFC areas with a significant proportion of large and efficient terminals, seen at the level of the system and the synapse. The pathway from area 32 targeted overwhelmingly elements of excitatory neurons in pOFC, with few postsynaptic sites found on presumed inhibitory neurons. Moreover, pathways from area 32 originated mostly in the upper layers and innervated preferentially the middle-deep layers of the least differentiated pOFC areas, in a pattern reminiscent of feedforward communication. Pathway terminations from area 32 overlapped in the deep layers of pOFC with output pathways that project to the thalamus and the amygdala, and may have cascading downstream effects on emotional and cognitive processes and their disruption in psychiatric disorders.",cerebral cortex; connection patterns; laminar architecture; primate brain; structural model; PREFRONTAL CORTICAL PROJECTIONS; OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER; THALAMIC RETICULAR NUCLEUS; DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; WHEAT-GERM-AGGLUTININ; RHESUS-MONKEY; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; INHIBITORY SYSTEMS; TEMPORAL PATHWAYS; CORTICOCORTICAL CONNECTIONS

These are: extrinsic outputs, excitatory and inhibitory intrinsic connectivity, and intrinsic inputs. Supporting data are biased from the visual system of nonhuman primates (NHPs), but I have drawn as much as possible from a broader span in order to treat the important issue of area-specific variability. In a second part, I briefly discuss laminar connectivity in the context of network organization (feedforward/feedback cortical connections, and the major types of corticothalamic connections). I also point out anatomical issues in need of clarification, including more systematic, whole brain coverage of tracer injections; more data on anterogradely labeled terminations; more complete, area-specific quantitative data about projection neurons, and quantitative data on terminal density and convergence. Postsynaptic targets are largely unknown, but their identification is essential for understanding the finer analysis and principles of laminar patterns. Laminar resolution MRI offers a promising new tool for exploring laminar connectivity: it is potentially fast and macro-scale, and allows for repeated investigation under different stimulus conditions.

This view not only afforded the mammillary bodies no independent role in memory, it also neglected the potential significance of other, nonhippocampal, inputs to the mammillary bodies. Recent advances have transformed the picture, revealing that projections from the tegmental nuclei of Gudden, and not the hippocampal formation, are critical for sustaining mammillary body function.

Previous neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that testosterone increases neural activity in the amygdala. To investigate whether this could be due to altered regulation of amygdala functioning which is thought to be mediated by the prefrontal cortex, we studied the effects of exogenous testosterone on the interaction between the amygdala and other brain regions. Healthy middle-aged women received a single nasal testosterone dose in a randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover manner, and performed an emotional face matching task while their brain activity was measured with functional MRI. The results show that testosterone rapidly reduced functional coupling of the amygdala with the orbitofrontal cortex, and enhanced amygdala coupling with the thalamus. This suggests that testosterone may reduce the regulatory control over the amygdala, or that testosterone shifts amygdala output away from the orbitofrontal cortex towards the thalamus. Testosterone also reduced functional coupling with the contralateral amygdala. Because interhemispheric amygdala coupling is lower in men than in women, this result suggests that circulating testosterone may contribute to this sexual dimorphism. (c) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

To reveal the anatomical substrate for these multimodal responses, we examined the connections of the primary auditory area + the anterior auditory field (A1 + AAF), the temporal anterior area (TA), and the primary visual area (V1). A1 + AAF had intrinsic connections and connections with TA, multimodal cortex (MM), V1, and primary somatosensory area (S1). TA had intrinsic connections and connections with A1 + AAF, MM, and V2. Callosal connections were observed in homotopic locations in auditory cortex for both fields. A1 + AAF and TA receive thalamic input primarily from divisions of the medial geniculate nucleus but also from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGd), the lateral posterior nucleus, and the ventral posterior nucleus (VP). V1 had dense intrinsic connections and connections with V2, MM, auditory cortex, pyriform cortex (Pyr), and, in some cases, somatosensory cortex. V1 had interhemispheric connections with V1, V2, MM, S1, and Pyr and received thalamic input from LGd and VP.

In the present study, we investigated the influence of the pulvinar nucleus upon response properties of single cells in the second visual area (V2) of Cebus monkeys. The method used consisted of the inactivation of a portion of the lateral pulvinar by GABA injections while studying the response properties of cells in V2 at the same visuotopic location as that of the inactivation. 2. After GABA injection in the pulvinar, most cells in V2 (67%) showed changes in spontaneous and/or stimulus-driven activities. Contrary to the effect found with inactivation of the striate cortex, which promotes a reduction in the response of V2 neurons, we found that the main effect of pulvinar inactivation was an increment in stimulus-driven responses of V2 cells (39% of units studied). A reduction of responses was observed in 27% of units. 3. A change in orientation and/or direction selectivity was found in 91% of cells after inactivation of the pulvinar. Most commonly, the orientation selectivity of a neuron was decreased during pulvinar inactivation. 4.

A parametric analysis was applied to determine the effects of each of both factors as well as their interaction. Subjects performed four different cyclical movement tasks of increasing spatiotemporal complexity (i.e., unimanual left-right hand movements, bimanual in-phase movements, bimanual anti-phase movements, and bimanual 90degrees out-of-phase movements) across four frequency levels (0.9, 1.2, 1.5, and 1.8 Hz). Results showed that, within the network involved in bimanual coordination, functional subcircuits could be distinguished: Activation in the supplementary motor area, superior parietal cortex (SPS), and thalamic VPL Nc was mainly correlated with increasing spatiotemporal complexity of the limb movements, suggesting that these areas are involved in higher-order movement control. By contrast, activation within the primary motor cortex, cingulate motor cortex (CMC), globus pallidus, and thalamic VLo Ne correlated mainly with movement frequency, indicating that these areas play an important role during movement execution. Interestingly, the cerebellum and the dorsal premotor cortex were identified as the principal regions responding to manipulation of both parameters and exhibiting clear interaction effects. Therefore, it is concluded that both areas represent critical sites for the control of bimanual coordination. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Rodent pulvinar, more commonly called the lateral posterior nucleus (LP), consists of three highly-conserved subdivisions, and offers the advantage of simplicity in its study compared to more subdivided primate pulvinar. Little is known about receptive field properties of LP, let alone whether functional differences exist between different LP subdivisions, making it difficult to understand what visual information is relayed and what kinds of computations the pulvinar might support. Here, we characterized single-cell response properties in two V1 recipient subdivisions of rat pulvinar, the rostromedial (LPrm) and lateral (LPl), and found that a fourth of the cells were selective for orientation, compared to half in V1, and that LP tuning widths were significantly broader. Response latencies were also significantly longer and preferred size more than three times larger on average than in V1; the latter suggesting pulvinar as a source of spatial context to V1. Between subdivisons, LPl cells preferred higher temporal frequencies, whereas LPrm showed a greater degree of direction selectivity and pattern motion detection. Taken together with known differences in connectivity patterns, these results suggest two separate visual feature processing channels in the pulvinar, one in LPl related to higher speed processing which likely derives from superior colliculus input, and the other in LPrm for motion processing derived through input from visual cortex. Significance Statement: The pulvinar has a perplexing role in visual cognition as no clear link has been found between the functional properties of its neurons and behavioral deficits that arise when it is damaged. The pulvinar, called the lateral posterior nucleus (LP) in rats, is a higher order thalamic relay with input from the superior colliculus and visual cortex and output to all of visual cortex. By characterizing single-cell response properties in anatomically distinct subdivisions we found two separate visual feature processing channels in the pulvinar, one in lateral LP related to higher speed processing which likely derives from superior colliculus input, and the other in rostromedial LP for motion processing derived through input from visual cortex.

Res., 7 (1985) 2-10) is examined in this review. In these ten years, connections have been described between the insula and the orbital cortex, frontal operculum, lateral premotor cortex, ventral granular cortex, and medial area 6 in the frontal lobe. Insular connections between the second somatosensory area and retroinsular area of the parietal lobe have been documented. The insula was found to connect with the temporal pole and the superior temporal sulcus of the temporal lobe. It has an abundance of local intrainsular connections and projections to subdivisions of the cingulate gyrus. The insula has connections with the lateral, lateral basal, central, cortical and medial amygdaloid nuclei. It also connects with nonamygdaloid areas such as the perirhinal cortex, entorhinal, and periamygdaloid cortex. The thalamic taste area, the parvicellular part of the ventral posteromedial nucleus, projects fibers to the ipsilateral insular-opercular cortex. In the past decade, confirmation has been given to the insula as a visceral sensory area, visceral motor area, motor association area, vestibular area, and language area. Recent studies have expanded the role of the insula as a somatosensory area, emphasizing its multifaceted, sensory role. The idea of the insula as limbic integration cortex has been affirmed and its role in Alzheimer's disease suggested.",insula; insular lobe; insular cortex; cerebral cortex; primate; human; POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; MONKEYS MACACA-FASCICULARIS; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL SULCUS; OLD-WORLD MONKEY; RHESUS-MONKEY; CORTICAL AFFERENTS; VESTIBULAR CORTEX; CINGULATE CORTEX; CORTICOCORTICAL CONNECTIONS

This study examined the physiological characteristics of incertal neurons and their relationship to saccades. Cells in the zona incerta have moderate rates of activity and pause during saccades. These pauses begin prior to the start of saccades and activity resumes after the end of saccades in all directions and for all amplitudes. This perisaccadic pause is positively correlated with the duration of the saccade such that the longer the saccade is, the longer a pause is observed.

In the present study, we investigated how ongoing and visually driven activity in magnocellular (M), parvocellular (P) and koniocellular (K) layers of the LGN are related to cortical state. We recorded extracellular spiking activity in the LGN simultaneously with local field potentials (LFP) in primary visual cortex, in sufentanil-anaesthetized marmoset monkeys. We found that asynchronous cortical states (marked by low power in delta-band LFPs) are linked to high spike rates in K cells (but not P cells or M cells), on multisecond timescales. Cortical asynchrony precedes the increases in K cell spike rates by 1-3s, implying causality. At subsecond timescales, the spiking activity in many cells of all (M, P and K) classes is phase-locked to delta waves in the cortical LFP, and more cells are phase-locked during synchronous cortical states than during asynchronous cortical states. The switch from low-to-high spike rates in K cells does not degrade their visual signalling capacity. By contrast, during asynchronous cortical states, the fidelity of visual signals transmitted by K cells is improved, probably because K cell responses become less rectified. Overall, the data show that slow fluctuations in cortical state are selectively linked to K pathway spiking activity, whereas delta-frequency cortical oscillations entrain spiking activity throughout the entire LGN, in anaesthetized marmosets.",cerebral cortex; lateral geniculate nucleus; oscillation; thalamus; visual pathways; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; MACAQUE STRIATE CORTEX; KONIOCELLULAR BLUE-ON; S CONE SIGNALS; RELAY CELLS; CALLITHRIX-JACCHUS; GENICULOCORTICAL RELAY; SPATIAL PROPERTIES; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; GANGLION-CELLS

We applied meta-analytic connectivity modeling in order to examine which brain regions are most frequently coactivated with the medial and lateral portions of the OFC in published functional neuroimaging studies. The analysis revealed a clear divergence in the pattern of connectivity for the medial OFC (mOFC) and lateral OFC (lOFC) regions. The lOFC showed coactivations with a network of prefrontal regions and areas involved in cognitive functions including language and memory. In contrast, the mOFC showed connectivity with default mode, autonomic, and limbic regions. Convergent patterns of coactivations were observed in the amygdala, hippocampus, striatum, and thalamus. A small number of regions showed connectivity specific to the anterior or posterior sectors of the OFC. Task domains involving memory, semantic processing, face processing, and reward were additionally analyzed in order to identify the different patterns of OFC functional connectivity associated with specific cognitive and affective processes.

Multiple subdivisions revealed through acetylcholinesterase and Cat-301 chemoarchitecture,"Tree shrews are highly visual mammals closely related to primates. They have a large visual pulvinar complex, but its organization and relation to visual cortex is only partly known. We processed brain sections through the pulvinar with seven different procedures in an effort to reveal histologically distinct compartments. The results revealed three major subdivisions. A dorsal subdivision, Pc, stains darkly for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and occupies the dorsoposterior one-third of the pulvinar complex. A ventral subdivision, Pv, stains darkly when processed with the Cat-301 antibody and occupies the ventroanterior fifth of the pulvinar complex along the brachium of the superior colliculus. Unexpectedly, part of Pv is ventral to the brachium. A large central subdivision, Pc, stains moderately dark for AChE and cytochrome oxidase (CO), and very light for Cat-301. Pc includes about half of the pulvinar complex, with parts on both sides of the brachium of the superior colliculus. These architectonic results demonstrate that the pulvinar complex of tree shrews is larger and has more subdivisions than previously described. The complex resembles the pulvinar of primates by having a portion ventral to the brachium and by having histochemically distinct nuclei; the number of nuclei is less than in primates, however.

Results: The outflow facility and the area under the curve (outflow) increased with the increasing number of thalamosinusotomy incisions (0 to 4). Thalamosinusotomy eyes showed more stained tissue (conjunctiva, outer sclera, inner sclera) than sham surgery eyes with significant statistical difference (P<0.05).

Here, we describe the distribution of retinal afferents to the dLGN of Tarsius, the single contemporary member of an ancient lineage of primates. In this genus, the more superficial layer of the dLGN receives projections from the ipsilateral eye, a unique situation among the members of the Order Primates.

However, whether this incertal connection represents a general mammalian pattern remains to be determined. We used neuronal tracers to examine the zona incerta connections with the midbrain tectum in the gray squirrel and macaque monkey. Collicular injections in both species revealed that most incertotectal neurons lay in the ventral layer, but anterogradely labeled tectoincertal terminals were found in both the dorsal and ventral layers. In the monkey, injections of the pretectum also produced retrograde labeling, but mainly in the dorsal layer. The dendritic fields of incertotectal and incertopretectal cells were generally contained within the layer inhabited by their somata. The macaque, but not the squirrel, zona incerta extended dorsolaterally, within the external medullary lamina. Zona incerta injections produced retrogradely labeled neurons in the superior colliculus of both species. In the squirrel, most cells inhabited the lower sublamina of the intermediate gray layer, but in the monkey, they were scattered throughout the deeper layers. Labeled cells were present among the pretectal nuclei in both species. Labeled terminals were concentrated in the lower sublamina of the intermediate gray layer of both species, but were dispersed among the pretectal nuclei. In summary, an incertal projection that is concentrated on the collicular motor output layers and that originates in the ventral layer of the ipsilateral zona incerta is a common mammalian feature, suggesting an important role in collicular function.",Gaze; Eye movements; GABA; Primate; Pretectum; Inhibition; MESENCEPHALIC RETICULAR-FORMATION; ANTERIOR PRETECTAL NUCLEUS; NIGRA PARS RETICULATA; SACCADIC EYE-MOVEMENTS; AMINOBUTYRIC-ACID GABA; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; THALAMIC NUCLEI; BASAL GANGLIA; OPTIC TRACT

All of these prefrontal areas were found to be targets of basal-ganglia output that originated in the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi) and/or the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra (SNpr). Approximately one-third of the total volume of these nuclei was directed toward prefrontal cortex, a volume comparable to that directed at the cortical motor areas. The origins of the outputs to different prefrontal areas were topographically organized. Different portions of SNpr (the rostral and caudal thirds) projected to areas 9m and 12l. Similarly, different output nuclei (GPi and SNpr) projected to adjacent portions of the same cytoarchitectonic field (46d and 46v). Furthermore, the outputs to prefrontal areas were segregated from those to motor areas of cortex. Thus, basal-ganglia outputs to prefrontal cortex are both extensive and topographically organized, forming a rich anatomical substrate for basal-ganglia influences on the cognitive operations of the frontal lobe.",nan; HERPES-SIMPLEX-VIRUS; FRONTAL EYE FIELD; MONKEY SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; PARS RETICULATA NEURONS; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; HUNTINGTONS-DISEASE; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; RHESUS-MONKEY; TRANSNEURONAL TRANSPORT

Based on data from behavioral and neuroimaging studies, it has been proposed that the reversal is due to a conflict between anatomical and spatial representations of the tactile signal or to the production of an inverted apparent motion signal. Because the alpha rhythms, which consist of a few distinct components, reportedly modulate tactile perception and apparent motion and serve as a 10 Hztimer, we hypothesized that the illusory reversal would be regulated by some of the alpha rhythms. To test this hypothesis, we conducted magnetoencephalographic recordings in both male and female participants during the tactile temporal order judgment task. We decomposed the alpha rhythms into five independent components and discovered that the illusory reversal was modulated by the phase of one independent component with strong current sources near the parieto-occipital (PO) sulcus (peri-PO component). As expected, the estimated current sources distributed over the human MST implicated to represent tactile apparent motion, in addition to the intraparietal region implicated in mapping tactile signals in space. However, the strongest source was located in the precuneus that occupies a central hub region in the cortical networks and receives tactile inputs through a tecto-thalamic pathway. These results suggest that the peri-PO component plays an essential role in regulating tactile temporal perception by modulating the thalamic nuclei that interconnect the superior colliculus with the cortical networks.",alpha rhythm; arm crossing; independent component analysis; MEG; mu rhythm; temporal order judgment; INDEPENDENT COMPONENT ANALYSIS; MACAQUE MONKEY; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; VISUAL-PERCEPTION; REFERENCE FRAMES; AREA V6A; ATTENTION; CORTEX; INTEGRATION; DISCRIMINATION

We Sought to ascertain how regions postulated to be abnormal in bipolar and unipolar disorders were functionally connected to the rest of the brain, and how this associativity differed from healthy controls. Thirty patients with bipolar disorder (Bps), 34 patients with Unipolar disorder (Ups), and 66 healthy volunteers (Willis, M.W., Benson, B. E., Ketter, T.A., Kimbrell, T.A., George, M.S., Speer, A.M., Herscovitch, P., Post, R.M., 2008. Interregional cerebral metabolic associativity during a continuous performance task in healthy adults. Psychiatry Research: Neuroimaging 164 (1)) were imaged using F-18-fluorodeoxyglucose and positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) while performing an auditory continuous performance task (CPT). Five bilateral regions of interest (ROIs), namely dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), insula, inferior parietal cortex (INFP), thalamus and cerebellum, were correlated with normalized cerebral metabolism in the rest of the brain while covarying out Hamilton Depression Rating Scale Scores. In bipolar patients compared with controls, metabolism in the left DLPFC and IN FP, and bilateral thalamus and insula had more positive and fewer negative metabolic correlations with other brain regions. In contrast, compared with controls, Unipolar patients had fewer significant correlative relationships, either positive or negative. In common, bipolar and unipolar patients lacked the normal inverse relationships between the DLPFC and cerebellum, as well as relationships between the primary ROIs and other limbic regions (medial prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, and temporal lobes) compared with controls. Associations of DLPFC and INFP with other brain areas were different in each hemisphere in patients and controls. Bipolar patients exhibited exaggerated positive coherence of activity throughout the brain, while unipolar patients showed a paucity of normal interrelationships compared with controls. These abnormal patterns of metabolic associativity suggest marked interregional neuronal dysregulation in bipolar and unipolar illness exists beyond that of mere absolute regional differences from control levels, and provides rationale for using acute and long-term therapies that may re-establish and maintain normal associativity in these devastating illnesses.

The binding of the positron emission tomography ligand 2-[F-18]F-A-85380 to nAChRs was investigated in the porcine brain by quantitative autoradiography in vitro. The high-affinity binding of 2-[F-18]F-A-85380 to each of the investigated 12 brain areas was saturable and apparently monophasic (e.g., apparent K-D value of 1.72 nM in the thalamus). The highest density of specific binding sites was observed in the thalamus (1,158 fmol/mg protein), and the lowest density was measured in the cerebellar gray matter (11 fmol/mg protein). An attempt to assess nAChR subtype specificity of 2-[F-18]F-A-85380 was made by competitive autoradiography. Binding of 2-[F-18]F-A-85380 coincubated with 2-F-A-85380, epibatidine, cytisine, or methyllycaconitine, respectively, indicated a specificity of 2-[F-18]F-A-85380 to beta 2-containing nAChRs in the porcine brain.

In the superior colliculus, these calcium-binding proteins show different distribution patterns throughout the layers. After reaction for calretinin one observes a heavy staining of the neuropil with few labeled cells in superficial layers, a greater number of large and medium-sized cells in the stratum griseum intermediate, and small neurons in deep layers. The reaction for calbindin revealed a strong staining of neuropil with a large number of small and well stained cells, mainly in the upper half of the stratum griseum superficiale. Intermediate layers were more weakly stained and depicted few neurons. There were few immunopositive cells and little neuropil staining in deep layers. The reaction for parvalbumin showed small and medium-sized neurons in the superficial layers, a predominance of large stellate cells in the stratum griseum intermediate, and medium-sized cells in the deep layers. In the lateral geniculate nucleus of Cebus, parvalbumin is found in the cells of both the P and M pathways, whereas calbindin is mainly found in the interlaminar and S layers, which are part of the third visual pathway. Calretinin was only found in cells located in layer S. This pattern is similar to that observed in Macaca, showing that these calcium-binding proteins reveal different components of the parallel visual pathways both in New and Old World monkeys.

Despite the widespread acceptance of tamoxifen as a therapeutic agent for this disease, its effects on other estrogen-dependent pathways, particularly on neural circuits regulating brain function and peripheral hormone secretion, are poorly understood. The present study, using previously ovariectomized rhesus monkeys, examined the effects of tamoxifen, in both the presence and absence of estradiol replacement, on the reproductive and hypo-thalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axes. In Experiment 1, monkeys randomly assigned to three groups (n = 8 each) were treated with placebo and either two doses of estradiol, two doses of tamoxifen alone, or two doses of tamoxifen plus high-dose estradiol to assess the effects on negative feedback suppression of luteinizing hormone (LH). Both doses of tamoxifen effectively antag-onized the negative feedback efficacy of estradiol on LH secretion. In contrast, neither the low- or high-dose tamoxifen alone had any effect on LH secretion, as con-centrations during tamoxifen treatments were indistinguishable from those during placebo. In Experiment 2, females were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups (placebo, n = 6; estradiol, n = 5; tamoxifen only, n = 5; or tamoxifen plus estradiol, n = 6) to assess the effects on glucocorticoid negative feedback and pituitary and adrenal responsiveness to exogenous corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). Tamoxifen also antagonized the facilitating effects of estradiol on basal and CRH-induced ACTH and cortisol secretion. However, this antagonism produced basal and CRH-stimulated cortisol and ACTH concentrations that were lower than placebo-treated females. Interestingly, tamoxifen in the absence of estradiol produced a similar diminution in ACTH and cortisol response. These data suggest that, in the presence of estradiol, tamoxifen not only antagonized estrogenic facilitation of HPA responsivity but also actually attenuated the response compared with the placebo-treatment condition. Taken together, these data indicate that tamoxifen acts as an estrogen antagonist on the neural circuits controlling the neuroendocrine regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian and adrenal axes in ovariectomized macaque females.",estradiol; tamoxifen; SERM; LH; cortisol; ACTH; dexamethasone; corticotropin-releasing hormone; CORTICOTROPIN-RELEASING HORMONE; ADVANCED BREAST-CANCER; MESSENGER-RIBONUCLEIC-ACID; LONG-TERM TAMOXIFEN; POSTMENOPAUSAL WOMEN; RHESUS-MONKEYS; PARAVENTRICULAR NUCLEUS; GENE-EXPRESSION; RECEPTOR-ALPHA; ARGININE-VASOPRESSIN

Deer mice were reared under either enriched or standard housing conditions for 60 days following weaning. All mice were then placed in automated photocell detectors and classified as either stereotypic or non-stereotypic. Neuronal metabolic activity was then assessed using cytochrome oxidase (CO) histochemistry. The results demonstrated that environmental enrichment significantly increased neuronal metabolic activity in the motor cortex. Furthermore, non-stereotypic mice exhibited significantly more CO activity than stereotypic mice in the cortex, striatum, nucleus accumbens, thalamus, hippocampus and amygdala. This latter effect was due to the enriched mice as evidenced by a significant interaction between housing condition and behavioral status in the cortex, striatum, nucleus accumbens, thalamus and hippocampus. Thus, the observed increase in CO activity reflected increased neuronal metabolic activity in non-stereotypic enriched mice relative to stereotypic enriched mice. These results suggest that, in a developmental model of spontaneous stereotypy, the enrichment-related prevention of stereotyped behavior is associated with increased CO activity.

In order to understand further how auditory projections to AL contribute to emotional processing, acoustic response properties of single AL neurons were characterized in rats. Recordings were also made in the posterior striatum dorsal to AL. Many cells in AL and the striatum could be driven by broad-band auditory stimulation with white noise or clicks. Initial onset latencies were typically between 12 and 25 msec. Most cells also had later responses (60-150 msec), and a few only had late responses. In frequency receptive field tests, different classes of cells were identified. One group had relatively clear frequency preferences. Thresholds for these relatively tuned cells tended to be somewhat higher in AL than in the striatum. Frequency preferences for AL cells were always above 10 kHz. Although most striatal cells had preferences for frequencies above 10 kHz, some cells were found with frequencies below 10 kHz as well. A second group of acoustically responsive neurons, much more common in AL than in the striatum, showed no frequency specificity (untuned cells). These responded to a wide range of frequencies, even at intensities near threshold. A third group, found mainly in AL (approximately 60% of the total population of cells examined in AL), exhibited rapid habituation to auditory stimuli. These tended to have high thresholds (80-100 dB). Because these cells habituated so quickly, frequency specificity could not be determined. Responses in AL and the striatum were compared with responses in the specific auditory relay nucleus of the thalamus, the ventral division of the medial geniculate body, where cells had shorter onset latencies, narrower tuning functions, and lower-intensity thresholds than cells in AL and striatal areas. These findings show that cells in AL exhibit a wide range of auditory tuning properties and suggest that information processing in the amygdala might be fruitfully studied as a direct extension of processing in sensory afferent structures.",nan; MEDIAL GENICULATE-BODY; FEAR-POTENTIATED STARTLE; SUB-CORTICAL AFFERENTS; SINGLE NEURONS; RHESUS-MONKEY; CAT; ORGANIZATION; PROJECTIONS; CONNECTIONS; RAT

Methods: Carbon-11-CFT (WIN 35,428, 2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-fluorophenyl)tropan), C-11-CCT (RTI-131, 2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(4-monochlorophenyl)tropane), and C-11-CDCT (dichloropane, 2 beta-carbomethoxy-3 beta-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)tropane) were evaluated as imaging probes for dopamine neurons in five normal and in two MPTP-treated cynomolgus monkeys (macaca fascicularis) using a high-resolution PET imaging system (PCR-I). Results: For C-11-CFT, the specific binding ratio (as defined by the ratio of radioactivity levels in striatum versus cerebellum) was 4.2 +/- 0.8 in caudate and 4.9 +/- 1.2 in putamen at 60 min and 4.9 +/- 1.2 and 5.5 +/- 1.1 at 90 min in control animals. In MPTP-treated monkeys the corresponding ratios were 1.4 +/- 0.1 in caudate and 1.5 +/- 0.1 in putamen at 60 min and 1.3 +/- 0.1 in caudate and 1.4 +/- 0.3 in putamen at 90 min. For the monochloro analog of CFT, C-11-CCT, the ratios in control caudate and putamen were 2.7 +/- 0.4 and 3.4 +/- 0.3, respectively, at 60 min and 3.7 +/- 0.5 and 4.4 +/- 0.6, respectively, at 90 min. In MPTP-treated animals, corresponding ratios were 1.4 +/- 0.4 and 1.5 +/- 0.3 at 60 min and 1.4 +/- 0.4 and 1.6 +/- 0.4 at 90 min. The dichloro analog of CFT, CDCT, which has the highest affinity for the dopamine transporter, generated the lowest ratios in control brains, 2.3 +/- 0.4 in caudate and 2.4 +/- 0.5 in putamen at 60 min. In one MPTP-treated monkey, the corresponding ratios were 1.6 +/- 0.4 and 1.8 +/- 0.3. In comparison with C-11-CFT, both C-11-CCT and C-11-CDCT were less selective and had high uptake in the thalamus. Conclusion: The present results clearly indicate that C-11-CFT is a useful ligand for monitoring dopamine neuronal degeneration.","CFT (WIN 35,428); CCT (RTI-131); CDCT (dichloropane); positron emission tomography; Parkinson's disease; POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; RECOGNITION SITES; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; BRAIN DOPAMINE; PRIMATE MODEL; I-125 RTI-55; RAT-BRAIN; BINDING; INVIVO; AUTORADIOGRAPHY"

The neural mechanism underlying this sex difference is unknown. However, Bingel et al. (2007) have shown that pain habituation after 8 days of daily pain testing is associated with an increase in pain-evoked activity of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC), suggesting that pain habituation may be mediated via connectivity between the sgACC and the descending pain antinociceptive system. Therefore, we investigated whether women have stronger functional connectivity (FC) and greater structural connectivity (SC) compared to men between the sgACC and the descending antinociceptive system. Our analyses revealed that 1) women exhibited greater FC between the sgACC and the periaqueductal gray (PAG), raphe nucleus, medial thalamus, and anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC) than men; 2) men had stronger sgACC FC with the anterior insula and temporoparietal junction than women; 3) women and men exhibited comparable SC of the sgACC with the PAG, thalamus, aMCC, anterior insula, and amygdala; and 4) men have stronger sgACC SC with the hypothalamus than women. These data indicate that brain circuitry in women may provide for greater engagement of the descending modulation system mediating pain habituation. In contrast, in men, the salience network may be more engaged, which could support greater sustained attention to pain, thereby preventing pain habituation. Furthermore, the hypothalamus findings suggest a more powerful stress and endorphin-based system at play in men than women. (C) 2014 International Association for the Study of Pain.

Previous research shows that perceived angular size alters the spatial distribution of activity in early retinotopic visual cortex [7, 9-11]. For example, a sphere superimposed on the far end of a corridor scene appears to occupy a larger visual angle and activates a larger region of primary visual cortex (V1) compared with the same sphere superimposed on the near end of the corridor [7]. These previous results, however, were obtained from human subjects using psychophysics and fMRI, a fact that fundamentally limits our understanding of the underlying neuronal mechanisms. Here, we present an animal model that allows for a finer examination of size perception at the level of single neurons. We first show that macaque monkeys perceive a size-distance illusion similarly to humans. Then, using extracellular recordings, we test the specific hypothesis [12] that neurons in V1 shift the position of their receptive fields (RFs) in response to complex monocular depth cues. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that when ring-shaped stimuli appeared at the back of the corridor, RFs of V1 neurons shifted toward the center of the rings. When the same stimuli appeared at the front of the corridor, RFs shifted outward. Thus, our results show for the first time that V1 RFs can shift, potentially serving as the neural basis for the perception of angular size.",nan; SIMPLE CELLS; FEEDBACK CONNECTIONS; SPATIAL SUMMATION; THALAMIC INPUT; MACAQUE V1; SIZE; DISTANCE; AREA; ILLUSION; NEURONS

These effects are thought to be due to facilitation of thalamocortical synaptic transmission and/or suppression of intracortical connections. We have used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure the spatial spread of responses to visual stimulation in human early visual cortex. The cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil was administered to normal healthy human subjects to increase synaptic levels of acetylcholine in the brain. Cholinergic enhancement with donepezil decreased the spatial spread of excitatory fMRI responses in visual cortex, consistent with a role of acetylcholine in reducing excitatory receptive field size of cortical neurons. Donepezil also reduced response amplitude in visual cortex, but the cholinergic effects on spatial spread were not a direct result of reduced amplitude.

The pulvinar forms extensive connections with striate and extrastriate cortical areas, but the impact of these connections on cortical circuits has not previously been directly tested. Using a variety of anatomical, optogenetic, and in vitro physiological techniques in male and female mice, we show that pulvinocortical terminals are densely distributed in the extrastriate cortex where they form synaptic connections with spines and small-diameter dendrites. Optogenetic activation of these synapses in vitro evoked large excitatory postsynaptic responses in the majority of pyramidal cells, spiny stellate cells, and interneurons within the extrastriate cortex. However, specificity in pulvinar targeting was revealed when recordings were targeted to projection neuron subtypes. The neurons most responsive to pulvinar input were those that project to the striatum and amygdala (76% responsive) or V1 (55%), whereas neurons that project to the superior colliculus were rarely responsive (6%). Because the pulvinar also projects directly to the striatum and amygdala, these results establish the pulvinar nucleus as a hub linking the visual cortex with subcortical regions involved in the initiation and control of movement.

Many extrinsic cortical connections also form columnar terminations, but less is known about their fine organization. Results from intracellular injections of neighboring neurons (in rats: Johnson et al., 2000) suggest that even neurons within a common domain may have non-stereotyped projection patterns, with only partial overlap of terminal arbors. The issue of non-stereotyped projections at the columnar level is further considered by analysis of V1 axons terminating in primate area MT/V5 (an early visual area), and of an axon from temporal cortex terminating in area 7b (a higher cortical area). Both these axons have multiple non-uniform arbors. The implication is that each arbor recruits different numbers and possibly different combinations of postsynaptic elements. While more data are needed concerning convergence of connectional systems, and the actual identity and numbers of postsynaptic targets, the distributed spatial and laminar patterns do not evoke a repetitive uniformity, but rather a columnar substructure and the combinatoric possibilities of the 3-dimensional cortical organization.",nan; MACAQUE MONKEY; FEEDBACK CONNECTIONS; ASSOCIATION CORTEX; PYRAMIDAL CELL; CORTICAL AREAS; V1; PROJECTIONS; MORPHOLOGY; AXON; MT

In visual, auditory, and tactile sensory modalities, evaluation of afferent information engages brain regions outside of the primary sensory cortices. In contrast, evaluation of sensory features of noxious information has long been thought to be accomplished by the primary somatosensory cortex and other structures associated with the lateral pain system. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging and a delayed match-to-sample task, we show that the prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, posterior parietal cortex, thalamus, and caudate are engaged during evaluation of the spatial locations of noxious stimuli. Thus, brain mechanisms supporting discrimination of sensory features of pain extend far beyond the somatosensory cortices and involve frontal regions traditionally associated with affective processing and the medial pain system. These frontoparietal interactions are similar to those involved in the processing of innocuous information and may be critically involved in placing afferent sensory information into a personal historical context.",dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; anterior cingulate cortex; somatosensory; perceptual judgments; memory; evaluation; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; DECISION-MAKING; SOMATOSENSORY STIMULI; SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE; AUDITORY-CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; PERCEPTION; HUMANS; MEMORY; LOCALIZATION

It is now clear that higher primates have four strip-like representations of skin and muscle receptors corresponding to areas 3 a, 3 b, 1 and 2 of anterior parietal cortex. Areas 3 b and 1 receive cutaneous information from the ventroposterior nucleus, while a ventroposterior superior nucleus provides areas 3 a and 2 with information from muscle receptors. Area 3 b is the homolog of S-I in prosimians and non-primates and it provides most of the activating cutaneous inputs to areas 1 and 2. Most of the further processing that allows tactile recognition of objects involves somatosensory areas of the lateral sulcus, where both S-II and the parietal ventral area (PV) receive activating inputs from areas 3 a, 3 b, 1 and 2. S-II also projects to PV and to a parietal rostral area where further connections with the amygdala and hippocampus may occur to allow the formation of tactile memories. Areas of anterior parietal cortex also project to posterior parietal cortex, where regions of cortex are largely somatosensory, but the functional subdivisions remain uncertain.

The subiculum represents a laminar organization according to the location of pyramidal cells that project to the different subcortical nuclei; the most superficial portion of the pyramidal cell layer projects to the nucleus accumbens, the mid-portion of the layer projects to the medial nucleus of the mammillary body, and the deepest portion of the layer projects to the anteroventral thalamic nucleus. This laminar arrangement is consistently found along the entire septotemporal and proximodistal axes of the subiculum. Thus, these connectional data indicate that there is a distinct sublamination of the subicular pyramidal cell layer which has led to the suggestion that the subiculum may be analogous to the infragranular layer (layers V and VI) of the isocortex. Subsequently, the dentate gyrus and the hippocampus proper may be regarded as the supragranular layers (layers II and III), since the principal cells of these fields give off no descending projections. This proposed hypothesis is discussed from connectional as well as developmental, pathological and chemo-architectural points of view.

High-field functional magnetic resonance imaging of the brain was used to study the central processing of brief air-pulses, delivered to the peritonsillar region of the lateral oropharynx, in six healthy adults. Bilateral air-pulse stimulation was associated with the activation of a bilateral network including the primary somatosensory cortex and the thalamus, classic motor areas (primary motor cortex, supplementary motor area, cingulate motor areas), and polymodal areas (including the insula and frontal cortex). These results suggest that oropharyngeal stimulation can activate a bilaterally distributed cortical network that overlaps cortical regions previously implicated in oral and pharyngeal sensorimotor functions such as tongue movement, mastication, and swallowing. The present study also demonstrates the utility of air-pulse stimulation in investigating oropharyngeal sensorimotor processing in functional brain imaging experiments.

We here show that latexin-expressing neurons exhibit ultrastructural features common to cortical pyramidal neurons. We show in combined retrograde tracing and immunofluorescent experiments that latexin-expressing neurons contribute to specific cortico-cortical pathways. Thus, injections of the retrograde tracer fluorogold into either the primary somatosensory (SI) or the primary motor (MI) cortical area labeled many latexin expressing neurons in the infragranular layers of the secondary somatosensory (SII) and visceral sensory (Vi) areas. In contrast, tracer injections involving the thalamus, striatum, or contralateral SII and Vi exclusively labeled latexin-nonexpressing neurons in both the SII and Vi. Finally, we show that the correct corticocortical projections can be formed in organotypic slice cultures in vitro from latexin-expressing neurons: when slices of developing SII were cocultured with those from the SI and the thalamus, latexin-immunoreactive neurons in the SII projected preferentially to their normal SI target.

Horizontal and vertical small-field optokinetic stimulation activated the same multiple visual, ocular motor and vestibular cortical and subcortical areas in both hemispheres. The extent of activation in each hemisphere was independent of the stimulus direction. All activated areas representing cortical (occipitotemporal cortex, posterior parietal cortex, precentral and posterior median frontal gyrus, prefrontal cortex, medial part of the superior frontal gyrus) and subcortical (caudate nucleus, putamen, globus pallidus and paramedian thalamus) ocular motor structures were activated during optokinetic stimulation as well as during fixation suppression of optokinetic nystagmus. However, the activation was significantly stronger with optokinetc nystagmus compared with fixation suppression. The only relatively increased activity during fixation suppression was seen in the medial part of the superior frontal gyrus (supplementary eye field) and the anterior cingulate gyrus. The anterior insula and the posterior insula (human homologue of the parieto-insular vestibular cortex) were activated during optokinetic nystagmus but not during fixation suppression. A significant right hemispheric predominance (regardless of stimulus direction) was found under both conditions in the visual motion-sensitive and ocular motor areas of the cortex, except the supplementary eye field and anterior cingulate gyrus. This was most prominent in the occipitotemporal cortex, but did not occur in the primary visual cortex and in subcortical ocular motor structures (putamen, globus pallidus and caudate nucleus), Thus, cortical and subcortical activation patterns did not differ for horizontal and vertical optokinetic stimulation, and there was distinct right-hemisphere dominance for visual motion-sensitive and cortical ocular motor areas and the thalamus. Fixation suppression of optokinetic nystagmus yielded four different results: (i) increased activation in the supplementary eye field and anterior cingulate gyrus; (ii) unchanged activation in the visual cortex; (iii) decreased activation in most of the ocular motor areas; and (iv) suppressed activation in the anterior and posterior insula and the thalamus.

Material and Methods - The neuro-otological and neuro-radiological records of 179 patients clinically diagnosed as having SCD (91 males, 88 females; age range 20-89 years) and 48 patients diagnosed as having peripheral vestibular disorders (15 males, 33 females; age range 21-80 years) were reviewed. Subjects underwent caloric tests using cold water (20degreesC) in a totally dark room. Immediately after each test session, subjects were asked if they had experienced spinning or moving sensations during the test. Maximum slow phase eye velocities (SPEVs) were measured using electronystagmography. Results - Among patients with peripheral vestibular disorders, all patients with SPEVs >15degrees/s experienced spinning or moving sensations during testing. Among the 179 patients with SCD, 21 (39 sides) showed maximum SPEVs >15degrees/s without spinning or moving sensations. In particular, 8 patients (10 sides) had maximum SPEVs >25degrees/s without spinning or moving sensations. Common lesions in the cerebral cortex could not be detected using either MRI or single-photon emission CT. Conclusion - Patients with SCD may also have NSD, which may be attributable to subcortical lesions in the ascending pathways to the vestibular cortex.",caloric test; cerebello-cerebral diaschisis; nystagmus-sensation dissociation; spinocerebellar degeneration; thalamus; vestibular cortex; MONKEYS MACACA-FASCICULARIS; CEREBELLOCEREBRAL DIASCHISIS; VESTIBULAR NERVE; CORTEX; PROJECTION; RESPONSES; NEURONS

However, its functional role in the higher visual cortex remains unclear. Here, we observed visual cortical area activity in anesthetized mice to evaluate the role of the extrageniculate pathway on their specialized visual properties. Results: The preferred stimulus velocities of neurons in the higher visual areas (lateromedial [LM], anterolateral [AL], anteromedial [AM], and rostrolateral [RL] areas) were measured using flavoprotein fluorescence imaging and two-photon calcium imaging and were higher than those in the primary visual cortex (V1). Further, the velocity-tuning properties of the higher visual areas were different from each other. The response activities in these areas decreased after V1 ablation; however, the visual properties' differences were preserved. After SC destruction, these preferences for high velocities disappeared, and their tuning profiles became similar to that of the V1, whereas the tuning profile of the V1 remained relatively normal. Neural tracer experiments revealed that each of these higher visual areas connected with specific subregions of the LPN. Conclusions: The preservation of visual property differences among the higher visual areas following V1 lesions and their loss following SC lesions indicate that pathways from the SC through the thalamus to higher cortical areas are sufficient to support these differences.",nan; RECEPTIVE-FIELD PROPERTIES; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; FUNCTIONAL SPECIALIZATION; CELL RESPONSES; STRIATE CORTEX; NEURONS; MACAQUE; PROJECTIONS; MOTION; RAT

Its very fast uptake and clearance from the brain contrasts with that of methylphenidate, another drug that inhibits the DA transporter. Methylphenidate clears from the brain at a much slower rate and is less addictive than cocaine. We postulate that periodic and frequent stimulation of the dopaminergic system secondary to chronic use of cocaine favors activation of a circuit that involves the orbitofrontal cortex, cingulate gyrus, thalamus and striatum. This circuit is abnormal in cocaine abusers and we postulate that its activation by cocaine perpetuates the compulsive administration of the drug and is perceived by the cocaine abuser as a intense desire resulting in the loss of control over the drive to take more cocaine.",nan; OBSESSIVE-COMPULSIVE DISORDER; POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; HUMAN BRAIN; NUCLEUS ACCUMBENS; RHESUS-MONKEY; BABOON BRAIN; METHYLPHENIDATE; ABUSE; PHARMACOKINETICS; REINFORCERS

However, there is some debate as to the suitability of marmosets, compared to more widely used animal models, such as the macaque monkey and mouse. Especially, the usage of marmoset for animal models of human cognition and mental disorders, is still yet to be fully explored. To examine the prospects of the marmoset model for neuroscience research, the Marmoset Gene Atlas (https://gene-atlas.bminds.brain. riken.jp/) provides a whole brain gene expression atlas in the common marmoset. We employ in situ hybridization (ISH) to systematically analyze gene expression in neonate marmoset brains, which allows us to compare expression with other model animals such as mouse. We anticipate that these data will provide sufficient information to develop tools that enable us to reveal marmoset brain structure, function, cellular and molecular organization for primate brain research.

In addition, a small and heterogeneous collection of ganglion cell axons projects to the koniocellular layers of the LGN, to the superior colliculus (SC), and to other subcortical targets. The functional (receptive field) properties and target specificity of these non-parvocellular, non-magnocellular populations remain poorly understood. It is known that one population of koniocellular layer cells in the LGN (blue-On cells) receives dominant functional input from short-wavelength sensitive (S or 'blue') cones. Here we asked whether SC neurones also receive S cone inputs. We made extracellular recordings from single neurones (n = 38) in the SC of anaesthetised marmoset monkeys. Responses to drifting and flashed gratings providing defined levels of cone contrast were measured. The SC receptive fields we recorded were often binocular, showed 'complex cell' like responses (On-Off responses), strong bandpass spatial frequency tuning, direction selectivity, and many showed strong and rapid habituation to repeatedly presented stimuli. We found no evidence for dominant S cone input to any SC neurone recorded. These data suggest that S cone signals may reach cortical pathways for colour vision exclusively through the koniocellular division of the lateral geniculate nucleus.",nan; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; S-CONE SIGNALS; ALERT RHESUS-MONKEY; NEW-WORLD MONKEY; CALLITHRIX-JACCHUS; MACAQUE MONKEY; PRIMATE RETINA; SPATIAL PROPERTIES; VISUAL PATHWAYS

We focus on the process of working memory, based on circuit mechanisms for attending to relevant signals and suppressing irrelevant stimuli. We discuss that connections critically depend on the systematic variation in laminar structure across all cortical systems. Laminar structure is used to group areas into types regardless of their placement in the cortex, ranging from low-type agranular areas that lack layer IV to high-type areas that have six well-delineated layers. Connections vary in laminar distribution and strength based on the difference in type between linked areas, according to the structural model (Barbas H, Rempel-Clower N. Cereb Cortex 7: 635-646, 1997). The many possible pathways thus vary systematically by laminar distribution and strength, and they interface with excitatory neurons to select relevant stimuli and with functionally distinct inhibitory neurons that suppress activity at the site of termination. Using prefrontal pathways, we discuss how systematic architectonic variation gives rise to diverse pathways that can be recruited, along with amygdalar and hippocampal pathways that provide sensory, affective, and contextual information. The prefrontal cortex is also connected with thalamic nuclei that receive the output of the basal ganglia and cerebellum, which may facilitate fast sequencing of information. The complement of connections and their interface with distinct inhibitory neurons allows dynamic recruitment of areas and shifts in cortical rhythms to meet rapidly changing demands of sequential components of working memory tasks.","inhibitory neurons; memory; oscillations; prefrontal; structural model; LOCAL-CIRCUIT NEURONS; THALAMIC RETICULAR NUCLEUS; CORTEX AREAS 24A,B,C; DOUBLE BOUQUET CELL; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; GABAERGIC INTERNEURONS; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; ENTORHINAL CORTEX"

Their precise location, however, remains in dispute. For example, taste stimulation activates areas throughout the insula and overlying operculum, but identification of subregions has been inconsistent. Furthermore, literature reviews and summaries of gustatory brain activations tend to reiterate rather than resolve this ambiguity. Here, we used a new meta-analytic method [activation likelihood estimation (ALE)] to obtain a probability map of the location of gustatory brain activation across 15 studies. The map of activation likelihood values can also serve as a source of independent coordinates for future region-of-interest analyses. We observed significant cortical activation probabilities in: bilateral anterior insula and overlying frontal operculum, bilateral mid dorsal insula and overlying Rolandic operculum, and bilateral posterior insula/parietal operculum/postcentral gyrus, left lateral orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), right medial OFC, pre-genual anterior cingulate cortex (prACC) and right mediodorsal thalamus. This analysis confirms the involvement of multiple cortical areas within insula and overlying operculum in gustatory processing and provides a functional tastemap which can be used as an inclusive mask in the data analyses of future studies. In light of this new analysis, we discuss human central processing of gustatory stimuli and identify topics where increased research effort is warranted. Hum Brain Mapp 32:2256-2266, 2011.

These differences were also reflected in MGN neuronal size distribution: both male and androgenized female rats with microgyria had more small and fewer large neurons in their MGN in comparison to shams, while there was no difference in MGN neuronal size distribution between lesioned and sham females.

Unfortunately, dMRI fiber mapping is an indirect method that relies on inference from measured diffusion patterns. Comparing dMRI results with other modalities is a way to improve the interpretation of dMRI data and help advance dMRI technologies. Here, we present methods for comparing dMRI fiber orientation estimates with optical imaging of fluorescently labeled neurofilaments and vasculature in 3D human and primate brain tissue cuboids cleared using CLARITY. The recent advancements in tissue clearing provide a new opportunity to histologically map fibers projecting in 3D, which represents a captivating complement to dMRI measurements. In this work, we demonstrate the capability to directly compare dMRI and CLARITY in the same human brain tissue and assess multiple approaches for extracting fiber orientation estimates from CLARITY data. We estimate the three-dimensional neuronal fiber and vasculature orientations from neurofilament and vasculature stained CLARITY images by calculating the tertiary eigenvector of structure tensors. We then extend CLARITY orientation estimates to an orientation distribution function (ODF) formalism by summing multiple sub-voxel structure tensor orientation estimates. In a sample containing part of the human thalamus, there is a mean angular difference of 19 degrees +/- 15 degrees between the primary eigenvectors of the dMRI tensors and the tertiary eigenvectors from the CLARITY neurofilament stain. We also demonstrate evidence that vascular compartments do not affect the dMRI orientation estimates by showing an apparent lack of correspondence (mean angular difference = 49 degrees +/- 23 degrees) between the orientation of the dMRI tensors and the structure tensors in the vasculature stained CLARITY images. In a macaque brain dataset, we examine how the CLARITY feature extraction depends on the chosen feature extraction parameters. By varying the volume of tissue over which the structure tensor estimates are derived, we show that orientation estimates are noisier with more spurious ODF peaks for sub-voxels below 30 mu m(3) and that, for our data, the optimal gray matter sub-voxel size is between 62.5 mu m(3) and 125 mu m(3). The example experiments presented here represent an important advancement towards robust multi-modal MRI-CLARITY comparisons.",nan; nan

They discharge during both action execution and action observation and appear to play a crucial role in understanding others' actions. It has been proposed that the mirror mechanism is based on a match between the visual description of actions, encoded in temporal cortical regions, and their motor representation, provided by PMv and IPL. However, neurons responding to action observation have been recently found in other cortical regions, suggesting that the mirror mechanism relies on a wider network. Here we provide the first description of this network by injecting neural tracers into physiologically identified IPL and PMv sectors containing hand MNs. Our results show that these sectors are reciprocally connected, in line with the current view, but IPL MN sectors showed virtually no direct connection with temporal visual areas. In addition, we found that PMv and IPL MN sectors share connections with several cortical regions, including the dorsal and mesial premotor cortex, the primary motor cortex, the secondary somatosensory cortex, the mid-dorsal insula and the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, as well as subcortical structures, such as motor and polysensory thalamic nuclei and the mid-dorsal claustrum. We propose that each of these regions constitutes a node of an extended network, through which information relative to ongoing movements, social context, environmental contingencies, abstract rules, and internal states can influence MN activity and contribute to several socio-cognitive functions.",Grasping; Action observation; Action recognition; Anatomical connections; Motor; Parietal; VENTROLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MULTIMODAL ARCHITECTONIC SUBDIVISION; SINGLE CORTICOSPINAL NEURONS; ADJACENT CINGULATE CORTEX; LATERAL GRASPING NETWORK; SUPERIOR AREA 6; MACAQUE MONKEY; VENTRAL PREMOTOR; PRIMARY MOTOR; RHESUS-MONKEY

Based on primate studies, the PPC is composed of several subdivisions with differing connection patterns, including areas that exhibit retinotopy. In mice the composition of the PPC is still under debate. We propose a revised anatomical delineation in which we classify the higher order visual areas rostrolateral area (RL), anteromedial area (AM), and Medio-Medial-Anterior cortex (MMA) as subregions of the mouse PPC. Retrograde and anterograde tracing revealed connectivity, characteristic for primate PPC, with sensory, retrosplenial, orbitofrontal, cingulate and motor cortex, as well as with several thalamic nuclei and the superior colliculus in the mouse. Regarding cortical input, RL receives major input from the somatosensory barrel field, while AM receives more input from the trunk, whereas MMA receives strong inputs from retrosplenial, cingulate, and orbitofrontal cortices. These input differences suggest that each posterior PPC subregion may have a distinct function. Summarized, we put forward a refined cortical map, including a mouse PPC that contains at least 6 subregions, RL, AM, MMA and PtP, MPta, LPta/A. These anatomical results set the stage for a more detailed understanding about the role that the PPC and its subdivisions play in multisensory integration-based behavior in mice.",anterograde tracing; cortical map; posterior parietal cortex; retrograde tracing; visual cortex; LATERAL DORSAL NUCLEUS; MEDIAL ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; MOUSE; PROJECTIONS; ORGANIZATION; CONNECTIONS; AREAS; REPRESENTATION

Discharge patterns of neurons are regulated by synaptic inputs and by intrinsic membrane properties such as their complement of ionic conductances. Discharge patterns evoked by synaptic inputs are often used to identify the source and modality of sensory input. However, the interpretation of these discharge patterns may be complicated if different neurons respond to the same synaptic input with a variety of discharge patterns due to differences in intrinsic membrane properties. The purposes of this study were 1) to investigate intrinsic discharge patterns of neurons in primary somatosensory cortex of raccoon in vivo and 2) to use somatosensory postsynaptic potentials evoked by stimulation of forepaw digits to determine thalamocortical connectivity for the same neurons. 2. Conventional intracellular recordings with sharp electrodes were made from 121 neurons in the cortical representation of glabrous skin of digit four (d4). Intracellular injection of identical current pulses (100-120 ms in duration) elicited various patterns of discharge in different neurons. Neurons were classified on the basis of these intrinsic patterns of discharge, rates of spike adaptation, and characteristics of spike waveforms. Three main groups were identified: regular spiking (RS) neurons, intrinsic bursting (IB) neurons, and fast spiking (FS) neurons. Subclasses were identified for the RS and IB groups. 3. Neurons were tested for somatosensory inputs by stimulating electrically d3, d4, and d5. Excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) were elicited in 100% of the neurons by electrical stimulation of d4, the ''on-focus'' digit. EPSPs were usually followed by inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs). Many neurons (41%) responded with EPSP-IPSP sequences after stimulation of d3 or d5, the ''off-focus'' digits. 4. Latencies of somatosensory EPSPs and IPSPs were used to determine the synaptic order in the cortical circuitry of RS, IB, and FS neurons. EPSPs with monosynaptic thalamocortical latencies were recorded in RS, IB, and FS neurons. 5. We conclude that precise patterns of neural discharge in primary somatosensory cortex cannot be reliable estimates of sensory inputs reaching these neurons because patterns of discharge are so strongly influenced by intrinsic membrane properties. Ionic conductances governing patterns of neuronal discharge seem almost identical in intact cortex of raccoon, rat, and cat, and in slices of rodent cortex, because similar patterns of discharge are found. The consistency of patterns of discharge across species and types of preparation suggests that these intrinsic membrane properties are a general property of cerebral cortical neurons and should be considered when evaluating sensory coding by these neurons.",nan; SYNAPTIC RESPONSES; MOTOR CORTEX; NEOCORTICAL NEURONS; MACAQUE MONKEYS; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL PROPERTIES; FIRING PATTERNS; CORTICAL-CELLS; GLABROUS SKIN; RAT NEOCORTEX; DEEP LAYERS

However, significant gaps remain in our understanding how deprivation influences the development of visual acuity in mice. Here, we perform a longitudinal study assessing the effects of chronic deprivation on the development of the mouse subcortical and cortical visual circuits using a combination of behavioral optomotor testing, in vivo visual evoked responses (VEP) and single-unit cortical recordings. As previously reported, orientation tuning was degraded and onset of ocular dominance plasticity was delayed and remained open in chronically deprived mice. Surprisingly, we found that the development of optomotor threshold and VEP acuity can occur in an experience-independent manner, although at a significantly slower rate. Moreover, monocular deprivation elicited amblyopia only during a discrete period of development in the dark. The rate of recovery of optomotor threshold upon exposure of deprived mice to light confirmed a maturational transition regardless of visual input. Together our results revealed a dissociable developmental trajectory for visual receptive-field properties in dark-reared mice suggesting a differential role for spontaneous activity within thalamocortical and intracortical circuits.",nan; DARK-REARED CATS; MONKEYS MACACA-NEMESTRINA; UNILATERAL EYE CLOSURE; MONOCULAR DEPRIVATION; CRITICAL-PERIOD; DEPENDENT PLASTICITY; OCULAR DOMINANCE; PROLONGED SENSITIVITY; ANATOMICAL PLASTICITY; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY

The anterograde tracers Fluoro-Ruby (FR), Alexa Fluor (AT), and biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) were injected into physiologically identified regions of rat SI. Injection locations were confirmed by examining the SI barrel fields and limb representations in tangential sections processed for cytochrome oxidase (CO). Experimental animals were divided into two groups: one group received multiple tracer injections in neighboring SI regions that represent separate body parts (whiskers, forepaw, and hindpaw); the other group received injections in SI areas that represent different components of the forelimb (forepaw, antebrachium, and brachium). The distribution of labeled terminals and their varicosities in the neostriatum and in the thalamus were plotted and quantitatively analyzed. For most animals, tracer overlap in the thalamus was either minimal or completely absent. In the neostriatum, projections from the whisker, forelimb, and hindlimb representations terminated in regions that rarely overlap with each other, while those originating from different parts of the forelimb representation were more likely to terminate in overlapping parts of the neostriatum. To the extent that neostriatal activation depends on corticostriatal convergence, the corticostriatal projections in the sensorimotor channel appeared to be organized so that neostriatal neurons may signal when multiple components of the same body part are activated simultaneously.",nan; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; RAT BARREL CORTEX; BASAL GANGLIA; STRIATAL NEURONS; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; MACAQUE MONKEY; FUNCTIONAL-ANATOMY; PREMOTOR CORTEX; ORGANIZATION; REPRESENTATIONS

We investigated the cerebral representation of chronic lateralised ongoing pain in patients with painful mononeuropathy (PMN, i.e., pain in the distribution of a nerve, neuralgia) with positron emission tomography (PET), using regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) as an index for neuronal activity. Eight patients (29-53 years) with PMN in the lower extremity (4 in the right, 4 in the left) were recruited. Paired comparisons of rCBF were made between the patient's habitual pain (HP) state and the pain alleviated (PA) state following a successful regional nerve block (RNB) with lidocaine. The ongoing neuropathic pain resulted in activation of bilateral anterior insula, posterior parietal, lateral inferior prefrontal, and posterior cingulate cortices as well as the posterior sector of the right anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), Brodmann area (BA) 24, regardless of the side of PMN. In addition, a reduction in rCBF was noted in the contralateral posterior thalamus. No significant change of rCBF was detected in the somatosensory areas, i.e., SI and SII. The cerebral activation pattern, while addressing the differences between the HP and PA states, emphasises the affective-motivational dimension in chronic ongoing neuropathic pain. The striking preferential activation of the right ACC (BA 24), regardless of the side of the PMN, not only confirms that the ACC participates in the sensorial/affectional aspect of the pain experience but also suggests a possible right hemispheric lateralisation of the ACC for affective processing in chronic ongoing neuropathic pain.

Interplay between the two systems underlies the sensory and emotional aspects of pain, and was explored here in humans with simultaneous recordings from the amygdala, posterior and anterior insulae. Onsets of thermo-nociceptive responses were virtually identical in the posterior insula and the amygdalar complex, but no significant functional connectivity was detected between them using coherence analysis. Anterior insular sectors responded with similar to 30 ms delay relative to both the posterior insula and the amygdala. While intra-insular functional correlation was significant during the whole analysis period, coherence between the anterior insula and the amygdala became significant after 700 ms of processing. Phase lags indicated information transfer initially directed from the amygdalar complex to the insula. Parallel but independent activation of sensory and limbic nociceptive networks appear to converge in the anterior insula in less than one second. While the anterior insula is often considered as providing input into the limbic system, our results underscore its reverse role, i.e., receiving and integrating very rapidly limbic with sensory input, to initiate a perceptual decision on the stimulus 'painfulness'.",nan; OLD-WORLD MONKEY; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; POSTERIOR INSULA; RHESUS-MONKEY; NEURAL BASIS; CORTEX; HUMANS; RESPONSES; PERCEPTION; NETWORKS

To examine amygdala responses to aversive auditory stimuli, we exposed healthy human subjects to unpleasant sounds while regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was assayed with 0-15 PET. Eight subjects, all of whom described themselves as reactive to aversive sounds, participated in the study. Relative to white noise, the aversive sounds produced significant rCBF increases in the lateral amygdala/claustrum. region. Significant activations also localized to the dorsal brainstem, medial temporal pole, basal forebrain (nucleus accumbens), insula, right auditory association cortices, putamen, thalamus and cerebellum. These data indicate that the amygdala responds to aversive auditory stimuli in a manner similar to its response to unpleasant stimuli in other sensory modalities. The data further highlight a widely distributed network of cortical and subcortical areas activated during exposure to aversive sounds.

Due to the difficulties obtaining functional data at this age, the characteristics of the functional architecture at the onset of sensory thalamocortical connectivity in humans remain largely unknown. In particular, it is unknown to what extent responses evoked by an external stimulus are general or already sensitive to certain stimuli. In the present study, we recorded high-density event-related potentials (ERPs) in 19 neonates, tested ten weeks before term (28-32 weeks gestational age (wGA), that is, at an average age of 30 wGA) by means of a syllable discrimination task (i.e., a phonetic change: ba vs. ga; and a voice change: male vs. female voice). We first observed that the syllables elicited 4 peaks with distinct topographies implying a progression of the sensory input along a processing hierarchy; second, repetition induced a decrease in the amplitude (repetition suppression) of these peaks, but their latencies and topographies remained stable; and third, a change of stimulus generated mismatch responses, which were more precisely time-locked to event onset in the case of a phonetic change than in the case of a voice change. A hierarchical and parallel functional architecture is therefore able to process environmental sounds in a timely precise fashion, well before term birth. This elaborate functional architecture at the onset of extrinsic neural activity suggests that specialized areas weakly dependent on the environment are present in the perisylvian region as part of the genetic endowment of the human species.",brain development; EEG; ERP; language; MMN; premature; FETAL-BRAIN ACTIVITY; RHESUS-MONKEY; CEREBRAL SPECIALIZATION; SYLLABLE DISCRIMINATION; PRENATAL DEVELOPMENT; CORTICAL RESPONSES; SPEECH-PERCEPTION; EVOKED FIELDS; HUMAN INFANTS; IN-UTERO

Retrograde transneuronal transport of the CVS-11 (challenge virus strain 11) strain of rabies virus in cerebello-thalamocortical pathways revealed that the arm area of M1 receives input from Purkinje cells located primarily in lobules IV-VI of the cerebellar cortex. In contrast, transneuronal transport of rabies from area 46 revealed that it receives input from Purkinje cells located primarily in Crus II of the ansiform lobule. Thus, both M1 and area 46 are the targets of output from the cerebellar cortex. However, the output to each area of the cerebral cortex originates from Purkinje cells in different regions of the cerebellar cortex. Anterograde transneuronal transport of the H129 strain of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV1) revealed that neurons in the arm area of M1 project via the pons to granule cells primarily in lobules IV-VI, whereas neurons in area 46 project to granule cells primarily in Crus II. Together, the findings from rabies and HSV1 experiments indicate that the regions of the cerebellar cortex that receive input from M1 are the same as those that project to M1. Similarly, the regions of the cerebellar cortex that receive input from area 46 are the same as those that project to area 46. Thus, our observations suggest that multiple closed-loop circuits represent a fundamental architectural feature of cerebrocerebellar interactions.",rabies virus; transneuronal tracing; cerebral cortex; cerebellum; Purkinje cells; motor cortex; prefrontal cortex; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; BASAL GANGLIA; TRANSNEURONAL TRANSPORT; RHESUS-MONKEY; CORTICOPONTINE PROJECTION; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; EFFERENT PROJECTIONS; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; EXPERIMENTAL RABIES; FUNCTIONAL-ANATOMY

The primary auditory area (AI) occupies the cortex of the supratemporal plane (STP) and is surrounded by auditory association areas in circular sulcus and superior temporal gyrus (STG). Architectonic studies have parcellated auditory areas into a number of subregions. Beginning from the temporal polar proisocortex up to the parietal cortex, these areas shows progressive laminar differentiation, and are arranged into three parallel lines. The most medial line occupies the cortex of the circular sulcus. The regions of this line maintains limbic features and is termed as root line. Another line is located in STG. The regions of this line show progressive emphasis in the third and fourth layer neurons and is termed as belt line. Interposed between root and belt line is a core line located in STP. In this line there is greater accumulation of fourth layer neurons. Recent physiological studies have outlined several auditory representations surrounding AI. These auditory representations correspond to above mentioned architectonic subregions of STR. The subregions within each line have bidirectional connectional laminar specificity. The feedforward connections originate from the supragranular layer Ill and terminate in and around layer IV of the rostrally adjacent region. Feedback projections in constrast stem from the infragranular layers and terminate in layer I. The long association connections of auditory areas are with the prefrontal cortex (PFC), the multimodal areas and the limbic regions, and are derived from belt and root line areas of STR. These projections follow the rostro-caudal architectonic differentiation of STR. Thus the rostral STG areas are mainly connected with orbital and medial PFC areas whereas the caudal STG areas are connected with caudal PFC. The intermediate STG areas are preferentially related to the lateral PFC regions. It seems that STG-PFC connections are betwen the areas with similar level of architectonic differentiation. The thalamic connections of the subregions of STR also follow the architectonic organizations. The core line areas are preferentially related to ventral nucleus (MGv) of medial geniculate nucleus (MGN) whereas the root and belt line areas are connected respectively to magnocellular (MGmc) and dorsal (MGd) subdivisions of MGN. The root and belt areas share some connections and are also related to pulvinar, suprageniculate, dorsomedial and intralaminar nuclei. It seems therefore that progressive laminar and tripartrate organization of auditory regions of STR is reflected in intrinsic, association and thalamic connections. The feedforward connections may be engaged in analysis of external environmental cues whereas feedback connections may have a role in matching learned or stored information with incoming auditory signals. The preferential core line connectivity with MGv may be involved in spectral analysis of sound whereas the connections of the belt and root areas with MGmc, MGd, and pulvinar may have role in sound pattern recognition, auditory memory, the localization of sound in space as well as matching auditory information with other modalities.",nan; MEDIAL GENICULATE-BODY; RHESUS-MONKEY; ASSOCIATION CORTEX; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; TONAL STIMULI; TEMPORAL POLE; CONNECTIONS; PROJECTIONS; CAT; ORGANIZATION

This study assessed whether such atrophy is correlated with loss of gray matter volume in other brain regions. In 16 patients with TLE and clear magnetic resonance imaging-based evidence of hippocampal sclerosis, hippocampal volumes were determined manually and the local gray matter (LGM) amount was estimated throughout the entire brain using voxel-based morphometry. Voxel-wise correlations between the volume of the sclerotic hippocampus and LGM were computed. The pattern of voxels whose LGM correlated with hippocampal volume outlined remarkably well the anatomy of the extended limbic system and included the parahippocampal region, cingulate gyrus throughout its extent, basal fore-brain, thalamic nuclei, medial orbitofrontal areas and the insula. These correlations emerged mainly on the side ipsilateral to the affected hippocampus but were also found contralaterally. No such correlations were found in a group of 16 healthy controls. The present data show that hippocampal volume loss in TLE is associated with a widespread limbic systems atrophy. These findings are helpful to better understand the functional deficit and reorganization often found in temporal lobe epilepsy and will also provide a basis to assess neural plasticity in the limbic system for those patients who will undergo curative temporal lobe surgery.",epilepsy; neuroimaging; NMR; hippocampus; VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; PARAHIPPOCAMPAL GYRUS; CORTICAL CONNECTIONS; LANGUAGE DOMINANCE; PROJECTION NEURONS; RHESUS-MONKEY; MRI; ABNORMALITIES; SCLEROSIS; MEMORY

We did this to explore those brain regions required for both colour and pattern processing and to separate those areas of activation required for one or the other. We found that both tasks activated similar occipital regions, the major difference being more extensive activation in pattern recognition. A right-sided network that involved the inferior parietal lobule, the head of the caudate nucleus, and the pulvinar nucleus of the thalamus was common to both paradigms.

Psychophysical evidence indicated that the sensitivity for discriminating subtle stimulus changes in a same-different matching task was higher when subjects selectively attended to one attribute than when they divided attention among the attributes. PET measurements of brain activity indicated that modulations of extrastriate visual activity were primarily produced by task conditions of selective attention. Attention to speed activated a region in the left inferior parietal lobule. Attention to color activated a region in the collateral sulcus and dorsolateral occipital cortex, while attention to shape activated collateral sulcus (similarly to color), fusiform and parahippocampal gyri, and temporal cortex along the superior temporal sulcus. Outside the visual system, selective and divided attention activated nonoverlapping sets of brain regions. Selective conditions activated globus pallidus, caudate nucleus, lateral orbitofrontal cortex, posterior thalamus/colliculus, and insular-premotor regions, while the divided condition activated the anterior cingulate and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The results in the visual system demonstrate that selective attention to different features modulates activity in distinct regions of extrastriate cortex that appear to be specialized for processing the selected feature.

However, the neural mechanisms supporting these interactions remain poorly understood. By using combined psychophysical and functional MRI techniques, brain activation related to the intensity of expected pain and experienced pain was characterized. As the magnitude of expected pain increased, activation increased in the thalamus, insula, prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and other brain regions. Pain-intensity-related brain activation was identified in a widely distributed set of brain regions but overlapped partially with expectation-related activation in regions, including the anterior insula and ACC. When expected pain was manipulated, expectations of decreased pain powerfully reduced both the subjective experience of pain and activation of pain-related brain regions, such as the primary somatosensory cortex, insular cortex, and ACC.

The present study examined SAI in the flexor carpi radialis (FCR) muscle in individuals with spinal cord injury (SCI) and uninjured controls. Methods: Short-latency afferent inhibition (SAI) was evoked by stimulating the median nerve at the elbow at intervals of 15, 20 and 25 ms in advance of a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) pulse over M1. SAI was tested with the FCR at rest and also during similar to 20% of maximum voluntary contraction. Corticospinal output was assessed through measuring both motor thresholds and motor evoked potential (MEP) recruitment curves. The afferent volley was assessed via the N20-P25 amplitude of the somatosensory evoked potential (SEP) and the amplitude of sensory nerve action potentials (SNAP) recorded over the median nerve at the elbow. Results: SAI is reduced in SCI in both the contracted and non-contracted FCR muscle. MEP recruitment curves and thresholds were decreased in SCI only in the active state and not the resting state. N20-P25 amplitude was similar between groups in both the resting and active states although SNAP was significantly reduced in SCI at rest. Conclusions: We conclude that reduced SAI in SCI is likely attributed to neuroplasticity altering the intrinsic M1 circuitry mediating SAI and/or reduced afferent input traversing a direct thalamocortical route to M1. These data provide a new avenue of research aimed at identifying therapeutic approaches to alter SAI to improve upper limb function in individuals with SCI.",Afferent pathways; Motor evoked potential; Spinal cord injury; Cervical spinal cord; Short-latency afferent inhibition; Corticospinal tracts; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; MOTOR CORTEX EXCITABILITY; SELECTIVE FINGER MOVEMENT; SILENT PERIOD; CORTICAL EXCITABILITY; CORTICOSPINAL SYSTEM; STIMULUS-INTENSITY; RHESUS MONKEY; MEDIAN NERVE; HUMANS

The cortical regions occupied by these maps are generally believed to be determined initially by genetically controlled chemical markers during development, with thalamocortical afferent activity subsequently exerting a progressively increasing influence over time. Here we use a computational model to show that adjacent topographic maps with mirror-image symmetry can arise from activity-dependent synaptic changes whenever the distribution radius of afferents sufficiently exceeds that of horizontal intracortical interactions. Which map edges become adjacent is strongly influenced by the probability distribution of input stimuli during map formation. Our results suggest that activity-dependent synaptic changes may play a role in influencing how adjacent maps become Oriented following the initial establishment of cortical areas via genetically determined chemical markers. Further, the model unexpectedly predicts the occasional occurrence of adjacent maps with a different rotational symmetry. We speculate that such atypically oriented maps, in the context of otherwise normally interconnected cortical regions, might contribute to abnormal cortical information processing in some neurodevelopmental disorders.",nan; MONKEY AOTUS-TRIVIRGATUS; ORGANIZING FEATURE MAPS; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; HUMAN AUDITORY-CORTEX; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; SELF-ORGANIZATION; MACAQUE MONKEY; CORTICAL AREAS; MOTOR CORTEX; BODY-SURFACE

Methods [F-18]DBT-10 was produced via nucleophilic substitution of the nitro-precursor. Four Macaca mulatta subjects were imaged with [F-18]DBT-10 PET, with measurement of [F-18]DBT-10 parent concentrations and metabolism in arterial plasma. Baseline PET scans were acquired for all subjects. Following one scan, ex vivo analysis of brain tissue was performed to inspect for radiolabeled metabolites in brain. Three blocking scans with 0.69 and 1.24 mg/kg of the alpha(7)-nAChR-specific ligand ASEM were also acquired to assess dose-dependent blockade of [F-18]DBT-10 binding. Kinetic analysis of PET data was performed using the metabolite-corrected input function to calculate the parent fraction corrected total distribution volume (V (T)/f (P)). Results [F-18]DBT-10 was produced within 90 min at high specific activities of 428 +/- 436 GBq/mu mol at end of synthesis. Metabolism of [F-18]DBT-10 varied across subjects, stabilizing by 120 min post-injection at parent fractions of 15-55 %. Uptake of [F-18]DBT-10 in brain occurred rapidly, reaching peak standardized uptake values (SUVs) of 2.9-3.7 within 30 min. The plasma-free fraction was 18.8 +/- 3.4 %. No evidence for radiolabeled [F-18]DBT-10 metabolites was found in ex vivo brain tissue samples. Kinetic analysis of PET data was best described by the two-tissue compartment model. Estimated V (T)/f (P) values were 193-376 ml/cm(3) across regions, with regional rank order of thalamus > frontal cortex > striatum > hippocampus > occipital cortex > cerebellum > pons. Dose-dependent blockade of [F-18]DBT-10 binding by structural analog ASEM was observed throughout the brain, and occupancy plots yielded a V (ND)/f (P) estimate of 20 +/- 16 ml/cm(3).

Methods Healthy controls and migraineurs were categorized according to the International Classification of Headache Disorders criteria. Photophobia was measured under full-field illumination using electromyography in response to narrowband lights spanning the melanopsin and cone luminance action spectra. Migraineurs were tested during their interictal headache-free period. Melanopsin-mediated post-illumination pupil responses quantified intrinsically photosensitive Retinal Ganglion Cell (ipRGC) function. Results A model combining the melanopsin and cone luminance action spectra best described photophobia thresholds in controls and migraineurs; melanopsin contributions were similar to 1.5x greater than cone luminance. In the illumination range causing photophobia, migraineurs had lower photophobia thresholds (similar to 0.55 log units; p < 0.001) and higher post-illumination pupil response amplitudes (p = 0.03) than controls. Conclusion Photophobia is driven by melanopsin and cone luminance inputs to the cortex via the retino-thalamocortical pathway. In migraineurs, lower photophobia thresholds reflect hypersensitivity of ipRGC and cone luminance pathways, with the larger and prolonged post-illumination pupil response amplitude indicative of a supranormal melanopsin response.

Individuals with facilitated pain processing and/or reduced pain-modulatory capabilities are regarded as pronociceptive, whereas individuals with reduced pain processing capacity are characterized as antinociceptive. Brodmann area (BA) 3a of the primary somatosensory cortex is part of an ascending pathway from the sensory thalamus that mediates TSP. Descending pain modulation involves projections from the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) to the periaqueductal gray to the rostral ventromedial medulla (RVM). Here, we tested the hypothesis that pronociceptive individuals have an enhanced TSP response compared with antinociceptive individuals, marked by facilitated ascending nociceptive processing and/or reduced capacity for descending pain modulation. Eighty healthy humans were tested with a TSP protocol and underwent structural and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging. We found large interindividual differences in TSP responses, which were positively correlated with functional connectivity (FC) between individuals' right sensory thalamus with their BA 3a (thal-BA 3a), and with cortical thickness in their insula and medial prefrontal cortex. In contrast, TSP was negatively correlated with FC between individuals' RVM with their sgACC (RVM-sgACC). When subjects were grouped as pronociceptive or antinociceptive based on whether they had greater thal-BA 3a or RVM-sgACC FC respectively, pronociceptive subjects showed greater TSP responses. Furthermore, TSP was positively correlated with the extent of imbalance toward ascending nociceptive processing. Our study indicates that individuals with enhanced TSP have facilitated ascending nociceptive processing and reduced pain-modulatory capacities.",antinociception; functional connectivity; nociception; RVM; S1; temporal summation of pain; HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; CYTOARCHITECTONIC MAPS; PERIAQUEDUCTAL GRAY; CONNECTIVITY MRI; ANTERIOR INSULA; MACAQUE MONKEY; NOXIOUS HEAT; DORSAL-HORN; MODULATION; NEURONS

Methods-Positron emission tomography was used to measure changes in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in response to an acute experimental pain stimulus in six patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in comparison to six age and sex matched controls. A standardised and reproducible non-painful and painful phasic heat stimulus was delivered by a thermal probe to the back of the right hand during six two minute periods during which time measurements were made. The of non-painful heat were subtracted from those of painful heat to the analysis towards the nondiscriminatory or 'suffering' components of pain processing. Significance maps of pain processing were generated and compared in each group and contrasted with results obtained in a group of patients with atypical facial pain (AFP) that have been previously published. Results-The RA patients showed remarkably damped cortical and subcortical responses to pain compared with the control group. Significant differences between the two groups were observed in the prefrontal (BA 10) and anterior cingulate (BA 24) and cingulofrontal transition cortical (BA 32) areas. The reduced anterior cingulate responses to standardised heat pain were compared with the increased cingulate responses seen in patients with psychogenically maintained pain (AFP) who had both lower pain tolerance and mood than the RA group. Conclusions-Major cortical adaptive responses to standardised noxious heat can be measured and contrasted in patients with different types of chronic pain. The different pattern of cingulate and frontal cortical responses in the patients with inflammatory and nonnociceptive pain suggest that different mechanisms are operating, possibly at a thalamocortical level.

In this study, we examined in vitro the modulatory influence of acetylcholine (ACh) on the responses of SGS neurons that project to the visual thalamus in the rat. We used whole-cell patch-clamp recording to measure the responses of these projection neurons to electrical stimulation of their afferents in the stratum opticum (SO) before and during local pressure injections of ACh. These colliculothalamic projection neurons (CTNs) were identified during the in vitro experiments by prelabeling them from the thalamus with the retrograde axonal tracer wheat germ agglutinin-apo-HRP-gold. In a group of cells that included the prelabeled neurons, EPSCs evoked by SO stimulation were significantly reduced by the application of ACh, whereas IPSC amplitudes were significantly enhanced. Similar effects were observed when the nicotinic ACh receptor agonist lobeline was used. Application of the selective GABA(B) receptor antagonist 3-[[(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-methyl]amino]propyl]( diethoxymethyl)phosphinic acid blocked ACh-induced reduction in the evoked response. In contrast, the ACh-induced reduction was insensitive to application of the GABA(A) receptor antagonist bicuculline. The ACh-induced reduction was also diminished by bath application of muscimol at the low concentrations that selectively activate GABA(C) receptors. Because GABA(C) receptors may be specifically expressed by GABAergic SGS interneurons (Schmidt et al., 2001), our results support the hypothesis that ACh reduces CTN activity by nicotinic receptor-mediated excitation of local GABAergic interneurons. These interneurons in turn use GABA(B) receptors to inhibit the CTNs.",acetylcholine; nicotinic ACh receptors; muscarinic; ACh receptors; cholinergic circuits; interneurons; patch clamp; superior colliculus; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; MONKEY MACACA-MULATTA; PARABIGEMINAL NUCLEUS; RAT-BRAIN; INTERLAMINAR CONNECTIONS; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; TREE SHREW; RETINOTECTAL TRANSMISSION; CHOLINERGIC INNERVATION; EFFERENT CONNECTIONS

However, functional connectivity must rely on structural connections. In this study we applied a novel probabilistic fiber tracking method to assess the structural connectivity between the amygdala and different prefrontal brain regions in vivo. Twenty healthy subjects were investigated with diffusion tensor imaging. Probabilistic fiber tracking was started from the amygdala and different prefrontal brain regions. Resulting probability maps were combined using an extended multiplication of probabilistic maps to identify the most probable anatomical pathways connecting these structures. We found one ventral pathway through the uncinate fascicle, connecting the amygdala and the medial and lateral orbitofrontal cortices. In addition to this ventral pathway, we depicted distinct dorsal pathways (medial and lateral), which connect the amygdala with the anterior cingulate cortex and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The dorso-medial pathway proceeds through the inferior thalamic peduncle, while the dorsolateral pathway travels through the external capsule. We believe that our approach provides a promising tool to assess the integrity of specific structural connections in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

In macaque monkeys, a disconnection of prefrontal and temporal cortex produces severe new learning impairments in a range of complex learning tasks such as visuo-motor conditional learning and object-in-place scene learning. The retrograde effects of this disconnection, however, have never been fully examined. We therefore assessed the postoperative retention of 128 preoperatively learned object discrimination problems in monkeys with prefrontal-temporal disconnection using 1 trial postoperative retention tests. Because previous experiments have suggested that both spatial and temporal factors may be important in engaging frontal-temporal interaction we used object discrimination problems with a variety of spatial and temporal properties. Postoperatively, although monkeys with prefrontal-temporal disconnection displayed a retrograde amnesia for all problem types, subsequent assessments of new learning revealed selective anterogracle amnesia, which was limited to problems in which objects were presented as serial compound stimuli. The pattern of broad retrograde amnesia with selective anterograde amnesia contrasts with recent data from monkeys with lesions which disrupt subcortical-cortical connectivity and which show the opposite pattern, namely no retrograde amnesia but severe anterograde amnesia. These results support the hypothesis that visual memory acquisition is supported by subcortical-cortical interactions while the retrieval of visual memories normally depends on the interaction between prefrontal cortex and inferior temporal cortex.

Spatial memory processes, assessed by spatial delayed response and spatial reversal learning, showed a weak trend in the opposite direction, though on these tasks neither lesion produced a serious loss. Comparison of the present results with those of earlier studies on the effects of various limbic system lesions suggests that object memory processes, including object recognition and object-reward association, are served by a circuit consisting mainly of the rhinal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and the magnocellular division of the medial dorsal thalamic nucleus. Although both the rhinal and orbitofrontal components of this circuit appear to participate in both functions, evidence from the present and earlier studies suggests that the orbitofrontal component is the more important one for associative memory, i.e. the formation across trials of associations between particular objects or classes of objects and reward, whereas the rhinal component is the more critical one for recognition memory, i.e. the storage and retrieval within trials of the representations of particular objects.

Origin of CGRP-immunopositive axons was studied in the albino rat. Since beaded axons containing the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) are also present in the basal nucleus, the microstructural arrangement raises the question whether or not an interaction between CGRP and aAChR exists like in the neuromuscular junction. We found that electrolytic lesion of the parabrachial nucleus results in degeneration of CGRP-immunoreactive axons in the ipsilateral nucleus basalis and induces shrinkage of principal cholinergic neurons while the contralateral nucleus basalis remains intact. Electrolytic lesions in the thalamus, caudate-putamen, and hippocampus did not induce alterations in Meynert's basal nucleus. Disappearance of CGRP after lesions of the parabrachial nucleus does not impair presynaptic nAChR in the basal nucleus, suggesting that, unlike in the neuromuscular junction, CGRP is not involved in the maintenance of nAChR in the basal forebrain. It is concluded that the parabrachial nucleus is involved in the activation of the nucleus basalis-prefrontal cortex system, essential in gnostic and mnemonic functions.

To assess the organization of pallidothalamic projections originating from motor and associative portions of GPi, small quantities of the anterograde/retrograde tracer, biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) were injected into localized regions of the caudal GPi in squirrel monkeys. The localization to motor and associative territories in GPi was confirmed by examining the corresponding regions of retrograde labeling in the striatum and subthalamic nucleus (STN). The labeled pallidothalamic fibers projected principally medially across the inferior edge of the internal capsule. The fiber bundle ventral to the caudal GPi was mainly devoid of labeling. Fibers labeled along the medial and inferior borders of GPi at centrorostral levels were traceable to the medial edge of the injections. The densest fiber labeling at rostral levels was produced by those injections with the greatest extent of rostral labeling of neurons. In opposition to generally accepted schemes, the findings from this study suggest that the pallidothalamic fibers originating from the caudal portions of GPi, including the motor territory, do not course ventromedially to form the ansa lenticularis, but rather, travel predominately medially through the lenticular fasciculus en route to the thalamus. Thus, proposed surgical schemes to target fibers ventral to the caudal GPi or at the rostral pole of GPi appear to be misguided. J. Comp. Neurol. 429:490-501, 2001.

In the primate brain, it is implemented by a large-scale network that consists of areas spanning across all major lobes, also including subcortical regions. Classical attention accounts assume that control over the selection process in this network is exerted by lop-down' mechanisms in the fronto-parietal cortex that influence sensory representations via feedback signals. More recent studies have expanded this view of attentional control. In this review, we will start from a traditional top-down account of attention control, and then discuss more recent findings on feature-based attention, thalamic influences, temporal network dynamics, and behavioral dynamics that collectively lead to substantial modifications.

Because of technical constraints, the precise effects of TMS on cortical circuits are difficult to assess experimentally. Here, this issue is investigated by constructing a detailed model of a portion of the thalamocortical system and examining the effects of the simulated delivery of a TMS pulse. The model, which incorporates a large number of physiological and anatomical constraints, includes 33,000 spiking neurons arranged in a 3-layered motor cortex and over 5 million intra- and interlayer synaptic connections. The model was validated by reproducing several results from the experimental literature. These include the frequency, timing, dose response, and pharmacological modulation of epidurally recorded responses to TMS (the so-called I-waves), as well as paired-pulse response curves consistent with data from several experimental studies. The modeled responses to simulated TMS pulses in different experimental paradigms provide a detailed, self-consistent account of the neural and synaptic activities evoked by TMS within prototypical cortical circuits.",nan; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; NEURONS RECORDED INVIVO; PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; INTRACORTICAL INHIBITION; RAT NEOCORTEX; CORTICOSPINAL NEURONS; CONSCIOUS HUMANS; MACAQUE MONKEY; I-WAVES; ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION

Responsiveness of neurons in the distal forelimb region of primary somatosensory cortex (SI) was examined in cat in association with the cooling-induced, reversible inactivation of the corresponding region of the second somatosensory area (SII). The aim was to test whether a component of the stimulus-generated tactile input to SI came via an indirect, intracortical path from the thalamus through SIT, or whether, when SI responsiveness fell in association with STI inactivation, the effect could be explained by a disfacilitation of the SI neuron; that is, a removal of a tonic facilitatory influence on the SI neuron that arises from within SII. 2. The responses of 33 SI neurons to controlled tactile stimuli, usually l-s long trains of vibration or rectangular pulses delivered to the skin of the distal forelimb, were examined quantitatively before, during, and after the rapid, reversible inactivation of the SII area. 3. Nineteen of the 33 neurons (similar to 60%) were unaffected in their response level by SII inactivation. These included neurons of several functional classes whose input came from different classes of tactile afferent fibers, including the Pacinian corpuscle (PC) associated fibers, other rapidly adapting (RA) afferents from glabrous skin, and presumed hair follicle afferent (HFA) fibers. The remaining 14 neurons (similar to 40%). which also included different functional classes, displayed a reduction in response level with SII inactivation. Because this was not accompanied by significant prolongation of the SI spike waveforms, it is not attributable to direct spread of cooling from SII to SI. Construction of stimulus-response relations demonstrated that any effect of SII inactivation on individual SI neurons was consistent over the whole response range. 4. The fall in responsiveness for some SI neurons in association with SII inactivation may be attributable to disfacilitation, that is, a loss of tonic facilitation arising in SII, rather than to a block of peripherally generated inputs that traverse an indirect path from the skin to SI, via SII. There are three reasons for suggesting this. First, in the course of SII cooling, the latency and time course of SI evoked potentials were not delayed in a way that might be expected if part of the SI response had come via SII. Second, the SII inactivation could reduce the SI spontaneous activity (as well as the stimulus-related responsiveness). The facilitation from Sn is therefore not necessarily dependent on overt tactile stimulation, and its source may therefore be endogenous to SII. 5. Third, phase locking in the responses of SI neurons activated by vibrotactile stimuli was unchanged with SII inactivation, whether the response level was reduced or unaffected. Had the tactile inputs to SI come via both a direct and an indirect path (through SII) from the thalamus, the inactivation of SII should have eliminated some temporal differences in the inputs to the SI neurons and should have resulted in a tightening of phase locking in the responses to vibration. However, this was not seen. 6. The results demonstrate that tactile inputs to SI are conveyed over a direct path from the thalamus and do not appear to be carried over an indirect serially organized path through SII. However, there is evidence that SII can exert a background facilitatory influence on SI responsiveness. The observations are qualitatively the same and quantitatively very similar to earlier ones on the effects of SI on SII responsiveness in the cat, and they confirm that, in this species, SI and SIT constitute spatially separate cortical areas organized in parallel for the processing of incoming tactile information from the thalamus, but with each capable of modulatory influences on the responsiveness of the other area.",nan; SOMATOSENSORY CORTICAL AREA; COLUMN NUCLEI NEURONS; VIBRATORY INFORMATION; SENSORY FIBERS; 2ND; PROJECTIONS; MACAQUES; 1ST; RESPONSIVENESS; ORGANIZATION

The deficits likely derive from neural injury, reflected as structural damage and impaired functional brain responses to ventilatory and autonomic challenges. Brain structures playing essential memory roles, including the hippocampus and anterior thalamus, are damaged in CCHS. Other memory formation circuitry, the fornix and mammillary bodies, have not been evaluated. We collected two high-resolution T1-weighted image series from 14 CCHS and 31 control subjects, using a 3.0-Tesla magnetic resonance imaging scanner. Image series were averaged and reoriented to a standard template; areas containing the mammillary bodies and fornices were over sampled, and body volumes and fornix cross-sectional areas were calculated and compared between groups. Both left and right mammillary body volumes and fornix cross-sectional areas were significantly reduced in CCHS over control subjects, controlling for age, gender, and intracranial volume. Damage to these structures may contribute to memory deficiencies found in CCHS. Hypoxic processes, together with diminished neuroprotection from micronutrient deficiencies secondary to fluid and dietary absorption issues, may contribute to the injury.

In response to passively applied motion, the otolith organs of the vestibular system encode changes in the velocity and direction of linear self-motion (i.e., heading). When self-motion is voluntarily generated, proprioceptive and motor efference copy information is also available to contribute to the brain's internal representation of current heading direction and speed. However to date, how the brain integrates these extra-vestibular cues with otolith signals during active linear self-motion remains unknown. Here, to address this question, we compared the responses of macaque vestibular neurons during active and passive translations. Single-unit recordings were made from a subgroup of neurons at the first central stage of sensory processing in the vestibular pathways involved in postural control and the computation of self-motion perception. Neurons responded far less robustly to otolith stimulation during self-generated than passive head translations. Yet, the mechanism underlying the marked cancellation of otolith signals did not affect other characteristics of neuronal responses (i.e., baseline firing rate, tuning ratio, orientation of maximal sensitivity vector). Transiently applied perturbations during active motion further established that an otolith cancellation signal was only gated in conditions where proprioceptive sensory feedback matched the motor-based expectation. Together our results have important implications for understanding the brain's ability to ensure accurate postural and motor control, as well as perceptual stability, during active self-motion.",corollary discharge; efference copy; head motion; neuron; otolith; proprioception; HEAD DIRECTION CELLS; HORIZONTAL VESTIBULOOCULAR REFLEX; MONKEYS MACACA-FASCICULARIS; LINEAR DISPLACEMENT; FIRING PROPERTIES; PATH-INTEGRATION; THALAMUS NEURONS; NUCLEI NEURONS; SPATIAL MEMORY; EYE-MOVEMENT

How the brain constructs these coherent firing patterns remains largely unknown. Several mechanisms of intracortical synchronization have been considered, in particular mutual inhibition and reciprocal excitation. These mechanisms fail to account for the zero-lag correlations observed among areas located at different levels in the visual hierarchy because the asymmetric laminar organization of ascending and descending connections in this hierarchy would predict systematic inter-areal phase lags. Here we show through detailed computer simulations that, when triplets rather than pairs of reciprocally connected areas in a cortical hierarchy are considered, zero-lag synchronization emerges naturally from their three-way interactions. These simulations were motivated by the observation that most areas in the cat and macaque monkey visual cortex are organized in such triplets. Our results suggest that patterns of anatomical connections in the mammalian neocortex provide a structural basis for the multi-level synchronization of neuronal activity.

At the neuronal level this is supported by increased firing rates of neurons representing the attended object. In primary visual cortex an attention-mediated activity increase depends on the presence of the neuromodulator acetylcholine. Using a spiking network model of visual cortex we have investigated how acetylcholine interacts with biased feedback to enable attentional processing. Although acetylcholine affects cortical processing in a multitude of manners, we restricted our analysis to four of its main established actions. These were (i) a reduction in firing rate adaptation by reduction in M-currents (muscarinic), (ii) an increase in thalamocortical synaptic efficacy by nicotinic presynaptic receptors, (iii) a reduction in lateral interactions by muscarinic presynaptic receptors, and (iv) an increase in inhibitory drive by muscarinic receptors located on inhibitory interneurons. We found that acetylcholine contributes to feedback-mediated attentional modulation, mostly by reducing intracortical interactions and also to some extent by increasing the inhibitory drive. These findings help explain why acetylcholine is necessary for top-down-driven attentional modulation, and suggest a close interdependence of cholinergic and feedback drive in mediating cognitive function.",acetylcholine; attention; attractor networks; feedback; visual cortex; MUSCARINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; AREAS V1; SYNAPTIC-TRANSMISSION; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; SPATIAL INTEGRATION; NEURAL MECHANISMS; TEMPORAL CORTEX; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; MACAQUE V1

In our study, we investigated first the potential neurotoxic effects of remifentanil on the developing brain and then the effects of remifentanil on isoflurane-induced apoptosis in the neonatal rat brain following exposure to a nociceptive stimulus. In the first experiment, postnatal day (P) 7 rats were randomly exposed to 30% oxygen, 1.5% isoflurane alone, 1.5% isoflurane and a plantar incision, normal saline, or remifentanil at a low (5 mu g.kg(-1).h(-1)), moderate (20 mu g.kg(-1).h(-1)) or high (80 mu g.kg(-1).h(-1)) dose for 4 h. In the second 4-h experiment, P7 rats were randomly exposed to 1.5% isoflurane, infused with different doses of remifentanil (5, 10, and 20 mu g.kg(-1).h(-1)), and subjected to a plantar incision. In both experiments, the number of apoptotic neurons in the cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus was assessed after two hours by cleaved caspase-3 or TUNEL staining. Our data showed that unlike 1.5% isoflurane, remifentanil at any dose did not cause significant neuronal apoptosis in any brain section. In addition, in response to a nociceptive stimulus, the infusion of 10 mu g.kg(-1).h(-1) remifentanil reduced isoflurane-induced apoptosis in the hippocampus (P = 0.003 in CA1, P = 0.002 in CA3) but not in the cortex or thalamus. Our findings suggest that remifentanil does not induce apoptosis and reduces isoflurane-induced apoptosis in the developing brain.",Opioid effect; neurotoxicity; developing brain; remifentanil; PATIENT-CONTROLLED ANALGESIA; RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED-TRIAL; RHESUS MACAQUE BRAIN; CONTEXTUAL FEAR; CELL-DEATH; ANESTHESIA; NEURONS; FETAL; PAIN; DIFFERENTIATION

Group analyses showed significant differences in activation in the hunger minus satiety condition in response to sucrose, caffeine, saccharin, and citric acid within the thalamus, hippocampus, and parahippocampus. When examining the hunger and satiety conditions, activation varied as a function of stimulus, with the majority of the stimuli exhibiting significantly greater activation in the hunger state within the insula, thalamus, and substantia nigra, in contrast to decreased activation in the satiated state within the parahippocampus, hippocampus, amygdala, and anterior cingulate. Region of interest (ROI) analysis revealed two significant interactions, ROI by physiology and ROI by physiology by stimulus. In the satiety condition, the primary (inferior and superior insulae) and secondary (OFC 11 and OFC 47) taste regions exhibited significantly greater brain activation in response to all stimuli than regions involved in processing eating behavior (hypothalamus), affect (amygdala), and memory (hippocampus, parahippocampus and entorhinal cortex). These same regions demonstrated significantly greater activation within the hunger condition than the satiety condition, with the exception of the superior insula. Furthermore, the patterns of activation differed as a function taste stimulus, with greater activation in response to sucrose than to the other stimuli. These differential patterns of activation suggest that the physiological states of hunger and satiety produce divergent activation in multiple brain areas in response to different pure gustatory stimuli.

Two different spatial normalization approaches that are available in public domain software (free-form deformation (FFD) and discrete cosine transform (DCT)) were compared for accuracy of normalization in the PFBT patients. Anatomical landmark matching demonstrated that spatial normalization was more accurate with FFD than with DCT. Voxel-based morphometry of the FFD-normalized magnetic resonance images from PFBT survivors and sibling controls detected reduced gray matter density in the thalamus and ent orhinal cortex and reduced white matter density in the internal capsule, hypothalamus, corpus callosum, and cuneus of the occipital lobe in the PFBT survivors.

Structures connecting bodily signals and interoceptive awareness could trigger, in a feedforward manner, behavioral responses appropriate to maintain a desired state of the cardiovascular system. The present functional magnetic resonance imaging study aimed at identifying brain structures that are mutually activated during interoceptive awareness of heartbeats and during cardiovascular arousal. Additionally, we searched for brain regions connecting interoception with feelings. During the interoceptive task (directing attention towards heartbeats in relation to an exteroceptive task) the thalamus, the insula, the medial frontal/dorsal cingulate and the inferior frontal gyrus, as well as the somatomotor cortex were activated. The conjunction of the interoceptive awareness of heartbeats and cardiovascular arousal revealed structures presumably connecting both conditions, i.e. the right thalamus, insula, somatomotor cortex, and the dorsal cingulate as well as medial frontal gyrus. Furthermore, the degree of interoceptive awareness predicted the degree of activation of both the insula and the medial frontal/dorsal cingulate gyrus. Negative feelings correlated with the BOLD response of the interoceptive awareness condition in the dorsal cingulate gyrus extending into the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex. We provide evidence that the insula, the dorsal cingulate gyrus, and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex are specifically involved in processing cardiac sensations. The dorsal cingulate gyrus and the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex presumably represent the neural substrates of experiencing negative emotions. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

This brings objects of interest into the fovea and keeps them there, but visual sensitivity has been shown to deteriorate while the eyes are moving. Here we show that human sensitivity for some visual stimuli is improved during smooth pursuit eye movements. Detection thresholds for briefly flashed, colored stimuli were 16% lower during pursuit than during fixation. Similarly, detection thresholds for luminance-defined stimuli of high spatial frequency were lowered. These findings suggest that the pursuit-induced sensitivity increase may have its neuronal origin in the parvocellular retino-thalamic system. This implies that the visual system not only uses feedback connections to improve processing for locations and objects being attended to, but that a whole processing subsystem can be boosted. During pursuit, facilitation of the parvocellular system may reduce motion blur for stationary objects and increase sensitivity to speed changes of the tracked object.",nan; CONTRAST SENSITIVITY; FRONTAL-CORTEX; MOTION; COLOR; MACAQUE; NEURONS; MONKEYS; PERCEPTION; POSITION; SYSTEM

Each strain was injected into the arm area of the primary motor cortex. One strain, HSV-1(McIntyre-B), was transported transneuronally in the retrograde direction. It infected neurons at sites known to project to the arm area of the primary motor cortex (e.g., ventrolateral thalamus). In addition, second-order neurons were labeled in the deep cerebellar nuclei (dentate and interpositus) and in the globus pallidus (internal segment). This result supports the concept that the arm area of the primary motor cortex is a target of both cerebellar and basal ganglia output. In contrast, the other strain, HSV-1(H129), was transported transneuronally in the anterograde direction. It infected neurons at sites known to receive input from the arm area of the primary motor cortex (e.g., putamen, pontine nuclei). In addition, third-order neurons were labeled in the cerebellar cortex (granule and Golgi cells) and in the globus pallidus (largely the external segment). Our observations suggest that strain differences have an important impact on the direction of transneuronal transport of HSV-1. Furthermore, it should be possible to examine the organization of cerebellar and basal ganglia loops with cerebral cortex by exploiting transneuronal transport of HSV-1 and virus strain differences.",MOTOR CORTEX; BASAL GANGLIA; CEREBELLUM; AXONAL TRANSPORT; CEBUS-APELLA; MACACA-FASCICULARIS; MACAQUE MONKEY; CORTICOPONTINE PROJECTION; MOLECULAR EPIDEMIOLOGY; NEURONAL TRANSFER; ARCUATE PREMOTOR; PRECENTRAL GYRUS; GLOBUS PALLIDUS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; BASAL GANGLIA

Current evidence suggests that pathological brain connectivity could be a major contributor to the propagation of focal seizures, constituting a possible cause for some forms of intractable epilepsy. Currently, however, the precise network structures that underpin epileptic brain connectivity are poorly understood. In this study, we use a computational model to simulate focal seizure spread in the macaque cortical connectome. We then use the results to propose a novel network centrality measure (called Ictogenic Centrality) that accurately identifies which nodes are most effective in propagating seizures. In the framework presented, ictogenic centrality outperforms other standard centrality measures in correctly identifying ictogenic nodes, exhibiting high accuracy (0.947), specificity (0.939), and sensitivity (0.964). Ictogenic centrality is degree based and relies on only a single free parameter, making it useful and efficient to compute for large networks. Our results suggest that baseline brain connectivity may predispose the temporal and frontal lobes toward ictogenicity even in the absence of any overtly pathological network reorganization.",Epilepsy; Seizure; Connectome; Centrality; DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; GENERALIZED SEIZURES; ANTERIOR NUCLEUS; LONG; CONNECTIVITY; SURGERY; CONNECTOME; THALAMUS; OUTCOMES

To evaluate potential sources of this visual input and how they enter into the circuitry of the auditory cortex, we examined axonal terminations in the primary auditory cortex from nonprimary extrastriate visual cortex (V2M, V2L) and from the multimodal thalamic suprageniculate nucleus (SG). Gross biocytin/biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) injections into the SG or extrastriate cortex labeled inputs terminating primarily in superficial and deep layers. SG projects primarily to layers I, V, and VI while V2M and V2L project primarily to layers I and VI, with V2L also targeting layers Layer I inputs differ in that SG terminals are concentrated superficially, V2L are deeper, and V2M are equally distributed throughout. Individual axonal reconstructions document that single axons can 1) innervate multiple layers; 2) run considerable distances in layer I; and 3) run preferentially in the dorsoventral direction similar to isofrequency axes. At the electron microscopic level, SG and V2M terminals 1) are the same size regardless of layer; 2) are non-gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic; 3) are smaller than ventral medial geniculate terminals synapsing in layer IV; 4) make asymmetric synapses onto dendrites/spines that 5) are non-GABAergic and 6) are slightly larger in layer I. Thus, both areas provide a substantial feedback-like input with differences that may indicate potentially different roles. J. Comp. Neurol. 518:36793700, 2010.

Bilateral patterns of activation in the visual cortex, including the motion-sensitive area MT/V5, and deactivations in an assembly of vestibular areas (posterior insula, thalamus, anterior cingulate gyrus) during optokinetic nystagmus was markedly diminished or totally absent during its fixation suppression. This finding agrees with the concept of a reciprocal inhibitory interaction between the visual-optokinetic and the vestibular systems, which takes place at a lower level during fixation suppression, because the potential mismatch between the two sensory inputs, visual and vestibular, is then reduced.

Data on structural and perfusion MRI in the brain were collected from 202 healthy children aged 5-18 years. Gender differences in brain perfusion using partial volume correction (PVC), which was calculated by dividing the normalized perfusion MRI by the normalized gray-matter segments, were analyzed by applying voxel-based analysis and region-of-interest (ROI) analysis. Girls showed significantly higher brain perfusion with PVC in the bilateral medial aspect of the parietal lobes, including the posterior cingulate cortex and precuneus, as compared to boys using voxel-based analysis. In addition, brain perfusion with PVC in the bilateral posterior cingulate cortex, bilateral precuneus, and left thalamus was significantly higher in girls than in boys in the ROI analysis. In contrast, no regions were seen in which boys exhibited higher brain perfusion with PVC than girls in both analyses. The findings showed significant differences between boys and girls in brain perfusion with PVC, and these differences may contribute to gender differences in the cognitive ability of healthy children.

This paper proposes that these features of the visual system reflect, in part at least, its solution to a geometric problem inherent in binocular vision. Points in the visual quadrants are imaged on geometrically non-corresponding retinal points. Two such retinal loci, optically conjugate with a given visual point at one fixation distance or angle, will correspond to no single visual point at other fixation distances or angles. This raises potential problems for visual cortical neurons sensitive to a narrow range of binocular disparities. If these neurons are to function optimally at a variety of fixation distances and angles, their disparity tuning must be variable. It is suggested here that such dynamic disparity tuning is effected by the corticogeniculate projection acting on the segregated ocular representations in the geniculate laminae.",nan; RECEPTIVE-FIELD PROPERTIES; VISUAL-CORTEX; NUCLEUS; NEURONS; DEPTH; TRANSMISSION; STRIATE; MACAQUE; MONKEY; CAT

The rmPFC was determined by its afferent projections from the medial half of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus. The rmPFC neurons were identified by their antidromic activation from the mediodorsal nucleus and/or by their firing characteristics. The rmPFC neurons increased their firing during the first conditioning sessions, but decreased it when conditioned responses (CRs) reached asymptotic values. Therefore, no significant relationships could be established between neuronal firing rates and the percentage of CRs or the electromyographic (EMG) activity of the orbicularis oculi muscle during conditioning. Electrical train stimulation of the rmPFC produced a significant inhibition of air-puff-evoked blinks and reduced the generation of CRs compared with controls. Inhibition of the rmPFC by the local injection of lidocaine produced an increase in the amplitude of evoked reflex and conditioned eyeblinks and in the percentage of CRs. The rmPFC seems to be a potent inhibitor of reflex and conditioned eyeblinks, controlling the release of newly acquired eyelid responses until advanced stages of the acquisition process-i.e., until the need for the acquired response is fully confirmed. Therefore, the rmPFC seems to act as a flip-flop mechanism in controlling behavior.",nan; REFLEX BLINK HYPEREXCITABILITY; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; ORYCTOLAGUS-CUNICULUS; MEDIODORSAL NUCLEUS; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; PAVLOVIAN EYEBLINK; FACIAL NUCLEUS; RHESUS-MONKEY

The mechanisms by which such a large-scale network could induce or modulate anxiety-like states are largely unknown. This article reviews our experimental program in macaques demonstrating a causal involvement of local striatal and frontal cortical sites in inducing pessimistic decision-making that underlies anxiety. Where relevant, we related these findings to the wider literature. To identify such sites, we have made a series of methodologic advances, including the combination of causal evidence for behavioral modification of pessimistic decisions with viral tracing methods. Critically, we introduced a version of the classic approach-avoidance (Ap-Av) conflict task, modified for use in non-human primates. We performed microstimulation of limbic-related cortical regions and the striatum, focusing on the pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC), the caudal orbitofrontal cortex (cOFC), and the caudate nucleus (CN). Microstimulation of localized sites within these regions induced pessimistic decision-making by the monkeys, supporting the idea that the focal activation of these regions could induce an anxiety-like state, which subsequently influences decision-making. We further performed combined microstimulation and tract-tracing experiments by injecting anterograde viral tracers into focal regions, at which microstimulation induced increased avoidance. We found that effective stimulation sites in both pACC and cOFC zones projected preferentially to striosomes in the anterior striatum. Experiments in rodents have shown that the striosomes in the anterior striatum project directly to the dopamine-containing cells in the substantia nigra, and we have found evidence for a functional connection between striosomes and the lateral habenular region in which responses to reward are inhibitory. We present here further evidence for network interactions: we show that the pACC and cOFC project to common structures, including not only the anterior parts of the striosome compartment but also the tail of the CN, the subgenual ACC, the amygdala, and the thalamus. Together, our findings suggest that networks having pACC and cOFC as nodes share similar features in their connectivity patterns. We here hypothesize, based on these results, that the brain sites related to pessimistic judgment are mediated by a large-scale brain network that regulates dopaminergic functions and includes striosomes and striosome-projecting cortical regions.",anxiety; caudal orbitofrontal cortex; pregenual anterior cingulate cortex; approach-avoidance conflict; monkey; microstimulation; striosome compartment; caudate nucleus; ROSTROMEDIAL TEGMENTAL NUCLEUS; SOCIAL ANXIETY DISORDER; BASAL GANGLIA; MATRIX COMPARTMENTS; ANTERIOR CINGULATE; AVOIDANCE TENDENCIES; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; LATERAL HABENULA; DOPAMINE NEURONS

Objective: To test the hypotheses that DBS would increase cerebral glucose metabolism in cortical and hippocampal circuits and that increased metabolism would be correlated with better clinical outcomes. Design: Open-label trial. Setting: Academic medical center. Patients: A total of 5 patients with mild, probable AD (1 woman and 4 men, with a mean [SD] age of 62.6 [4.2] years). Intervention: Deep brain stimulation of the fornix. Main Outcome Measures: All patients underwent clinical follow-up and high-resolution positron emission tomography studies of cerebral glucose metabolism after 1 year of DBS. Results: Functional connectivity analyses revealed that 1 year of DBS increased cerebral glucose metabolism in 2 orthogonal networks: a frontal-temporal-parietal-striatal-thalamic network and a frontal-temporal-parietal-occipital-hippocampal network. In similar cortical regions, higher baseline metabolism prior to DBS and increased metabolism after 1 year of DBS were correlated with better outcomes in global cognition, memory, and quality of life. Conclusions: Increased connectivity after 1 year of DBS is observed, which is in contrast to the decreased connectivity observed over the course of AD. The persistent cortical metabolic increases after 1 year of DBS were associated with better clinical outcomes in this patient sample and are greater in magnitude and more extensive in the effects on cortical circuitry compared with the effects reported for pharmacotherapy over 1 year in AD.

Current theories hypothesize that animals maintain a neural representation, or cognitive map, of external space in the brain. Whereas cells in the rat hippocampus and parahippocampal regions encode information about location, a second type of allocentric spatial cell encodes information about the animal's directional heading, independent of the animal's on-going behaviors. These head direction (HD) cells are found in several areas of the classic Papez circuit. This review focuses on experimental studies conducted on HD cells and describes their discharge properties, functional significance, role in path integration, and responses to different environmental manipulations. The anterior dorsal thalamic nucleus appears critical for the generation of the directional signal. Both motor and vestibular cues also play important roles in the signal's processing. The neural network models proposed to account for HD cell firing are compared with known empirical findings. Examples from clinical cases of patients with topographical disorientation are also discussed. It is concluded that studying the neural mechanisms underlying the HD signal provides an excellent opportunity for understanding how the mammalian nervous system processes a high level cognitive signal.

Results: Significant axonal loss in the contralateral corticospinal tract and abnormally enlarged axons in the ipsilateral were observed in monkeys with MCAO. The number of neurons in the contralateral ventral horn got declined while that in the ipsilateral was almost unaffected after MCAO compared with sham controls. Glial activation post-MCAO was observed in the bilateral corticospinal tract and the ventral horn. Aberrant nerve fibers appeared frequently in the contralateral ventral roots of MCAO monkey but rarely in the ipsilateral. Conclusions: These results indicate that focal cerebral infarction leads to pathological alterations in the spinal cord and ventral roots in non-human primates.",Cerebral infarction; secondary damage; spinal cord; ventral root; non-human primates; WALLERIAN DEGENERATION; ISCHEMIC-STROKE; CORTICOSPINAL PROJECTIONS; MICROGLIAL ACTIVATION; RATS; NEURODEGENERATION; EXPRESSION; PATHOLOGY; THALAMUS; NEURONS

Methods: Singular value decomposition was used to produce 20 SPECT factors (known as vectors) (n = 152). Vector scores were then computed for four groups (n = 136), differing in cognitive status: Group 1-normal controls at both baseline and follow-up; Group 2-subjects with questionable AD at both baseline and follow-up; Group 3-subjects with questionable AD at baseline who converted to AD on follow-up (Converters); Group 4-subjects with AD at baseline. All SPECT data in the analyses were gathered at baseline. Results: The four groups could be distinguished on the basis of their baseline SPECT data (p less than or equal to 0.00005; hit rate = 83%), Regional decreases in perfusion were most prominent among Converters in the hippocampalamygdaloid complex, the posterior cingulate, the anterior thalamus, and the anterior cingulate. Inclusion of apolipoprotein E status did not significantly improve the discrimination. Conclusions: SPECT data gathered and analyzed in this manner may be useful as one aspect of the preclinical prediction of AD. Three of the four brain regions important for discriminating Converters from normal controls involve a distributed brain network pertaining to memory, suggesting that this network may be selectively affected in the earliest stages of AD.",nan; POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; CEREBRAL GLUCOSE-METABOLISM; APOLIPOPROTEIN-E; RHESUS-MONKEY; BLOOD-FLOW; HIPPOCAMPAL; DEMENTIA; ALLELE; MEMORY; ABNORMALITIES

In fMRI experiment 1, a linear relationship between familiarity with lyrics and activation was found in left-hemispheric speech-related as well as bilateral striatal areas which is in line with previous research on generation of lyrics. In fMRI experiment 2, we employed so called Mondegreens and Soramimi to induce misperceptions of lyrics revealing a bilateral network including middle temporal and inferior frontal areas as well as anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and mediodorsal thalamus. ACC activation also correlated with the extent to which misperceptions were judged as amusing corroborating previous neuroimaging results on the role of this area in mediating the pleasant experience of chills during music perception. Finally, we examined the areas engaged during misperception of lyrics using diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) to determine their structural connectivity. These combined fMRI/DWI results could serve as a neurobiological model for future studies on other types of misunderstanding which are events with potentially strong impact on our social life.

Perception of fearful facial expressions has been extensively studied, appearing to depend upon the amygdala(2-6). Disgust-literally 'bad taste'-is another important emotion, with a distinct evolutionary history(7), and is conveyed by a characteristic facial expression(8-10). We have used functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to examine the neural substrate for perceiving disgust expressions. Normal volunteers were presented with faces showing mild or strong disgust or fear. Cerebral activation in response to these stimuli was contrasted with that for neutral faces. Results for fear generally confirmed previous positron emission tomography findings of amygdala involvement. Both strong and mild expressions of disgust activated anterior insular cortex but not the amygdala; strong disgust also activated structures linked to a limbic cortico-striatal-thalamic circuit. The anterior insula is known to be involved in responses to offensive tastes. The neural response to facial expressions of disgust in others is thus closely related to appraisal of distasteful stimuli.",nan; HUMAN AMYGDALA; MACAQUE MONKEY; ORGANIZATION; CORTEX; RECOGNITION; PERCEPTION; EMOTIONS; NEURONS; STIMULI; DAMAGE

While it is known that primates have a complex array of 10 or more somatosensory areas that contribute to the analysis of sensory information from the hand, less is known about what cortical areas are involved in processing information from receptors of the tongue and teeth. The tongue contains taste receptors, as well as mechanoreceptors. Afferents from taste receptors and mechanoreceptors of the tongue access different ascending systems in the brainstem. However, it is uncertain how these two sources of information are processed in cortex. Here the parts of somatosensory areas 3b, 3a, and presumptive 1 that represent the mechanoreceptors of the teeth and tongue are identified, and evidence is presented that the representations of the tongue also get information from the taste nucleus of the thalamus, VPMpc. As areas 3b, 3a, and 1 project to other areas of somatosensory cortex, and those areas to additional areas, some or all of the currently defined somatosensory areas of cortex may be involved in processing gustatory, as well as tactile, information from the tongue and thus have a role in the biologically important function of evaluating food in the mouth.

However, during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, when cortical activity is dominated by acetylcholine, the ACC is activated but DLPFC is suppressed. Using pathway tracing and electron microscopy in nonhuman primates (Macaca mulatta), we tested the hypothesis that the opposite states may reflect specific modulation by acetylcholine through strategic synaptic localization of muscarinic m2 receptors, which inhibit neurotransmitter release presynaptically, but are thought to be excitatory postsynaptically. In the ACC pathway to DLPFC (area 32 to area 9), m2 receptors predominated in ACC axon terminals and in more than half of the targeted dendrites of presumed inhibitory neurons, suggesting inhibitory cholinergic influence. In contrast, in a pathway linking the DLPFC area 46 to DLPFC area 9, postsynaptic m2 receptors predominated in targeted spines of presumed excitatory neurons, consistent with their mutual activation in working memory. These novel findings suggest that presynaptic and postsynaptic specificity of m2 cholinergic receptors may help explain the differential engagement of ACC and DLPFC areas in REM sleep for memory consolidation and synergism in awake states for cognitive control.",nan; MUSCARINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTOR; THALAMIC RETICULAR NUCLEUS; SLEEP-WAKE CYCLE; BASAL FOREBRAIN; FRONTAL-CORTEX; GABAERGIC INTERNEURONS; CORTICAL ACETYLCHOLINE; PRESYNAPTIC INHIBITION; COGNITIVE FUNCTIONS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX

At the global brain level, the human MTL has been described as part of the default mode network and amygdala nuclei as parts of the salience network, with both networks collectively forming a large-scale brain system supporting allostatic-interoceptive functions. We hypothesized (i) that intrinsic functional connectivity of slow activity fluctuations would reveal human MTL subsystems locally extending to the amygdala; and (ii) that these extended local subsystems would be globally embedded in large-scale brain systems supporting allostatic-interoceptive functions. Capitalizing on resting-state fMRI data of three independent samples of cognitively healthy adults (one main and two replication samples: N = 101, 60, and 29, respectively), we analyzed the functional connectivity of fluctuating ongoing BOLD-activity within and outside the amygdala-MTL in a data-driven way using masked independent component and dual-regression analyses. We found that at the local level, MTL subsystems extend to the amygdala and are functionally organized along the longitudinal amygdala-MTL axis. These subsystems are characterized by consistent involvement of amygdala, hippocampus, and entorhinal cortex, but variable participation of perirhinal and parahippocampal regions. At the global level, amygdala-MTL subsystems selectively connect to salience, thalamic-brainstem, and default mode networks - the major cortical and subcortical components of the allostatic-interoceptive system.

Recordings of the activity of neurons in different parts of the striatum of primates show that they have the following properties: 1) neurons in much of the putamen, which receives inputs from the sensori-motor cortex, have activity related to movements; 2) neurons in the caudate nucleus, which receives from the association cortex, have activity related for example to environmental stimuli which signal preparation for or initiation of behavioral responses; 3) neurons in the tail of the caudate nucleus, which receives strongly from the inferior temporal visual cortex, respond when a patterned visual stimulus changes; 4) some neurons in the posterior ventral putamen, which receives from the inferior temporal visual cortex and the prefrontal cortex, respond in a visual short term memory task, delayed match to sample. The neurons responded in the delay period, or differentially to match and non-match stimuli. These neurons did not respond in an auditory delayed match to sample task, so that their activity was not related to movement per se, but was instead more closely related to visual inputs relevant to a memory task; 5) some neurons in the ventral striatum (including the nucleus accumbens), which receives from limbic structures such as the amygdala and hippocampus, respond to stimuli associated with reinforcement or to novel stimuli. It is concluded that there is considerable segregation of function within the striatum. It is suggested that there is an opportunity for inputs which originate from different parts of the cerebral cortex to interact, via a first stage of convergence in the striatum, and by a further stage of convergence on the dendrites of single neurons in the globus pallidus and substantia nigra; and that both these parts of the basal ganglia may learn associations between the different signals they receive. The result of this convergence and learning is that the basal ganglia provide a way for cortical areas far on in the hierarchy of information processing to become linked during motor learning to particular sequences of movements, and thus to be involved in the execution of motor programs.",nan; SHORT-TERM-MEMORY; BASAL GANGLIA; BEHAVING MONKEY; SINGLE-CELL; MACACA-FASCICULARIS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; TEMPORAL CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; EFFERENT CONNECTIONS; RECOGNITION MEMORY

Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured with positron emission tomography (PET) and H-2 O-15 in nine normal volunteers while performing one control and two reaching tasks. In all tasks, visual stimuli were presented on a head mounted display (HMD). A target board was placed in front of the subjects bearing six red light-emitting diodes (LEDs) aligned on a circle with a green LED at its center. The center green LED and one of the six red LEDs, randomly selected, were repeatedly switched on and off, alternatively. In the control task, subjects were instructed to gaze at the lit LED. In the two reaching tasks, the reaching with visual feedback (RwithF) task and the reaching without visual feedback (RwithoutF) task, they had to point to the lit red LED with their right index fingers. In the RwithF task, their right hands were visible on the HMD before touching the target, whereas in the RwithoutF task, they were not visible. For each subject, subtraction images of each reaching task minus the control and the RwithF task minus the RwithoutF task were calculated after transformation of PET images into the standard brain shape with an adjustable computerized brain atlas. These subtraction rCBF images were then averaged among the subjects, and significant changes of rCBF were identified. Significant increases in rCBF not only in the RwithF task minus control image but also in the RwithF task minus the RwithoutF task image were observed in the supramarginal cortex, the premotor cortex and the posterior cingulate cortex of the left hemisphere, the caudate nucleus and the thalamus of the right hemisphere, and the right cerebellum and vermis.

Magnetoencephalographic activity (MEG) was recorded in response to five stimulus conditions from 10 professional trumpet players and nine musically untrained control subjects. Somatosensory and auditory stimuli were presented alone or in combination. Our data suggest that musicians, in general, process multisensory stimuli differently to the control group. When stimulating the lip in professional trumpet players, a multimodal interaction (expressed as difference between the multimodal response and the sum of unimodal responses) in the corresponding somatosensory cortex showed a positive peak at 33 ms, which was not found in the control group. Conversely, the control group shows a significant interaction of opposite polarity around 60-80 ms. We suggest that training-induced reorganization in musicians leads to a qualitatively different way to process multisensory information.

Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was studied in neurologically intact subjects during the performance of attention-demanding, sentence processing tasks using positron emission tomography (PET). The results demonstrated significantly increased rCBF in a distributed set of cerebral regions during the detection of an adjective or a particular agent in a sentence, including anterior cingulate cortex, left inferior and middle frontal cortex, left inferior temporo-occipital cortex, posterolateral temporal cortex, left caudate, and left thalamus. We identified defects in this cerebral network by studying PD patients with two PET techniques. Resting PET studies revealed a significant correlation between regional cerebral glucose metabolism in anterior cingulate cortex and deficits in attending to subtle grammatical aspects of sentences. Studies of PO patients with the PET activation technique revealed little change in anterior cingulate and left frontal CBF during performance of the adjective detection or agent detection tasks.

Positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) have recently demonstrated a number of cerebral and brain stem loci responding to cutaneous noxious stimuli. However, intersubject variability, both in the frequency and increased or decreased intensity of the responses, has caused uncertainty as to their significance. Nevertheless, the large number of available imaging studies have shown that;many areas with recognized functions are frequently affected by painful stimuli. With this evidence and recent developments in tracing central nervous system connections between areas responding to noxious stimuli, it is possible to identify nociceptive pathways that are within, or contribute to, afferent spinothalamo-cortical sensory and efferent skeletomotor and autonomic motor systems. In this study it is proposed that cortical and nuclear mechanisms for pain perception and response are hierarchically arranged with the prefrontal cortex at its highest level. Nevertheless, all components make particular contributions without which certain nociceptive failures can occur, as in pathological pain arising in some cases of nervous system injury.",nan; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; HUMAN CINGULATE CORTEX; VENTRALIS CAUDALIS RESPOND; RHESUS-MONKEY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; CORTICAL PROJECTIONS; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; FRONTAL-LOBE; HUMAN-BRAIN

J. Neurophysiol. 83: 1019-1030, 2000. A fundamental feature of neural circuitry in the primary visual cortex (V1) is the existence of recurrent excitatory connections between spiny neurons, recurrent inhibitory connections between smooth neurons, and local connections between excitatory and inhibitory neurons. We modeled the dynamic behavior of intermixed excitatory and inhibitory populations of cells in V1 that receive input from the classical receptive field (the receptive field center) through feedforward thalamocortical afferents, as well as input from outside the classical:receptive field (the receptive field surround) via long-range intracortical connections. A counterintuitive result is that the response of oriented cells can be facilitated beyond optimal levels when the surround stimulus is cross-oriented with respect to the center and suppressed when the surround stimulus is iso-oriented. This effect is primarily due to changes in recurrent inhibition within a local circuit. Cross-oriented surround stimulation leads to a reduction of presynaptic inhibition and a supraoptimal response, whereas iso-oriented surround stimulation has the opposite effect. This mechanism is used to explain the orientation and contrast dependence of contextual interactions in primary visual cortex: responses to a center stimulus can be both strongly suppressed and supraoptimally facilitated as a function of surround orientation, and these effects diminish as stimulus contrast decreases.",nan; SPINY STELLATE NEURONS; CATS STRIATE CORTEX; HORIZONTAL CONNECTIONS; PYRAMIDAL CELLS; INTRINSIC CONNECTIONS; LATERAL INTERACTIONS; MACAQUE MONKEY; SELECTIVITY; MECHANISMS; NEOCORTEX

Our goal was to determine if any brain regions are differentially activated by the attentional demands of these two search modes. We used fMRI to examine activation patterns during search for a target among a radial array of several distractors that were manipulated to produce efficient or inefficient search. Distractors for inefficient search were either uniform or varied to manipulate difficulty due to perceptual priming. No brain regions were uniquely activated by efficient or inefficient search, although inefficient search generally produced greater activations. The main differences were found in clusters in the superior occipital and superior parietal regions, for which activations were substantially greater for inefficient search. Similar results were found for frontal regions, such as the inferior prefrontal, superior frontal, anterior insula, and supplementary eye field, as well as the right ventral lateral thalamus. For inefficient search, increasing task difficulty resulted in low accuracy, but no difference in RT or activations. A working memory task utilizing the same display and response mode, but not involving search, activated the same frontal-parietal network as inefficient search (more so for the more difficult inefficient condition). Thus, our results identify brain regions that are more heavily recruited under conditions of inefficient search, independent of task difficultly per se, probably due in part to attentional modulation involving demands of eye movements, working memory, and top-down controls, but do not reveal independent networks related to efficient and inefficient search.

Traumatic brain injury triggers chronic microglial activation, but it is unclear whether this is harmful or beneficial. A successful chronic-phase treatment for traumatic brain injury might be to target microglia. In experimental models, the antibiotic minocycline inhibits microglial activation. We investigated the effect of minocycline on microglial activation and neurodegeneration using PET, MRI, and measurement of the axonal protein neurofilament light in plasma. Microglial activation was assessed using C-11-PBR28 PET. The relationships of microglial activation to measures of brain injury, and the effects of minocycline on disease progression, were assessed using structural and diffusion MRI, plasma neurofilament light, and cognitive assessment. Fifteen patients at least 6 months after a moderate-to-severe traumatic brain injury received either minocycline 100 mg orally twice daily or no drug, for 12 weeks. At baseline, C-11-PBR28 binding in patients was increased compared to controls in cerebral white matter and thalamus, and plasma neurofilament light levels were elevated. MRI measures of white matter damage were highest in areas of greater C-11-PBR28 binding. Minocycline reduced 11 C-PBR28 binding (mean Delta white matter binding = -23.30%, 95% confidence interval -40.9 to -5.64%, P = 0.018), but increased plasma neurofilament light levels. Faster rates of brain atrophy were found in patients with higher baseline neurofilament light levels. In this experimental medicine study, minocycline after traumatic brain injury reduced chronic microglial activation while increasing a marker of neurodegeneration.

Mice were inoculated intramuscularly with several BV isolates. Comparisons were based upon the doses required to produce infection (ID50), non-central nervous system (CNS) clinical disease (CS50), CNS disease (CNSD50) and lethal effect (LD50). Strains differed in respect of the dose required to produce clinical disease in BALB/c mice. C57BL/6 mice were more resistant than BALB/c mice to CNS disease. Skin lesions at the inoculation site consisted of epidermal necrosis, ulceration, serocellular crusts and underlying dermatitis. CNS lesions included marked inflammation in the ipsilateral dorsal root ganglion and lumbar spinal cord (point. of viral entry). The distribution of the lumbar spinal cord lesions suggested viral entry via sensory afferent neurons, ventral motor tracts, or both. The lesions in the more cranial spinal cord segments suggested ascension to the brain via bilateral spinothalamic and spinoreticular tracts. Brain lesions included encephalitis with neuronal necrosis and white matter destruction located consistently at the base of the brainstem, the reticular system, and rostrally to the thalamus and hypothalamus. Viral antigen was detected immunohistochemically in the lesions. The results indicated an ascending encephalomyelitis syndrome similar to that produced by BV in mail. (c) 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Accordingly, taste is organized along a neural dimension of nutrients versus toxins, which corresponds to a behavioral dimension of acceptance versus rejection, and to a hedonic dimension of appetitive versus aversive qualities. Reflexive responses; cognitive analyses, and hedonic reactions appear to be managed at different levels of the nervous system. At the first central relay, the nucleus of the solitary tract, somatic reflexes for acceptance or rejection, and autonomic reflexes anticipating digestion are orchestrated. At the second, the parabrachial nucleus of the rodent, associative mechanisms important to the development of conditioned aversions and sodium appetite are manifested. In the thalamic taste relay, gustatory memories associated with non-visceral events may be formed. Primary taste cortex appears to be the site for a cognitive evaluation of gustatory quality and intensity. Finally, a hedonic assessment of the chemical may be made in secondary taste cortex and in the ventral forebrain sites to which it projects. With this assessment comes integration of the gustatory signal with those from other senses, perhaps to create a perception of flavor. Therefore, a sequence that begins with an analysis of the molecular structure of a chemical in the mouth serves to incorporate that gustatory component into an appreciation of flavor, and to participate in the control of motivational processes that guide dietary selection.

Although many of these brain areas are highly interconnected and are engaged in multiple processing roles, each area has been typically considered in isolation. Accordingly, little attention has been given to the global functional organization of brain mechanisms mediating pain processing. In the present investigation, we have combined positron emission tomography with psychophysical assessment of graded painful stimuli to better characterize the multiregional organization of supraspinal pain processing mechanisms and to identify a brain mechanism subserving the processing of pain intensity. Multiple regression analysis revealed statistically reliable relationships between perceived pain intensity and activation of a functionally diverse group of brain regions, including those important in sensation, motor control, affect, and attention. Pain intensity-related activation occurred bilaterally in the cerebellum, putamen, thalamus, insula, anterior cingulate cortex, and secondary somatosensory cortex, contralaterally in the primary somatosensory cortex and supplementary motor area, and ipsilaterally in the ventral premotor area. These results confirm the existence of a highly distributed, bilateral supraspinal mechanism engaged in the processing of pain intensity. The conservation of pain intensity information across multiple, functionally distinct brain areas contrasts sharply with traditional views that sensory-discriminative processing of pain is confined within the somatosensory cortex and can account for the preservation of conscious awareness of pain intensity after extensive cerebral cortical lesions.",nan; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; CINGULATE CORTEX; NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS; AUTOMATED ALGORITHM; WORKING-MEMORY; RHESUS-MONKEY; AREA; PET; PERCEPTION; SPACE

The primate PPC shows functional differentiation such that dorsal areas are implicated in top-down, controlled attention, and ventral areas are implicated in bottom-up, stimulus-driven attention. Whether the rat PPC also shows such functional differentiation is unknown. Here, we address this open question using functional neuroanatomy and in vivo electrophysiology. Using conventional tract-tracing methods, we examined connectivity with other structures implicated in visuospatial attention including the lateral posterior nucleus of the thalamus (LPn) and the postrhinal cortex (POR). We showed that the LPn projects to the entire PPC, preferentially targeting more ventral areas. All parts of the PPC and POR are reciprocally connected with the strongest connections evident between ventral PPC and caudal POR. Next, we simultaneously recorded neuronal activity in dorsal and ventral PPC as rats performed a visuospatial attention (VSA ) task that engages in both bottom-up and top-down attention. Previously, we provided evidence that the dorsal PPC is engaged in multiple cognitive process including controlled attention (). Here, we further showed that ventral PPC cells respond to stimulus onset more rapidly than dorsal PPC cells, providing evidence for a role in stimulus-driven, bottom-up attention.",action; default mode network; navigation; perception; postrhinal cortex; SINGLE NEURON ACTIVITY; ENTORHINAL CORTICES; POSTRHINAL CORTICES; PARAHIPPOCAMPAL CORTICES; SUBCORTICAL CONNECTIONS; PULVINAR NUCLEUS; CINGULATE CORTEX; THETA MODULATION; REFERENCE FRAMES; RHESUS-MONKEY

The anterior commissure, a fiber tract whose axons in primates primarily connect the two temporal lobes, was an average of 12%, or 1.17 mm2 larger in females than in males. The massa intermedia, a structure that crosses the third ventricle between the two thalami, was present in 78% of the females and 68% of the males.

These sex differences were present despite the fact that the brains of males were larger than those of females.

In order to translate basic scientific results from rodents to the human setting a large animal model is needed to thoroughly study the effect of such therapeutic interventions. The aim of the study was, accordingly, to describe the basic anatomy of the Gottingen minipig NAcc and its retrograde connections. Tracing was carried out by MRI-guided stereotactic unilateral fluorogold injections in the NAcc of Gottingen minipigs. After 2 weeks the brains were sectioned and subsequently stained with Nissl-, autometallographic (AMG) development of myelin, and DARPP-32 and calbindin immunohistochemistry. The minipig NAcc was divided in a central core and an outer medial, ventral and lateral shell. We confirmed the NAcc to be a large and well-segregated structure toward its medial, ventral and lateral borders. The fluorogold tracing revealed inputs to NAcc from the medial parts of the prefrontal cortex, BA 25 (subgenual cortex), insula bilaterally, amygdala, the CA1-region of hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, subiculum, paraventricular and anterior parts of thalamus, dorsomedial parts of hypothalamus, substantia nigra, ventral tegmental area (VTA), the retrorubral field and the dorsal and median raphe nuclei.

Methods-Forty-one patients participating in an inpatient stroke rehabilitation database, admitted 17+/-2 (SEM) days after initial unilateral hemispheric ischemic stroke, with neuroimaging studies performed >48 hours after stroke and with minimal upper limb (UL) movement (admission Fugl-Meyer UL motor scores less than or equal to9; normal score, 58) were studied. Patients were divided into 3 groups according to their UL discharge Fugl-Meyer score: 0 to 9, no/poor recovery; 10 to 18, well-defined flexion-extension synergies; and >18, synergies + isolated movements. Lesions affecting the following structures were recorded: primary motor cortex, premotor area, supplementary motor area, anterior half of the middle third of corona radiata (secondary motor efferents), posterior half of the middle third of corona radiata (primary motor efferents), genu, anterior and posterior limbs of the internal capsule (PLIC), basal ganglia, and thalamus. chi (2) Analysis and ANOVA were used to study the significance of stroke location on UL motor recovery. Results-The effect of involvement of primary, premotor, or supplementary motor areas on motor recovery did not reach statistical significance. Patients with purely cortical stroke were likely to recover UL isolated movement (3 of 4) compared with purely subcortical (1 of 17) or mixed cortical-subcortical stroke location (2 of 20) (P=0.009). Of those with cortical, subcortical, or mixed cortical plus subcortical lesions sparing the PLIC, 5 of 13 recovered isolated UL movement (P=0.01). Only 1 of 28 patients with involvement of the PLIC plus adjacent corona radiata, basal ganglia, or thalamus recovered isolated UL movement (P=0.01). Patients with small lacunar strokes affecting only the PLIC did not have sufficient motor deficits 2 weeks after stroke to meet inclusion criteria. Conclusions-The probability of recovery of isolated UL movement decreases progressively with lesion location as follows: cortex, corona radiata, and PLIC. This is consistent with our current understanding of redundant cortical motor representation and convergence of corticofugal motor efferents as they pass through the corona radiata to the PLIC.",hemiplegia; prognosis; rehabilitation; stroke outcome; INDUCED MOVEMENT THERAPY; PREMOTOR CORTEX; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; REHABILITATION; STIMULATION; PLASTICITY; ACTIVATION; INFARCTION; AREAS

To explore this issue, I measured, during conditions of spatial or feature-based attention, activity in the human subcortical visual nuclei, which have precise retinotopic maps and are known to play important roles in the regulation of spatial attention but have limited selectivity of nonspatial features. Subjects attended to and detected changes in separate fields of moving or colored dots. When the fields were disjoint, spatially attending to one field enhanced hemodynamic responses in the superior colliculus (SC), lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), and two retinotopic pulvinar nuclei. When the two dot fields were spatially overlapping, feature-based attention to the moving versus colored dots enhanced responses in the pulvinar nuclei and the majority of the LGN, including the magnocellular layers, and suppressed activity in some areas within the parvocellular layers; the SC was inconsistently modulated among subjects. The results demonstrate that feature-based attention operates throughout the visual system by prioritizing neurons encoding the attended information, including broadly tuned thalamic neurons. I conclude that spatial and feature-based attention operate via a common principle, but that spatial location is a special feature in that it is widely encoded in the brain, is used for overt orienting, and uses a specialized structure, the SC.",nan; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; HUMAN VISUAL-CORTEX; MONKEY SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; ALERT RHESUS-MONKEY; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; RETINOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; SINGLE NEURONS; HUMAN PULVINAR; AREA V4; COMPETITIVE SELECTION

The patients had previously undergone bilateral STN deep brain stimulation (DBS) and subsequently received unilateral DBS electrodes in the PPNR. Evoked potentials were recorded from the local field potentials (LFP) from the PPNR with STN stimulation at different frequencies and bipolar contacts. Ipsilateral and contralateral short latency (<2 ms) PPNR responses were evoked from left but not from right STN stimulation. In both patients, STN stimulation evoked contralateral PPNR responses at medium latencies between 41 and 45 ms. Cortical evoked potentials to single pulse STN stimulation were observed at latencies between 18 and 27 ms. These results demonstrate a functional connection between the STN and the PPNR It likely involves direct projections between the STN and PPNR or polysynaptic pathways with thalamic or cortical relays.

Positron emission tomography, which has previously identified resting state blood flow abnormalities in depression, was used to investigate neural activity associated with performance of this task in depressed patients and normal controls. Methods. Six patients with unipolar depression and six matched controls were scanned while performing easy and hard Tower of London problems in a one-touch computerized paradigm and while performing a perceptuomotor control task. Results, The patients in this study showed an expected task-related performance deficit compared with normal subjects. In normal subjects, the task engaged a network of prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate, posterior cortical areas and subcortical structures including the striatum, thalamus and cerebellum. Depressed patients failed to show significant activation in the cingulate and striatum; activation in the other prefrontal and posterior cortical regions was significantly attenuated relative to controls. Crucially, patients also failed to show the normal augmentation of activation in the caudate nucleus, anterior cingulate and right prefrontal cortex associated with increasing task difficulty. Conclusions, These findings provide evidence for cingulate, prefrontal and striatal dysfunction associated with impaired task performance in depression. The present results are consistent with a central role of cingulate dysfunction in depression as well as suggesting impaired frontostriatal function.",nan; CEREBRAL BLOOD-FLOW; SPATIAL WORKING-MEMORY; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; FRONTAL-LOBE; MAJOR DEPRESSION; COGNITIVE-PROCESSES; CINGULATE CORTEX; BRAIN ACTIVITY; BASAL GANGLIA; RHESUS-MONKEY

The insula has a dynamic cytoarchitectonic arrangement throughout its length. The anterior insula is comprised of an agranular-allocortical area which functionally is part of the paralimbic belt. Its cortical connections are predominantly with other allocortical areas. Subcortical, limbic, and brain stem connections underscore the anterior insula's role in processing and integrating autonomic and visceral information, The posterior insula is comprised of a granular-isocortical area which functionally is linked to somatomotor systems. Its cortical connections are predominantly with other neocortical areas. Insular-cortical and sub-cortical connections, especially with the thalamus and basal ganglia, underscore the posterior insula's role in somatosensory, vestibular, and motor integration. The dysgranular insula lying in between the anterior and posterior insula represents an anatomical and functional transition between these regions. The predominant flow of intra-insular projections from anterior to more posterior regions suggests that the posterior insula also serves as an integrative heteromodal association area for information received by all five senses. The insula plays a role in cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, vestibular, olfactory, gustatory, visual, auditory, somatosensory, and motor modulation. It is also felt to play a role in conditioned aversive learning, affective and motivational components of pain perception, stress induced immunosuppression, mood stability, sleep, and language. Clinical correlation of damage to the insula, and the resultant impairment of the above functions is discussed.",nan; OLD-WORLD MONKEY; CONDITIONED TASTE-AVERSION; CORTEX LESIONS; RHESUS-MONKEY; CONDUCTION APHASIA; SOLITARY TRACT; RAT; NUCLEUS; CONNECTIONS; NEURONS

Findings from this study in rats suggest that for androgens, this influence may include stimulation of underlying corticocortical connections. First, immunoreactivity for intracellular androgen receptors, while present in all regions and layers examined, was found to be particularly abundant in sensory and motor regions, and within these, within their major pyramidal cell layers, i.e. layers II/III and V/VI. Double labeling immunocytochemical studies for androgen receptors and for neuron-specific markers then confirmed that the majority of receptor-bearing cortical cells were pyramidal neurons. Finally, combined analyses of cortical receptor immunoreactivity and retrograde labeling produced by tracer injections made in specific subcortical (caudate, nucleus accumbens, superior colliculus, thalamus) areas yielded only isolated examples of receptor/tracer overlap. However, injections made within the cortex itself (sensory, motor, associational areas) retrogradely labeled cortical cells some 50% or more - especially within injected hemispheres, were receptor-immunoreactive. Thus, the regional, laminar, and cellular distributions of immunoreactivity in the rat cerebrum largely identify pyramidal neurons with connectional signatures aligning intracellular androgen receptors with the local, associational, and to a lesser degree, callosal circuits that interlink territories of the cortical mantle and play key roles in cortical information processing.",estrogen; gonadal hormones; intracellular receptors; neocortex; pyramidal neurons; testosterone; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; ESTROGEN-RECEPTOR; VISUAL-CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODIES; CELLULAR-DISTRIBUTION; TYROSINE-HYDROXYLASE; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX

Experiments in macaque monkeys show that these two kinds of impairment are functionally similar to each other. After any lesion that interrupts the Delay-Brion system (hippocampus, fornix, mamillary bodies and anterior thalamus) monkeys are impaired in scene-specific memory where an event takes place against a background that is specific to that event. Scene-specific memory in the monkey corresponds to human episodic memory, which is the memory of a unique event set in a particular scene, as opposed to scene-independent human knowledge, which is abstracted from many different scenes. However interruption of the Delay-Brion system is not sufficient to explain all of the memory impairments that are seen in amnesic patients. To explain amnesia the specialized function of the hippocampus in scene memory needs to be considered alongside the other, qualitatively different functional specializations of other memory systems of the temporal lobe, including the perirhinal cortex and the amygdala. In all these specialized areas, however, including the hippocampus, there is no fundamental distinction between memory systems and perceptual systems. In explaining memory disorders in amnesia it is also important to consider them alongside the memory disorders of neglect patients. Neglect patients fail to represent in memory the side of the world that is contralateral to the current fixation point, in both short-and long-term memory retrieval. Neglect was produced experimentally by unilateral visual disconnection in the monkey, confirming the idea that visual memory retrieval is retinotopically organized; patients with unilateral medial temporal-lobe removals showed lateralized memory impairments for half-scenes in the visual hemifield contralateral to the removal. Thus, in scene-memory retrieval the Delay-Brion system contributes to the retrieval of visual memories into the retinotopically organized visual cortex. This scene memory interpretation of hippocampal function needs to be contrasted with the cognitive-map hypothesis. The cognitive-map model of hippocampal function shares some common assumptions with the Hebb-synapse model of association formation, and the Hebb-synapse model can be rejected on the basis of recent evidence that monkeys can form direct associations in memory between temporally discontiguous events. Our general conclusion is that the primate brain encompasses widespread and powerful memory mechanisms which will continue to be poorly understood if theory and experimentation continue to concentrate too much, as they have in the past, on the hippocampus and the Hebb synapse.",nan; RHINAL CORTEX ABLATIONS; FORNIX TRANSECTION; RHESUS-MONKEYS; MEMORY IMPAIRMENT; RECOGNITION MEMORY; PERIRHINAL CORTEX; TEMPORAL-LOBE; OBJECTS; AMYGDALECTOMY; HIPPOCAMPUS

The dominant retinogeniculostriate pathway has been an area of extensive study, and Vivien Casagrande's work in examining the once overlooked koniocellular pathway of the lateral geniculate nucleus has generated interest in how alternate subcortical pathways can contribute to visual perception. Another subcortical visual relay center is the inferior pulvinar (PI), which has four subdivisions and numerous connections with other subcortical and cortical areas and is directly recipient of retinal afferents. The complexity of subcortical connections associated with the PI subdivisions has led to differing results from various groups. A particular challenge in determining the exact connectivity pattern has been in accurately targeting the subdivisions of the PI with neural tracers. Therefore, in the present study, we used a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided stereotaxic injection system to inject bidirectional tracers in the separate subdivisions of the PI, the superior layers of the superior colliculus, the retina, and the lateral geniculate nucleus. Our results have determined for the first time that the medial inferior pulvinar (PIm) is innervated by widefield retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), and this pathway is not a collateral branch of the geniculate and collicular projecting RGCs. Furthermore, our tracing data shows no evidence of collicular terminations in the PIm, which are confined to the centromedial and posterior PI.",marmoset; neural tracing; retina; superior colliculus; thalamus; vision; RRID: AB_10000347; RRID: AB_221544; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; THORNY GANGLION-CELLS; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; MACAQUE MONKEY; STRIATE CORTEX; TREE SHREW; NEW-WORLD; NEUROCHEMICAL ORGANIZATION; ARCHITECTONIC SUBDIVISIONS

Domoic acid-induced convulsions affects Limbic structures such as hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, and different anatomic markers can detect these neurotoxic effects to varying degrees, Here we report effects of domoic acid administration on quantitative indicators of brain metabolism and gliosis. Domoic acid, 2.25 mg/kg i.p., caused stereotyped behavior and convulsions in approximately 60% of rats which received it. Six to eight days after domoic acid or vehicle administration, the animals were processed to measure regional brain incorporation of the long-chain fatty acids [1-C-14]arachidonic acid ([C-14]AA) and [9,10-H-3]palmitic acid ([H-3]PA), or regional cerebral glucose utilization (rCMR(glc)) using 2-[1-C-14]deoxy-D-glucose, by quantitative autoradiography. Others rats were processed to measure brain glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Domoic acid increased GFAP in the anterior portion of cerebral cortex, the caudate putamen and thalamus compared with vehicle. However, in rats that convulsed after domoic acid GFAP was significantly increased throughout the cerebral cortex, as well as in the hippocampus, septum, caudate putamen, and thalamus. Domoic acid, in the absence of convulsions, decreased relative [C-14]AA incorporation in the claustrum and pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus compared with vehicle-injected controls, In the presence of convulsions, relative [C-14]AA incorporation was decreased in hippocampus regions CAl and CA2. Uptake of [H-3]PA into brain was unaffected. Relative rCMR(glc) decreased in entorhinal cortex following domoic acid administration with or without convulsions. These results suggest that acute domoic acid exposure affects discrete brain circuits by inducing convulsions, and that domoic acid-induced convulsions cause chronic effects on brain function that are reflected in altered fatty acid metabolism and gliosis.

In this study, the functional anatomy of cognitive planning was investigated further, using positron emission tomography (PET). Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured in 12 normal volunteers while performing easy and difficult versions of (i) a modified Tower of London planning task; (ii) a mnemonic Variant of this task that required short-term retention and reproduction of problem solutions; and (iii) a control condition that involved identical visual stimuli and motor responses. Significant increases in rCBF were observed in the left hemisphere, in both the mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex and in the head of the caudate nucleus, when the difficult planning task was compared with the control condition. Moreover, subtraction of a simple planning condition from the more difficult one revealed focal increases in rCBF in the caudate nucleus and the thalamus only. During both mnemonic variants of the planning task, changes were also observed in the mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex and in more ventral frontopolar regions, bilaterally. When compared directly, the planning and memory conditions differed in terms of these ventral activation foci, but not in the pattern of activation observed in the mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex. These findings further implicate frontostriatal circuitry in high-level planning and provide evidence for functionally distinct contributions from ventral and dorsolateral frontal regions to spatial working memory.",frontal cortex; striatum; caudate nucleus; Parkinson's disease; humans; RHESUS-MONKEY; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; FRONTAL-CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL ACTIVATION; CORTICAL PROJECTIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; LOBE LESIONS; BLOOD-FLOW; LOCALIZATION; PERFORMANCE

Disturbances of the fronto-striatal-thalamic pathways responsible for motor control and impulse inhibition have been previously described in other studies. Although differences in motor performance are well recognized, imaging data elucidating the neuronal correlates are scarce. Here, we examined 19 adult TS patients (13 men, aged 22-52 years, mean = 34.3 years) and 18 age-and sex-matched controls (13 men, aged 24-57 years, mean = 37.6 years) in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study at 1.5 T. We corrected for possible confounds introduced by tics, motion, and brain-structural differences as well as age, sex, comorbidities, and medication. Patients and controls were asked to perform a sequential finger-tapping task using their right, left, and both hands, respectively. Task performance was monitored by simultaneous MR-compatible video recording. Although behavioral data obtained during scanning did not show significant differences across groups, we observed differential neuronal activation patterns depending on both handedness (dominant vs. nondominant) and tapping frequency in frontal, parietal, and subcortical areas. When controlling for open motor performance, a failure of deactivation in easier task conditions was found in the subgenual cingulate cortex in the TS patients. In addition, performance-related functional connectivity of lower-and higher-order motor networks differed between patients and controls. In summary, although open performance was comparable, patients showed different neuronal networks and connectivity patterns when performing increasingly demanding tasks, further illustrating the impact of the disease on the motor system.

Activations were seen in the cortical and subcortical components of a previously characterized attentional network, namely, the frontal eye fields, posterior parietal cortex, the cingulate gyrus, the putamen, and the thalamus, Additional activations occurred in the anterior insula, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, temporo-occipital cortex in the middle and inferior temporal gyri, the supplementary motor area, and the cerebellum. Direct comparisons showed a nearly complete overlap in the location of activations resulting from the two tasks. However, the spatial priming task displayed a more pronounced rightward asymmetry of parietal activation, and a conjunction analysis showed that the area of posterior parietal cortex jointly activated by both tasks was more extensive in the right hemisphere. Furthermore, the posterior parietal and temporo-occipital activations were more pronounced in the task of endogenous attentional shifts. The results show that both exogenous (based on spatial priming) and endogenous (based on expectancy cueing) shifts of attention are subserved by a common network of cortical and subcortical regions. However, the differences between the two tasks, especially in the degree of rightward asymmetry, suggests that the pattern of activation within this network may show variations that reflect the specific attributes of the attentional task.

Here, by delivering intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) to the supplementary eye fields (SEF) of monkeys performing interleaved pro- and anti-saccades, we show a surprising diversity of state-dependent effects of ICMS-SEF. Short-duration ICMS-SEF passed around cue presentation selectively disrupted anti-saccades by increasing reaction times and error rates bilaterally, and also recruited neck muscles, favoring contralateral head turning to a greater degree on anti-saccade trials. These results are consistent with the functional relevance of the SEF for anti-saccades. The multiplicity of stimulation-evoked effects, with ICMS-SEF simultaneously disrupting anti-saccade performance and facilitating contralateral head orienting, probably reflects both the diversity of cortical and subcortical targets of SEF projections, and the response of this oculomotor network to stimulation. We speculate that the bilateral disruption of anti-saccades arises via feedback loops that may include the thalamus, whereas neck muscle recruitment arises via feedforward polysynaptic pathways to the motor periphery. Consideration of both sets of results reveals a more complete picture of the highly complex and multiphasic response to ICMS-SEF that can play out differently in different effector systems.",context; eye movements; frontal cortex; monkey; orienting; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; NECK MUSCLE RESPONSES; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; TURNING SYNERGY; FRONTAL-CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; GAZE SHIFTS

This estimate was based on the F-18-labeled 2-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) uptake measured by means of positron emission tomography and compared, using statistical parametric mapping (SPM99), with that of six control subjects. The contrast [CH children - Controls] showed that CH children had two loci of relatively higher FDG uptake. The larger voxel cluster was found in the ipsilesional hemisphere and comprised the primary motor and somatosensory cortices and left inferior parietal lobule. The other cluster was located in the contralesional hemisphere and encompassed the primary motor cortex, callosomarginal sulcus, and cingulate gyrus. The reverse contrast [Controls - CH children] showed that control subjects had a relatively higher FDG uptake bilaterally in the temporal and hippocampal gyri, the rostral part of the brain stem, the thalami, the putamen, and the superior frontal gyri. A crossed cerebellar diaschisis was not observed in CH children. This relatively higher FDG uptake in the ipsi- and contralesional motor areas of CH children stands out in contrast to the hypometabolism (diaschisis) frequently observed in adult stroke patients with a subcortical lesion. This increased FDG uptake in the disconnected ipsilesional motor areas may reflect a long-term adaptation leading, for example, to an increased synaptic density and/or activity or to a change in the density of glucose transporters.

The ventral capsule/ventral striatum and nucleus accumbens (NAc) region is a clinically approved target for deep brain stimulation for obsessive-compulsive disorder. METHODS: We performed a comprehensive literature review to define clinically relevant anatomy and connectivity of the ventral capsule/ventral striatum and NAc region to guide target selection for deep brain stimulation. RESULTS: Architecturally and functionally, the NAc is divided into the core and the shell, with each area having different connections. The shell primarily receives limbic information, and the core typically receives information from the motor system. In general, afferents from the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala are excitatory. The dopaminergic projections to the NAc from the ventral tegmental area modulate the balance of these excitatory inputs. Several important inputs to the NAc converge at the junction of the internal capsule (IC) and the anterior commissure (AC): the ventral amygdalofugal pathways that run parallel to and underneath the AC, the precommissural fornical fibers that run anterior to the AC, axons from the ventral prefrontal cortex and medial orbitofrontal cortex that occupy the most ventral part of the IC and embedding within the NAc and AC, and the superolateral branch of the medial forebrain bundle located parallel to the anterior thalamic radiation in the IC. CONCLUSIONS: The caudal part of the NAc passing through the IC-AC junction may be an effective target for deep brain stimulation to improve behavioral symptoms associated with obsessive-compulsive disorder.",Anterior commissure; Deep brain stimulation; Internal capsule; Nucleus accumbens; Obsessive-compulsive disorder; Reward circuitry; Ventral striatum; MEDIAL FOREBRAIN-BUNDLE; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; EFFERENT PROJECTIONS; INTERNAL CAPSULE; BED NUCLEUS; COMPARTMENTAL ORGANIZATION; HIPPOCAMPAL-FORMATION; ANTERIOR COMMISSURE; RHESUS-MONKEY; RAT

The present study explores the link between endogenous dynamics of functional connectivity and autonomic state in an eyes-closed resting condition. Using a sliding window analysis on resting state fMRI data from 35 young, healthy male subjects, we examined how heart rate variability (HRV) covaries with temporal changes in whole-brain functional connectivity with seed regions previously described to mediate effects of vigilance and arousal (amygdala and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex: dACC). We identified a set of regions, including brainstem, thalamus, putamen, and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, that became more strongly coupled with the dACC and amygdala seeds during states of elevated HRV. Effects differed between high and low frequency components of HRV, suggesting specific contributions of parasympathetic and sympathetic tone on individual connections. Furthermore, dynamics of functional connectivity could be separated from those primarily related to BOLD signal fluctuations. The present results contribute novel information about the neural basis of transient changes of autonomic nervous system states, and suggest physiological and psychological components of the recently observed non-stationarity in resting state functional connectivity.

As a result, the functional roles of these subdivisions in humans have not been investigated physiologically. To functionally map the M and P subdivisions of human LGN, we used high-resolution fMRI at high field (7 T and 3 T) together with a combination of spatial, temporal, luminance, and chromatic stimulus manipulations. We found that stimulus factors that differentially drive magnocellular and parvocellular neurons in primate LGN also elicit differential BOLD fMRI responses in human LGN and that these responses exhibit a spatial organization consistent with the known anatomical organization of the M and P subdivisions. In test-retest studies, the relative responses of individual voxels to M-type and P-type stimuli were reliable across scanning sessions on separate days and across sessions at different field strengths. The ability to functionally identify magnocellular and parvocellular regions of human LGN with fMRI opens possibilities for investigating the functions of these subdivisions in human visual perception, in patient populations with suspected abnormalities in one of these subdivisions, and in visual cortical processing streams arising from parallel thalamocortical pathways.

Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) is a fully automated image analysis technique allowing identification of regional differences in gray matter (GM) and white matter (WM) between groups of subjects without a prior region of interest. The purpose of this study was to determine whole-brain GM and WM changes in TLE and to investigate the relationship between these abnormalities and clinical parameters. We studied 85 patients with pharmacologically intractable TLE and unilateral hippocampal atrophy and 47 age- and sex-matched healthy control subjects. The seizure focus was right sided in 40 patients and left sided in 45. Student's t test statistical maps of differences between patients' and controls' GM and WM concentrations were obtained using a general linear model. A further regression against duration of epilepsy, age of onset, presence of febrile convulsions, and secondary generalized seizures was performed with the TLE population. Voxel-based morphometry revealed that GM pathology in TLE extends beyond the hippocampus involving other limbic areas such as the cingulum and the thalamus, as well as extralimbic areas, particularly the frontal lobe. White matter reduction was found only ipsilateral to the seizure focus, including the temporopolar, entorhinal, and perirhinal areas. This pattern of structural changes is suggestive of disconnection involving preferentially frontolimbic pathways in patients with pharmacologically intractable TLE. (C) 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Both mechanisms are related to a system for control and modulation of visceral function stretching from the spinal cord to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, including the ventral striatum, ventral pallidum, and mediodorsal thalamus, the amygdala, the hypothalamus, the periaqueductal gray (PAG), and the brainstem reticular formation and autonomic nuclei. Reflexes at the lower levels provide rapid visceral and somatic reactions to threatening stimuli, while the PAG and hypothalamus coordinate these to produce more concerted responses. The amygdala interacts with the cortical sensory systems in the assessment of fear-related stimuli and modulates the reflex responses through projections to the hypothalamus and brainstem. The ventromedial prefrontal cortex, especially the medial prefrontal network, is connected to the amygdala, hypothalamus, and PAG, and allows cortical control over the system in relation to a wider set of emotions. This cortical region is involved both in the assessment of reward and in mood disorders and it plays a central role in the ability to discern the consequences of one's actions and make appropriate behavioral choices. It also forms an interconnected circuit with specific cortical areas in the rostral superior temporal cortex, posterior parahippocampal cortex, and retrosplenial/posterior cingulate cortex. The overall function of this circuit is unclear, but may be involved in introspective monitoring of the individual.",amygdala; orbital cortex; medial prefrontal cortex; periaqueductal gray; hypothalamus; fear; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; CORTICAL AFFERENT CONNECTIONS; POSTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEYS; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; ARCHITECTONIC SUBDIVISION; AMYGDALOPETAL PROJECTIONS; EXCITOTOXIC LESIONS; MACACA-FASCICULARIS; MAJOR DEPRESSION

Optical densitometry values of reacted tissue were obtained for 50 different structures of the brain. In general, most structures reached adult levels of oxidative capacity by 30 days of age with some motor areas (e.g., cerebellum, red nucleus) exhibiting adult values as early as 7 days of age. Thereafter, some structures (e.g., basal ganglia, thalamus) exhibited levels of cytochrome oxidase activity that exceeded adult values for varying periods of time.

The majority of fibers that exit cerebellar cortex synapse in dentate nuclei (DN) before reaching extracerebellar structures such as cerebral cortex, but the functional neuroanatomy of human DN remains largely unmapped. Neuroimaging research has redefined broad categories of functional division in the human brain showing that primary processing, attentional (task positive) processing, and default-mode (task negative) processing are three central poles of neural macroscale functional organization. This broad spectrum of human neural processing categories is represented not only in the cerebral cortex, but also in the thalamus, striatum, and cerebellar cortex. Whether functional organization in DN obeys a similar set of macroscale divisions, and whether DN are yet another compartment of representation of a broad spectrum of human neural processing categories, remains unknown. Here, we show for the first time that human DN are optimally divided into three functional territories as indexed by high spatio-temporal resolution resting-state MRI in 77 healthy humans, and that these three distinct territories contribute uniquely to default-mode, salience-motor, and visual cerebral cortical networks.

We examined how signal transmission is regulated in the macaque LGN by recording the retinal input to a single LGN neuron while stimulating the receptive field center with a naturalistic luminance sequence. After extracting the EPSPs, which are often partially merged with spike waveforms, we found that > 95% of spikes were associated with an EPSP from a single retinal ganglion cell. Each spike within a  burst train was generated by an EPSP, indicating that LGN bursts are inherited from retinal bursts. LGN neurons rarely fired unless at least two EPSPs summated within 40 ms. This facilitation in EPSP efficacy was followed by depression. If a spike was generated by the first EPSP in a pair, it did not alter the efficacy of the second EPSP. Hence, the timing of EPSPs arising from the primary retinal driver governs synaptic efficacy and provides the basis for successful retinogeniculate transmission.",retinal ganglion cells; lateral geniculate nucleus; luminance; natural statistics; spike generation; S-potential; neural coding; T-type calcium current; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; RECEPTIVE-FIELD PROPERTIES; VISUAL INFORMATION; RELAY NEURONS; THALAMIC NEURONS; ACTION-POTENTIALS; CALCIUM CURRENTS; RESPONSE-MODES; NMDA RECEPTORS

Therefore, the differential effects of caloric vestibular stimulation (right or left ear irrigation with warm water at 44degreesC) on cortical and subcortical activation were studied in 12 right-handed and 12 left-handed healthy volunteers. Caloric irrigation induces a direction-specific sensation of rotation and nystagmus. Significant regional cerebral blood flow increases were found in a network within both hemispheres, including the superior frontal gyrus/sulcus, the precentral gyrus and the inferior parietal lobule with the supramarginal gyrus. These areas correspond best to the cortical ocular motor centres, namely the prefrontal cortex, the frontal eye field and the parietal eye field, known to be involved in the processing of caloric nystagmus. Furthermore, distinct temporo-parietal activations could be separated in the posterior part of the insula with the adjacent superior temporal gyrus, the inferior parietal lobule and precuneus. These areas fit best to the human homologues of multisensory vestibular cortex areas identified in the monkey and correspond to the parieto-insular vestibular cortex (PIVC), the visual temporal sylvian area (VTS) and areas 7 and 6. Further cortical activations were seen in the anterior insula, the inferior frontal gyrus and anterior cingulum. The subcortical activation pattern in the putamen, thalamus and midbrain is consistent with the organization of efferent ocular motor pathways. Cortical and subcortical activation of the described areas was bilateral during monaural stimulation, but predominant in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the stimulated ear and exhibited a significant right hemispheric dominance for vestibular and ocular motor structures in right-handed volunteers. Similarly, a significant left hemispheric dominance was found in the 12 left-handed volunteers. Thus, this PET study showed for the first time that cortical and subcortical activation by vestibular caloric stimulation depends (i) on the handedness of the subjects and (ii) on the side of the stimulated ear. Maximum activation was therefore found when the non-dominant hemisphere was ipsilateral to the stimulated ear, i.e. in the right hemisphere of right-handed subjects during caloric irrigation of the right ear and in the left hemisphere of left-handed subjects during caloric irrigation of the left ear. The localization of handedness and vestibular dominance in opposite hemispheres might conceivably indicate that the vestibular system and its hemispheric dominance, which matures earlier during ontogenesis, determine right- or left-handedness.",nan; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; SACCADIC EYE-MOVEMENTS; MONKEYS MACACA-FASCICULARIS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; OPTOKINETIC STIMULATION; GALVANIC STIMULATION; UNILATERAL NEGLECT; SPATIAL ATTENTION; PREFRONTAL CORTEX

AN OVERVIEW,"How certain neural mechanisms (Mc) momentarily endow with subjective awareness (C) percepts and affects represented elsewhere is more likely to be clarified when structures essential to Mc are identified. The loss of C with bilateral thalamic lesions involving the intralaminar nuclei (ILN) contrasts with retention of C after large cortical ablations depriving C of specific contents. A role of ILN in the perception of primitive (i.e., not cortically computed) sensations is suggested by their afference of directly ascending pathways. A role for ILN in awareness of cortical activity is suggested by their widespread afference from cortex, a property shared with striatum. A role for ILN in volition is suggested by their heavy projection to striatum. Unlike striatum, ILN also project widely to almost all neocortex, enabling an effect on ideation; this last property is in common with other structures (e.g., locus coeruleus) but none of them has the same direct cortical afference. And passage through the reticular nucleus (nRt) of ILN efferents to cortex could impact the attention-selective action of nRt. It is suggested that the quickest route to a better understanding of C involves more intensive study of ILN. No other structure seems, in the light of our current knowledge, a more likely site for Mc.

Recent patient studies have, however, re-established the mammillary bodies, and their projections to the anterior thalamus via the mammillothalamic tract, as being crucial for recollective memory. Complementary animal research has also made substantial advances in recent years by determining the electrophysiological, neurochemical, anatomical and functional properties of the mammillary bodies. Mammillary body and mammillothalamic tract lesions in rats impair performance on a number of spatial memory tasks and these deficits are consistent with impoverished spatial encoding. The mammillary bodies have traditionally been considered a hippocampal relay which is consistent with the equivalent deficits seen following lesions of the mammillary bodies or their major efferents, the mammillothalamic tract. However, recent findings suggest that the mammillary bodies may have a role in memory that is independent of their hippocampal formation afferents; instead, the ventral tegmental nucleus of Gudden could be providing critical mammillary body inputs needed to support mnemonic processes. Finally, it is now apparent that the medial and lateral mammillary nuclei should be considered separately and initial research indicates that the medial mammillary nucleus is predominantly responsible for the spatial memory deficits following mammillary body lesions in rats.

Non-symbolic number cognition based on an approximate sense of magnitude has been documented in a variety of vertebrate species, including fish. Fish, in particular zebrafish, are widely used as models for the investigation of the genetics and molecular mechanisms of behavior, and thus may be instrumental to development of a neurobiology of number cognition. We review here the behavioural studies that have permitted to identify numerical abilities in fish, and the current status of the research related to the neurobiological bases of these abilities with special reference to zebrafish. Combining behavioural tasks with molecular genetics, molecular biology and confocal microscopy, a role of the retina and optic tectum in the encoding of continuous magnitude in larval zebrafish has been reported, while the thalamus and the dorso-central subdivision of pallium in the encoding of discrete magnitude (number) has been documented in adult zebrafish. Research in fish, in particular zebrafish, may reveal instrumental for identifying and characterizing the molecular signature of neurons involved in quantity discrimination processes of all vertebrates, including humans.It is widely acknowledged that vertebrates can discriminate non-symbolic numerosity using an evolutionarily conserved system dubbed Approximate Number System (ANS). Two main approaches have been used to assess behaviourally numerosity in fish: spontaneous choice tests and operant training procedures. In the first, animals spontaneously choose between sets of biologically-relevant stimuli (e.g., conspecifics, food) differing in quantities (smaller or larger). In the second, animals are trained to associate a numerosity with a reward. Although the ability of fish to discriminate numerosity has been widely documented with these methods, the molecular bases of quantities estimation and ANS are largely unknown. Recently, we combined behavioral tasks with molecular biology assays (e.g c-fos and egr1 and other early genes expression) showing that the thalamus and the caudal region of dorso-central part of the telencephalon seem to be activated upon change in numerousness in visual stimuli. In contrast, the retina and the optic tectum mainly responded to changes in continuous magnitude such as stimulus size.

[H-3]Quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB), [H-3]cyclohexyladenosine (CHA), [H-3]muscimol, [H-3]MK-801, [H-3]SCH 23390, [H-3]naloxone, and [H-3]PN200-110 were used to label muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, adenosine A1 receptors, gamma-aminobutyric acid, (GABA(A)) receptors, N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, dopamine D, receptors, opioid receptors, and voltage dependent calcium channels, respectively. In middle-aged gerbils (16 months old), the hippocampus exhibited a significant elevation in [H-3]QNB, [H-3]MK-801, [H-3]SCH 23390, [H-3]naloxone, and [H-3]PN200-110 binding, whereas [H-3]CHA and [H-3]muscimol binding showed a significant reduction in this area, compared with that of young animals (1 month). On the other hand, the cerebellum showed a significant alteration in [H-3]QNB, [H-3]CHA, and [H-3]naloxone binding and the striatum also exhibited a significant alteration in [H-3]SCH 23390 and [H-3]CHA binding in middle-aged gerbils. The neocortex showed a significant elevation only in [H-3]CHA binding in middle-aged animals. The nucleus accumbens and thalamus also showed a significant alteration only in [H-3]muscimol binding. However, the hypothalamus and substantia nigra exhibited no significant alteration in these bindings in middle-aged gerbils. These results demonstrate the age-related alterations of various neurotransmitter receptors and voltage dependent calcium channels in most brain regions. Furthermore, they suggest that the hippocampus is most susceptible to aging processes and is altered at an early stage of senescence.",nan; BINDING-SITES; RHESUS-MONKEY; RAT-BRAIN; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; MAMMALIAN BRAIN; SENILE DEMENTIA; MEMORY; CALCIUM; RELEASE; AUTORADIOGRAPHY

To investigate the behavioural and neural correlates of motivation in unmedicated PD patients, we used (H2O)-O-15 positron emission tomography to measure brain activation patterns related to the processing of monetary rewards of different magnitudes during a spatial search task in PD patients withdrawn from medication, and age-matched healthy controls. Both groups showed increased search efficiency with increasing reward, but demonstrated different patterns of neuronal activation. In healthy controls activity in prefrontal and rhinal cortices, and thalamic activity correlated with reward magnitude. In contrast, activity in the cerebellar vermis in PD patients increased with increasing reward magnitude, suggesting it was sensitive to motivational state. We interpret these relative increases in cerebellar activation as evidence for the presence of compensatory neural mechanisms in unmedicated PD patients.",nan; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; MOVEMENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; DOPAMINERGIC MODULATION; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; VENTRAL STRIATUM; MACAQUE MONKEYS; WORKING-MEMORY; EXTERNAL CUES

Identification of the tongue area was carried out by electrical brain stimulation. Three different tracers were used: biotin-conjugated dextranamine (BDA), Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHA-L) and H-3-leucine. Intracortical projections were found to the motor cortex around the injection site, the premotor cortex, supplementary motor area, the homologues of the primate frontoparietal operculum and insula, the anterior cingulate and agrannular retrosplenial cortex, the somatosensory and bordering inferior parietal cortex as well as to the perirhinal cortex. Except the very weak projections into the retrosplenial, posterior parietal and perirhinal region which were ipsilateral, all other projections were bilateral. Subcortically, there was a projection into the ventral putamen, rostrodorsal claustrum and, very sparsely, into the caudate nucleus. In the rhalamus, terminal labeling was found in the nuclei reticularis, anteroventralis, anteromedialis, ventralis lateralis, ventralis posterior medialis, ventralis posterior inferior, medialis dorsalis, in the intralaminar nuclei paracentralis, centralis lateralis, centrum medianum and parafascicularis, in the midline thalamus and in the nuclei posterior and pulvinaris. Further diencephalic projections, however all of them weak, could be traced into the zona incerta, dorsolateral subthalamus, dorsomedial, lateral and supraoptic hypothalamus. In the midbrain, labeling was found in the deep layers of the lateral superior colliculus, in the bordering reticular formation and, very sparsely, in the periaqueductal grey. In the lower brainstem, fibres ended in the griseum pontis, dorsolateral reticular formation, principal and spinal trigeminal nucleus and, sparsely, in the lateral parabrachial region, solitary tract nucleus, inferior olive and magnocellular reticular formation. No terminals were found in the hypoglossal nucleus.

We histologically assessed these regions in 6 postmortem cases, plotted a flat map, and characterized differences in dorsal (d) and ventral (v) area 23. Subsequently, functional connectivity of histologically guided regions of interest (ROI) were assessed in 163 [F-18]fluorodeoxyglucose human cases with PET. Compared to area d23, area v23 had a higher density and larger pyramids in layers II, IIIc, and Vb and more intermediate neurofilament-expressing neurons in layer Va. Coregisirtration of each case to standard coordinates showed that the ventral branch of the splenial sulci coincided with the border between d/v PCC at -5.4 +/- 0.17 cm from the vertical plane and +1.97 +/- 0.08 cm from the bi-commissural line. Correlation analysis of glucose metabolism using histologically guided ROIs suggested important circuit differences including dorsal and ventral visual stream inputs, interactions between the vPCC and subgenual cingulate cortex, and preferential relations between dPCC and the cingulate motor region. The RSC, in contrast, had restricted correlated activity with pericallosal cortex and thalamus. Visual information may be processed with an orbitofrontal link for synthesis activity through dPCC. Review of the of signals to drive premotor literature in terms of a PCC duality suggests that interactions of dPCC, including area 23d, orient the body in space via the cingulate motor areas, while vPCC interacts with subgenual cortex to process self-relevant emotional and non-emotional information and objects and self-reflection.

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the neural response to scenes that were visually distinct (beach images vs freeway images) and experienced as tranquil (beach) or non-tranquil (freeway) Both sets of scenes had the same auditory component because waves breaking on a beach and vehicles moving on a freeway can produce similar auditory spectral and temporal characteristics. perceived as a constant roar Compared with scenes experienced as non-tranquil, we found that subjectively tranquil scenes were associated with significantly greater effective connectivity between the auditory cortex and medial prefrontal cortex, a region implicated in the evaluation of mental states Similarly enhanced connectivity was also observed between the auditory cortex and posterior cingulate gyrus, temporoparietal cortex and thalamus. These findings demonstrate that visual context can modulate connectivity of the auditory cortex with regions implicated in the generation of subjective states Importantly, this effect arises under conditions of identical auditory input. Hence, the same sound may be associated with different percepts reflecting varying connectivity between the auditory cortex and other brain regions. This suggests that subjective experience is more closely linked to the connectivity state of the auditory cortex than to its basic sensory inputs (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc All rights reserved",nan; RHESUS-MONKEY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; VISUAL SPEECH; MULTISENSORY INTEGRATION; FUNCTIONAL IMPLICATIONS; CORTICAL CONNECTIONS; SOCIAL COGNITION; DEFAULT MODE; BRAIN; ATTENTION

Single-shot gradient-echo echoplanar image (EPI) volumes were sensitive to BOLD contrast in oblique orientation.

Our fMRI results show that a load increase in a nonverbal auditory working memory task is associated with enhanced brain activity in the parietal, dorsal premotor, and lateral prefrontal cortices and in lobules VII-VIII of the posterior cerebellum, whereas a sensory-motor control task activated the motor/somatosensory, medial prefrontal, and posterior cingulate cortices and lobules V/VI of the anterior cerebellum. The load-dependent activity in the crus I/II had a specific relationship with cognitive performance: This activity correlated negatively with load-dependent increase in RTs. This correlation between brain activity and RTs was not observed in the sensory-motor task in the activated cerebellar regions. Furthermore, probabilistic tractography analysis of the diffusion-weighted MRI data suggests that the tracts between the cerebral and the cerebellar areas exhibiting cognitive load-dependent and sensory-motor activity are mainly projected via separated pontine (feed-forward tracts) and thalamic (feedback tracts) nuclei. The tractography results also indicate that the crus I/II in the posterior cerebellum is linked with the lateral prefrontal areas activated by cognitive load increase, whereas the anterior cerebellar lobe is not. The current results support the view that cognitive and motor functions are segregated in the cerebellum. On the basis of these results and theories of the function of the cerebellum, we suggest that the posterior cerebellar activity during a demanding cognitive task is involved with optimization of the response speed.",nan; VERBAL WORKING-MEMORY; INFERIOR PARIETAL LOBULE; RHESUS-MONKEY; CORTICOPONTINE PROJECTION; ANATOMICAL PARCELLATION; CEREBELLAR CONTRIBUTION; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; SPATIAL ATTENTION; BASAL GANGLIA

However, both aging and estradiol regulate SERT binding sites in the brain. The goal of this experiment was to determine how aging and estrogen interact to regulate SERT levels in the forebrain of young and reproductively senescent female Sprague-Dawley rats using [H-3]paroxetine. The density of specific [H-3]paroxetine binding in various brain regions was compared in young (2-4 months) and reproductively senescent (10-12 months) female rats at three times of day. In most brain regions examined, estrogen and aging independently increased the number of [H-3]paroxetine binding sites. The only region that displayed a reduction in [H-3]paroxetine binding with age was the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Time of day influenced [H-3]paroxetine binding in the SCN and the paraventricular thalamus (PVT), two regions known to be involved in the regulation of circadian rhythms. Aging and/or estrogen also altered the pattern of binding in these regions. Thus, based on the results of this study, we conclude that aging and estrogen both act to regulate SERT binding sites in the forebrain of female rats, and that this regulation is region specific.

In Experiment 1, we combined 10-Hz rTMS with a speech task to examine rTMS-induced changes in paralinguistic aspects of speech production, an affect-relevant behavior strongly linked to the ACC. In Experiment 2, we combined 10-Hz rTMS with positron emission tomography (PET) and used partial least squares (PLS) to identify a pattern of brain regions whose connectivity with the site of stimulation varied as a function of rTMS. The results of Experiment 1 revealed that following stimulation of the left MDLFC, subjects reported having less positive affect and vitality and displayed more monotonous speech. In Experiment 2, results revealed that 10-Hz rTMS influenced the covariation between blood flow at the site of stimulation (ie the left MDLFC) and blood flow in a number of affect-relevant brain regions including the perigenual anterior cingulate gyrus, insula, thalamus, parahippocampal gyrus, and caudate nucleus. Taken together, our results suggest that changes in affect and affect-relevant behaviour following 10-Hz rTMS applied over the left MDLFC may be related to changes in neural activity in brain regions widely implicated in affective states, including a frontocingulate circuit.",repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation; positron emission tomography; pitch variation; affect; functional connectivity; prefrontal cortex; anterior cingulate cortex; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MAJOR DEPRESSION; RHESUS-MONKEY; TREATMENT RESPONSE; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; HEALTHY-VOLUNTEERS

For both patients, spatial deficits were defined in both a retinotopic and an object-based frame.

To elucidate the neuronal mechanisms and origin of ECRF suppression in V1 of anesthetized cats, we examined the temporal properties of the spatial extent and orientation specificity of ECRF suppression in V1 and the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), using stationary-flashed sinusoidal grating. In V1, we found three components of ECRF suppression: 1) local and fast, 2) global and fast, and 3) global and late. The local and fast component, which resulted from within 2 of the boundary of the CRF, started no more than 10 ms after the onset of the CRF response and exhibited low specificity for the orientation of the ECRF stimulus. These spatiotemporal properties corresponded to those of geniculate ECRF suppression, suggesting that the local and fast component of V1 is inherited from the LGN. In contrast, the two global components showed rather large spatial extents similar to 5 degrees from the CRF boundary and high specificity for orientation, suggesting that their possible origin is the cortex, not the LGN. Correspondingly, the local component was observed in all neurons of the thalamocortical recipient layer, while the global component was biased toward other layers. Therefore, we conclude that both subcortical and cortical mechanisms with different spatiotemporal properties are involved in ECRF suppression.",contextual modulation; size tuning; extraclassical receptive field; surround suppression; CLASSICAL RECEPTIVE-FIELD; RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; MACAQUE STRIATE CORTEX; CONTEXTUAL RESPONSE MODULATION; FEEDBACK CONNECTIONS; SPATIAL SUMMATION; CORTICOCORTICAL CONNECTIONS; AREA 17; FUNCTIONAL ARCHITECTURE; HORIZONTAL CONNECTIONS

The fact that the retina contains both non-spiking and spiking neurons leads us to frame questions about neural coding in a general fashion, rather than in a manner specific either to point processes or continuous signals. In particular, we ask about the role of the statistical structure of the response, the extent to which the neural representation is 'literal', and how information content can be estimated from laboratory data. The broad theme that emerges from a review of experimental data is that each stage of visual processing is accompanied by new features, including adaptive filtering, feedback, rectification and spike generation.

Yet, the forebrain pathway that processes auditory spatial information is not known for any species. Using standard anatomic labeling techniques, we used a top-down approach to trace the flow of auditory spatial information from an output area of the forebrain sound localization pathway (the auditory archistriatum, AAr), back through the fore brain, and into the auditory midbrain. Previous work has demonstrated that AAr units are specialized for auditory space processing. The results presented here show that the AAr receives afferent input from Field L both directly and indirectly via the caudolateral neostriatum. Afferent input to Field L originates mainly in the auditory thalamus, nucleus ovoidalis, which, in turn, receives input from the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus. In addition, we confirmed previously reported projections of the AAr to the basal ganglia, the external nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICX), the deep layers of the optic tectum, and various brain stem nuclei. A series of inactivation experiments demonstrated that the sharp tuning of AAr sites for binaural spatial cues depends on field L input but not on input from the auditory space map in the midbrain ICX: pharmacological inactivation of Field L eliminated completely auditory responses in the AAr, whereas bilateral ablation of the midbrain ICX had no appreciable effect on AAr responses. We conclude, therefore, that the forebrain sound localization pathway can process auditory spatial information independently of the midbrain localization pathway.",nan; FRONTAL EYE FIELD; ARCHISTRIATAL GAZE FIELDS; SOUND-LOCALIZATION; OPTIC TECTUM; INFERIOR COLLICULUS; RHESUS-MONKEY; INTERAURAL TIME; CORTEX LESIONS; COLUMBA-LIVIA; PROJECTIONS

We studied the nature of the modulatory effects of SRF stimulation with respect to stimulus contrast in cat V1. In 51 V1 neurons studied, large SRF stimuli (40 degrees x 30 degrees) induced only the suppression of responses to CRF stimulation and the suppressive effects became stronger as the contrast for SRF stimulation increased. The contrast sensitivity of SRF suppression did not correlate with that of CRF responses. By independently controlling contrast of CRF and SRF stimuli, we studied whether SRF effects vary with CRF response magnitude. Increasing contrast for CRF stimulation caused an upward shift of the range of effective contrasts for SRF stimulation, indicating that a high contrast for SRF stimulation is required for suppressing strong responses to CRF stimulation at high contrasts. To assess the possible origin of the suppressive SRF effect on V1 neurons, we also investigated the contrast dependency of SRF effects in 28 neurons from the lateral geniculate nucleus. Our results suggest that SRF effects obtained at the subcortical level strongly contribute to those in V1. Taken together, we conclude that along the thalamocortical projections, SRF modulation exhibits a gain-control mechanism that scales the suppressive SRF effect depending on the contrast for CRF stimulation. In addition, SRF effects can be facilitatory at low stimulus contrasts potentially due to the enlargement of the summation field.",receptive field; stimulus contrast; surround suppression; summation area; CLASSICAL RECEPTIVE-FIELD; MACAQUE V1 NEURONS; SPATIAL SUMMATION; STRIATE CORTEX; CORTICAL-NEURONS; ALERT MONKEYS; CELLS; INHIBITION; SUPPRESSION; LENGTH

In most experiments, portions of auditory cortex were first explored with microelectrodes, neurons were characterized as responsive or not to auditory stimuli, and best frequencies were determined whenever possible. Most recordings were in cortex previously designated as primary (A-I) and rostral (R) auditory fields (Imig et al. J Comp Neurol 171:111, '77) and in a newly defined rostrotemporal field (RT) located rostral to R. Injections of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) and fluorescent tracers were placed in electrophysiologically identified locations of A-1, R, and RT; the posterolateral (PL) and anterolateral (AL) divisions of a narrow belt of auditory cortex lateral and adjacent to A-I and R; cortex of the superior temporal gyrus lateral and rostrolateral to PL and AL; and regions of prefrontal cortex that receive inputs from auditory cortex. There were several major findings: 1. Best frequencies were most clearly determined for neurons within a densely myelinated strip of cortex on the lower bank and lip of the lateral sulcus. We divided this strip into three fields, A-I, R, and RT, although an alternative interpretation that A-1 and R are parts of a single field remains tenable. In some cases, isofrequency contours appeared to continue uninterrupted across fields A-I and R, with lower frequencies represented laterally and higher frequencies represented deeper in the sulcus. In other cases, there was a tendency for high frequencies to be represented caudally and medially, and low frequencies laterally in A-1 and rostrally in R, with partial discontinuity in the isofrequency contours. A reversal of the tonotopic gradient appeared in RT with a common low-frequency representation at the caudal border with R, and progressively higher frequencies encountered rostrally. Of the three fields, A-I appears slightly more myelinated than R, and RT slightly less than R. The distinctiveness of the three fields is further demonstrated by the patterns of connections. In particular, A-I and RT are both interconnected with R, but not with each other. Connections between A-1 and R are between tonotopically matched locations. 2. A narrow 2-3 mm wide band of cortex lateral to A-I, R, and RT was also responsive to auditory stimuli, but typically neurons were more difficult to activate, and best frequencies were more difficult to determine. No distinctions in myeloarchitecture or CO activity were obvious. Nevertheless, regions roughly corresponding to previously distinguished PL and AL divisions of the belt cortex (Imig et al. J Comp Neurol 17 1:111, '77) were interconnected. Both PL and AL were connected with R, but PL was connected with A-I while AL was connected with RT. We also denoted a lateral rostrotemporal zone lateral to RT, with inputs from R, RT, and cortex rostral to RT. 3. Another proposed subdivision is CM, a moderately myelinated area medial to A-I that is somewhat smaller than the CM of Imig et al. ('77). CM has connections with A-I, R, PL, and AL. Other parts of the caudal, medial, and rostral belt cortex have auditory connections either from the core areas or other parts of the belt, so that overall there appear to be seven or more fields, but the exact number and boundaries remain uncertain. 4. Patterns of connections also implicate cortex lateral and laterorostral to the belt in auditory function. Cortex lateral to PL interconnects with PL and cortex lateral to AL, and this cortex and the cortex lateral and rostral to the belt have inputs from the auditory thalamus. 5. PL, AL and cortex lateral to these fields connect with cortex rostromedial to the frontal eye field. A-I, R, and RT do not directly connect with prefrontal cortex. 6. In the thalamus, the ventral division of the medial geniculate complex (MGV) projects to A-I, R, RT, and possibly weakly to PL and AL. The projections to different tonotopic locations in A-I and R suggest that low frequencies are represented caudoventrally and high frequencies rostrodorsally in MGV. The medial or magnocellular division (MGM) has more widespread projections to auditory cortex, including A-I, R, AL, and the lateral rostral temporal area (LRT). Although less precise than those of MGV, projections to A-I from MGM tend to be topographically organized with neurons projecting to high-frequency targets distributed dorsal to neurons projecting to low-frequency targets. The dorsal division, MGD, projects to R, RT, AL, and LRT, with more rostral fields receiving projections from the more caudal regions of MGD. The suprageniculate and limitans nuclei, as well as the medial pulvinar, also contribute to auditory fields outside the core areas A-I, R, and RT. 7. A-I, R, and RT project to the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (CN), with A-I projections extending into the laminated portion of the CN. Other parts of the auditory cortex, including AL and rostrolateral temporal cortex, project to the dorsal cortex (DC) and external nucleus (EN).",MEDIAL GENICULATE; INFERIOR COLLICULUS; FRONTAL LOBE; PULVINAR; MEDIAL GENICULATE-BODY; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL REGION; CORTICO-CORTICAL CONNECTIONS; CALLITHRIX-JACCHUS-JACCHUS; OLD-WORLD MONKEYS; RHESUS-MONKEY; INFERIOR COLLICULUS; TONOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; MACAQUE MONKEY

While some of these adjustments occur at specific stages, others may be inherited from earlier stages. How do adaptation effects cascade along the visual system? We measured spatially selective adaptation at two successive stages in the mouse visual system: visual thalamus (LGN) and primary visual cortex (V1). This form of adaptation affected both stages but in drastically different ways: in LGN it only changed response gain, while in V1 it also shifted spatial tuning away from the adaptor. These effects, however, are reconciled by a simple model whereby V1 neurons summate LGN inputs with a fixed, unadaptable weighting profile. These results indicate that adaptation effects cascade through the visual system, that this cascading can shape selectivity, and that the rules of integration from one stage to the next are not themselves adaptable.",nan; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; UNDERLYING CONTRAST ADAPTATION; RECEPTIVE-FIELD PROPERTIES; ADAPTABLE MECHANISMS; CORTICAL-NEURONS; SIMPLE CELLS; IN-VIVO; CORTEX; MACAQUE; MOTION

Immunohistochemistry was performed on 70 mu m sections from FTLD-TDP autopsy cases (n = 39) presenting with behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia. Two main types of cortical pTDP-43 pathology emerged, characterized by either predominantly perikaryal pTDP-43 inclusions (cytoplasmic type, cFTLD) or long aggregates in dendrites (neuritic type, nFTLD). Cortical involvement in nFTLD was extensive and frequently reached occipital areas, whereas cases with cFTLD often involved bulbar somatomotor neurons and the spinal cord. We observed four patterns indicative of potentially sequential dissemination of pTDP-43: cases with the lowest burden of pathology (pattern I) were characterized by widespread pTDP-43 lesions in the orbital gyri, gyrus rectus, and amygdala. With increasing burden of pathology (pattern II) pTDP-43 lesions emerged in the middle frontal and anterior cingulate gyrus as well as in anteromedial temporal lobe areas, the superior and medial temporal gyri, striatum, red nucleus, thalamus, and precerebellar nuclei. More advanced cases showed a third pattern (III) with involvement of the motor cortex, bulbar somatomotor neurons, and the spinal cord anterior horn, whereas cases with the highest burden of pathology (pattern IV) were characterized by pTDP-43 lesions in the visual cortex. We interpret the four neuropathological patterns in bvFTD to be consistent with the hypothesis that pTDP-43 pathology can spread sequentially and may propagate along axonal pathways.","ALS, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Frontotemporal lobar degeneration; FTLD, frontotemporal dementia; FTD; Neurodegeneration; Proteinopathies; TDP-43; AMYOTROPHIC-LATERAL-SCLEROSIS; MULTIPLE SYSTEM ATROPHY; LOBAR DEGENERATION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; RHESUS-MONKEY; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; FRONTAL-LOBE; CLINICOPATHOLOGICAL CORRELATIONS; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX"

Understanding these communicative signals and integrating them into a common percept is paramount to successful social behaviour. While many previous studies have focused on the neurobiology of emotional communication in the auditory or visual modality alone, far less is known about multimodal integration of auditory and visual non-verbal emotional information. The present study investigated this process using event-related fMRI. Behavioural data revealed that audiovisual presentation of non-verbal emotional information resulted in a significant increase in correctly classified stimuli when compared with visual and auditory stimulation. This behavioural gain was paralleled by enhanced activation in bilateral posterior superior temporal gyrus (pSTG) and right thalamus, when contrasting audiovisual to auditory and visual conditions. Further, a characteristic of these brain regions, substantiating their role in the emotional integration process, is a linear relationship between the gain in classification accuracy and the strength of the BOLD response during the bimodal condition. Additionally, enhanced effective connectivity between audiovisual integration areas and associative auditory and visual cortices was observed during audiovisual stimulation, offering further insight into the neural process accomplishing multimodal integration. Finally, we were able to document an enhanced sensitivity of the putative integration sites to stimuli with emotional non-verbal content as compared to neutral stimuli. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

While the phenomenon of functional cortical reorganization is well established, it remains unknown whether in humans, functional reorganization results from changes in brain anatomy, or simply reflects an unmasking of already existing dormant synapses. In 20 subjects with complete thoracic spinal cord injuries (SCIs) and 23 controls, we used functional and structural magnetic resonance imaging to determine whether SI reorganization was associated with changes in SI anatomy. SCI resulted in a significant SI reorganization, with the little finger representation moving medially toward the lower body representation (i.e., area of sensory loss). Furthermore, although SCI was associated with gray matter volume loss in the lower body representation, this loss was minimized as reorganization increased. That is, the greater the medial shift in little finger representation, the greater the gray matter preservation in the lower body representation. In addition, in the region of greatest SI reorganization (little finger), fractional anisotropy was correlated with SI reorganization. That is, as SI reorganization increased, the extent of aligned structures decreased. Finally, although thalamocortical fibers remained unchanged, the ease and direction of water movement within the little finger representation was altered, being directed more toward the midline in SCI subjects. These data show that SI reorganization following SCI is associated with changes in SI anatomy and provide compelling evidence that SI reorganization in humans results from the growth of new lateral connections, and not simply from the unmasking of already existing lateral connections.",nan; FMRI TIME-SERIES; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; ADULT MONKEYS; TOPOGRAPHIC REORGANIZATION; PHANTOM SENSATIONS; DIGIT AMPUTATION; MACAQUE MONKEYS; STRIATE CORTEX; SENSORY CORTEX; PAIN

The time-course and sensitivity of excitatory postsynaptic potentials to current injected at the soma, and locations of close appositions between presynaptic axons and postsynaptic dendrites, indicated that the majority of contributory synapses were located in layer V. Within a column of tissue, radius less than or equal to 250 mu m, the probability that a randomly selected layer III pyramid innervated a layer V pyramid was I in 4 if the target cell was a burst firing pyramid with an apical dendritic tuft in layers II/I. If, however, the potential target was a regular spiking pyramid, the probability of connectivity was only 1 in 40, and none of the 13 anatomically identified postsynaptic layer V targets had a slender apical dendrite terminating in layers IV/III. Morphological reconstructions indicated that layer III pyramids select target layer V cells whose apical dendrites pass within 50-100 mu m of the soma of the presynaptic pyramid in layer III and which have overlapping apical dendritic tufts in the superficial layers. The probability that a layer V cell would innervate a layer III pyramid lying within 250 mu m of its apical dendrite was much lower (one in 58). Both presynaptic layer III pyramids and their large postsynaptic layer V targets could therefore access similar inputs in layers I/II, while small layer V pyramids could not. One prediction from the present data would be that neither descending layer V inputs to the striatum or thalamus, nor transcallosal connections would be readily activated by longer distance cortico-cortical feedback connections that terminated in layers I/II. These could, however, activate corticofugal pathways to the superior colliculus or pens, both directly and via layer III. (C) 1998 IBRO.

Likewise, during natural tactile behaviors, spatially extensive regions of the somatosensory surface are co-activated. The large spatial extent of naturalistic stimulation means that surround suppression, a phenomenon whose neural mechanisms remain a matter of debate, must arise during natural behavior. To identify common neural motifs that might instantiate surround suppression across modalities, we review models of surround suppression and compare the evidence supporting the competing ideas that surround suppression has either cortical or subcortical origins in visual and barrel cortex. In the visual system there is general agreement lateral inhibitory mechanisms contribute to surround suppression, but little direct experimental evidence that intracortical inhibition plays a major role. Two intracellular recording studies of V1, one using naturalistic stimuli (Haider et al., 2010), the other sinusoidal gratings (Ozeki et al., 2009), sought to identify the causes of reduced activity in V1 with increasing stimulus size, a hallmark of surround suppression. The former attributed this effect to increased inhibition, the latter to largely balanced withdrawal of excitation and inhibition. In rodent primary somatosensory barrel cortex, multi-whisker responses are generally weaker than single whisker responses, suggesting multi-whisker stimulation engages similar surround suppressive mechanisms. The origins of suppression in S1 remain elusive: studies have implicated brainstem lateral/internuclear interactions and both thalamic and cortical inhibition. Although the anatomical organization and instantiation of surround suppression in the visual and somatosensory systems differ, we consider the idea that one common function of surround suppression, in both modalities, is to remove the statistical redundancies associated with natural stimuli by increasing the sparsenessor selectivity of sensory responses.",inhibition; S1; somatosensory cortex; sparse coding; suppression; V1; vibrissae; visual cortex; RAT SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; CLASSICAL RECEPTIVE-FIELD; STEM SUBNUCLEUS INTERPOLARIS; MEMBRANE-POTENTIAL DYNAMICS; TRIGEMINAL GANGLION NEURONS; POSTERIOR MEDIAL THALAMUS; FREELY MOVING MICE; MACAQUE V1 NEURONS; FAST-SPIKING CELLS; SENSORY RESPONSES

While some studies - especially those employing functional magnetic resonance imaging - imply that this is the case, others - particularly those recording from single neurons - suggest that it is not. In the light of this ongoing controversy, it is surprising that the analogous question in other sensory modalities has received far less attention. The first part of the present article reviews studies relevant to the role of primary auditory and primary somatosensory cortices in conscious auditory and tactile experience. As will become evident, the results of these studies, at least at first sight, appear no less contradictory than those obtained in the visual modality - in fact, they evidence discrepancies that resemble those found in the visual system to an impressive degree. The second part of the article attempts to reconcile the seemingly contradictory data by suggesting that only activity induced in the primary sensory cortices through cortico-cortical top-down signals can become consciously accessible, whereas activity induced by bottom-up signals from the thalamus cannot. This conclusion is in line with the earlier proposals of several prominent neuroscientists that portrayed conscious perception as the result of an active interpretative process by the brain, rather than a passive reflection of the environment.

A key feature of the LGN is the segregation of retinal inputs into different cellular layers characterized by their differential responses to red-green (RG) color (L/M opponent), blue-yellow (BY) color (S-cone opponent) and achromatic (Ach) contrast. In this study we use high-field functional magnetic resonance imaging (4 tesla, 3.6 x 3.6 x 3 mm(3)) to record simultaneously the responses of the human LGN and V1 to chromatic and Ach contrast to investigate the LGN responses to color, and how these are modified as information transfers between LGN and cortex. We find that the LGN has a robust response to RG color contrast, equal to or greater than the Ach response, but a significantly poorer sensitivity to BY contrast. In V1 at low temporal rates (2 Hz), however, the sensitivity of the BY color pathway is selectively enhanced, rising in relation to the RG and Ach responses. We find that this effect generalizes across different stimulus contrasts and spatial stimuli (1-d and 2-d patterns), but is selective for temporal frequency, as it is not found for stimuli at 8 Hz. While the mechanism of this cortical enhancement of BY color vision and its dynamic component is unknown, its role may be to compensate for a weak BY signal originating from the sparse distribution of neurons in the retina and LGN.",color; fMRI; LGN; S-cone; V1; visual cortex; MARMOSET CALLITHRIX-JACCHUS; CONTRAST SENSITIVITY; DETECTION MECHANISMS; CHROMATIC MECHANISMS; MACAQUE MONKEYS; STRIATE CORTEX; GANGLION-CELLS; AWAKE MACAQUE; ACTIVATION; ATTENTION

Voxelbased morphometry (VBM) was applied to magnetic resonance images of strabismic adults to detect any abnormal brain anatomy, which could not be easily identified by simple inspection. The gray matter volume in strabismic adults was smaller than that in normal subjects at the areas consistent with the occipital eye field (OEF) and parietal eye field (PEF). However, greater gray matter volume was found in strabismic adults relative to normal controls at the areas consistent with the frontal eye field (FEF), the supplementary eye field (SEF), the prefrontal cortex (PFC), and subcortical regions such as the thalamus and the basal ganglia. These opposite gray matter changes in the visual and the oculomotor processing areas are compatible with a hypothesis of plasticity in the oculomotor regions to compensate for the cortical deficits in the visual processing areas.

Cortical and subcortical mechanisms that underlie this reorganization are uncertain and appear to be manifold. Here we show that the face afferents from the trigeminal nucleus of the brainstem sprout and grow into the cuneate nucleus in adult monkeys after lesions of the dorsal columns of the spinal cord or therapeutic amputation of an arm.

To what extent these interactions are present in the human brain remains unclear; however, these connections are thought to provide an important framework for understanding cerebellar contributions to the manifestation of basal ganglia disorders, especially with respect to tremor genesis in movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease. Here, we tested the feasibility of assessing these connections in vivo and non-invasively in the human brain with diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and tractography. After developing a standardized protocol for manual segmentation of basal ganglia and cerebellar structures, masks for diffusion tractography were defined based on structural magnetic resonance images. We tested intra- and inter-observer stability and carried out tractography for dentato-pallidal and subthalamo-cerebellar projections. After robustly achieving connection probabilities per tract, the connectivity values and connectional fingerprints were calculated in a group of healthy volunteers. Probabilistic diffusion tractography was applicable to probe the inter-connection of the cerebellum and basal ganglia. Our data confirmed that dentato-thalamo-striato-pallidal and subthalamo-cerebellar connections also exist in the human brain at a level similar to those that were recently suggested by transneuronal tracing studies in non-human primates. Standardized segmentation protocols made these findings reproducible with high stability. We have demonstrated that diffusion tractography in humans in vivo is capable of revealing the structural bases of cerebellar networks with the basal ganglia. These findings support the role of the cerebellum as a satellite system of established cortico-basal ganglia networks in humans.",basal ganglia; cerebellum; diffusion magnetic resonance imaging; segmentation protocol; tractography; DIFFUSION TRACTOGRAPHY; VALIDATION; CORTEX; SEGMENTATION; OPTIMIZATION; REGISTRATION; THALAMUS; NUCLEUS; ROBUST; ATLAS

In spite of the extensive experimental and theoretical effort over the past 50 years, it has been difficult to establish how this diversity of functional-response properties emerges in the cortex. One of the reasons is that while functional studies in the early visual pathway have been usually carried out in vivo with extracellular recording techniques, investigations about the precise structure of the cortical network have mainly been conducted in vitro. Thus, the link between structure and function has rarely been explicitly established, remaining a well-known controversial issue.

Electron microscopic observations revealed the presence of different triadic types, the intercalated element being in all cases a presynaptic dendrite or soma of an interneuron (I-cell), and the output component being constantly a dendrite or soma of a geniculocortical projection or principal neuron (P-cell). The axonal input to the triads, however, was found to be of three different types: (1) the majority were retinal axon terminals; (2) a smaller fraction were the axonal endings of corticogeniculate fibers, always connected to thin, distal P-cell dendrites; (3) others were terminals with pleomorphic or flattened, small synaptic vesicles, probably belonging to axons of I-cells and/or of thalamic reticular nucleus origin. It was observed also that the retinal terminals established multiple synaptic contacts with both P-cell and I-cell dendrites. Essentially, two types of triadic arrangements with retinal input were recognized: the simple unit, frequent in parvicellular laminae, in which the retinal axon was accompanied by only 1-2 presynaptic dendrites; and the complex unit, found mostly in the magnocellular laminae, characterized by the presence of up to eight presynaptic dendrites. In the glomerular complex units, closely packed classical triads, with the three synaptic junctions localized close to each other, coexisted with triads at a distance where the synapses were distributed relatively far from each other. The coupling by presynaptic dendrites of closely-packed and at a distance triads resulted in the formation of multiple triadic arrangements. Since cortical and inhibitory triads were never seen to be involved in multiple triadic complexes, the latter appeared exclusively retinal in nature. The possible functional significance of multiple triads in ON-gating operation is briefly discussed.",TRIADIC SYNAPSES CLOSELY PACKED; TRIADIC SYNAPSES AT A DISTANCE; NON-RETINAL TRIADS; MONKEY; LATERAL GENICULATE NUCLEUS; GLUTAMIC-ACID DECARBOXYLASE; GABA-IMMUNOREACTIVE NEURONS; DENDRO-DENDRITIC SYNAPSES; INHIBITORY PATHWAYS; GABAERGIC NEURONS; PRINCIPAL CELLS; RHESUS-MONKEY; X-CELLS; Y-CELLS; CAT

We analysed CT/MRI and single photon emission tomography (SPET) findings from 37 patients studied in the chronic phase of stroke (mean duration+/-SD=3.6+/-1.6 months), whom we were able to follow clinically for a period of 3 months. The eventual degree of motor recovery correlated significantly (negatively) with the rime since stroke at entry, but nor with the severity of neurological impairment at entry. The volume side and location (cortical or subcortical) of the infarct did not correlate with either the severity or the evolution of the motor deficit Patients with a CT/MRI lesion of the parietal lobe (n = 8) showed a more severe motor deficit than those with other cortical locations. The severity of the motor deficit correlated significantly (negatively) with CBF values in the supplementary motor area (SMA) and parietal areas of the damaged hemisphere, and in the contralateral undamaged primary motor cortex. The degree of motor improvement correlated significantly (positively) with CBF values in the contralateral undamaged thalamus, lentiform and caudate nuclei, and premotor cortex.

The psychological competences are: Language development, a sense of right and wrong, self-awareness, and the ability to make inferences, The accompanying changes in the brain involve the prefrontal cortex, language-related cortical areas, hippocampus, cerebellum, basal ganglia and an increase in the connectivity of the network. Of special interest are the maturational changes in layers III-IV of the prefrontal cortex. Layer III is the origin and target of callosal and commissural axons linking the two hemispheres and the target of associational axons linking ipsilateral areas within each hemisphere. Layer IV, the target for axons from the mediodorsal nucleus of the thalamus, conveys information from other associational cortices, cerebellum, basal ganglia, and the reticular and limbic systems. In the second year, intensive dendritic growth and synaptogenesis in these layers increase the linking of these two layers and form a neural basis for a more efficient convergence and integration of information from the two hemispheres, which are functionally asymmetric. It is our hypothesis that these changes, together with the maturational changes in the cortico-subcortical network, are a basis for the observed emergence of the psychological competences. We are aware that temporal correlations cannot prove firm causal relationships.

The functional interactions between brain areas, including those observed during rest, are assumed to stem from the collective influence of action potentials carried by long-range neural projections. However, the contribution of individual neurons to brain-wide functional connectivity has not been systematically assessed. Here we developed a method to concurrently measure and compare the spiking activity of local neurons with fMRI signals measured across the brain during rest. We recorded spontaneous activity from neural populations in cortical face patches in the macaque during fMRI scanning sessions. Individual cells exhibited prominent, bilateral coupling with fMRI fluctuations in a restricted set of cortical areas inside and outside the face patch network, partially matching the pattern of known anatomical projections. Within each face patch population, a subset of neurons was positively coupled with the face patch network and another was negatively coupled. The same cells showed inverse correlations with distinct subcortical structures, most notably the lateral geniculate nucleus and brainstem neuromodulatory centers. Corresponding connectivity maps derived from fMRI seeds and local field potentials differed from the single unit maps, particularly in subcortical areas. Together, the results demonstrate that the spiking fluctuations of neurons are selectively coupled with discrete brain regions, with the coupling governed in part by anatomical network connections and in part by indirect neuromodulatory pathways.",simultaneous fMRI and neurophysiology; single units; resting state; face patches; brain networks; MONKEY VISUAL-CORTEX; TEMPORAL AREAS TE; SUBCORTICAL CONNECTIONS; STEM CORE; FMRI; FLUCTUATIONS; BOLD; PROJECTIONS; DYNAMICS; THALAMUS

Concurrent stimulation of many patches by means of the pseudorandom, binary m-sequence technique revealed interactions between their respective responses. An analysis identified two distinct components of local field potentials: a fast local component (FLC) and a slow distributed component (SDC). The FLC is thought to be a primarily postsynaptic response, as judged by its relatively short latency. It is directly generated by thalamocortical volleys following retinotopic stimulation of receptive fields of a small cluster of single cells, combined with responses to recurrent excitation and inhibition derived from the cells under study and immediately neighboring cells. In contrast, the SDC is thought to be an aggregate of dendritic potentials related to the long-range lateral connections (i.e. long-range coupling). We compared the suppressive effects of a GABA(A)-receptor agonist, muscimol, on the FLC and SDC with those of a GABA(B)-receptor agonist, baclofen, and found that muscimol more strongly suppressed the FLC than the SDC, and that the reverse was the case for baclofen. The differential suppression of the FLC and SDC found in the present study is consistent with the notion that intracortical electrical signals related to the FLC terminate on the somata and proximal/basal dendrites, while those related to the SDC terminate on distal dendrites.",long-range lateral interactions; GABA(A)- and GABA(B) -receptors; fast local potentials; slow distributed potentials; binary m-sequence; multi-input nonlinear systems analysis; cat striate cortex; MACAQUE V1 NEURONS; CLASSICAL RECEPTIVE-FIELD; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; GABA(B) RECEPTORS; STRIATE CORTEX; RAT-BRAIN; HORIZONTAL CONNECTIONS; MONOCULAR DEPRIVATION; FEEDBACK CONNECTIONS; SPATIAL SUMMATION

In this present cross-sectional study, we aimed to search for neural networks with electroencephalography whose frequency-specific actions may predict bradykinesia. Methods: Twenty Parkinsonian patients treated with bilateral subthalamic stimulation were first prescreened while we selected four levels of contralateral stimulation (0: OFF, 1-3: decreasing symptoms to ON state) individually, based on kinematics. In the screening period, we performed 64-channel electroencephalography measurements simultaneously with electromyography and motion detection during a resting state, finger tapping, hand grasping tasks, and pronation-supination of the arm, with the four levels of contralateral stimulation. We analyzed spectral power at the low (13-20 Hz) and high (21-30 Hz) beta frequency bands and low (31-60 Hz) and high (61-100 Hz) gamma frequency bands using the dynamic imaging of coherent sources. Structural equation modelling estimated causal relationships between the slope of changes in network beta and gamma activities and the slope of changes in bradykinesia measures. Results: Activity in different subnetworks, including predominantly the primary motor and premotor cortex, the subthalamic nucleus predicted the slopes in amplitude and speed while switching between stimulation levels. These subnetwork dynamics on their preferred frequencies predicted distinct types and parameters of the movement only on the contralateral side. Discussion: Concurrent subnetworks affected in bradykinesia and their activity changes in the different frequency bands are specific to the type and parameters of the movement; and the primary motor and premotor cortex are common nodes.",Beta oscillation; Gamma oscillation; Bradykinesia; Parkinson disease; Deep brain stimulation; DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; CORTICOSUBTHALAMIC INPUT ZONES; MOVEMENT-RELATED CHANGES; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; OSCILLATORY ACTIVITY; CORTICAL OSCILLATIONS; BASAL GANGLIA; MACAQUE MONKEY; BETA-ACTIVITY

Auditory information is then distributed from the core areas to a surrounding belt of about seven areas that are less precisely cochleotopic and generally more responsive to complex stimuli than tones. Recent studies indicate that the belt areas relay to the rostral and caudal divisions of a parabelt region at a third level of processing in the cortex lateral to the belt. The parabelt and belt regions have additional inputs from dorsal and magnocellular divisions of the medial geniculate complex and other parts of the thalamus. The belt and parabelt regions appear to be concerned with integrative and associative functions involved in pattern perception and object recognition. The parabelt fields connect with regions of temporal, parietal, and frontal cortex that mediate additional auditory functions, including space perception and auditory memory.",nan; SINGLE-UNIT ACTIVITY; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL SULCUS; HARMONIC COMPLEX TONES; EVOKED MAGNETIC-FIELDS; TONOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; MACAQUE MONKEYS; AWAKE MONKEY; CORTICAL REPRESENTATION; RESPONSE PATTERNS; SQUIRREL-MONKEY

To assess the input mechanism underlying the surround suppression, we tested the effects of iontophoretically administered GABA(A)-receptor antagonist, bicuculline methiodide (BMI), for the 46 V1 neurons in anesthetized cats. First, the stimulus-size tuning curves were studied, with or without BMI administration, for each neuron by changing the size of the grating patch. During the BMI administration, the shape of the normalized size tuning curve did not change considerably. Second, the dependency of surround suppression on the orientation of the surround grating was examined. In the control, the surround suppression showed the clear orientation tuning that peaked at an orientation the same as the optimal orientation of the CRF response. The BMI administration did not change the orientation dependency of surround suppression. We also estimated the relative contribution of excitation and inhibition to the size and orientation tuning of surround suppression. It was concluded that cortical excitation and inhibition were well balanced, having similar tuning profiles for both stimulus size and orientation of the surround grating. Furthermore, surround stimuli used for V1 neurons suppressed the CRF response of neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus. These results suggest that surround suppression is not primarily attributable to the intracortical inhibition, but because of a reduction of thalamocortical inputs, which drive the cortical excitation and inhibition, and a subsequent decrease in the cortical excitatory interactions.",striate cortex; receptive field surround; surround suppression; bicuculline; intracortical inhibition; lateral geniculate nucleus; cat; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; MACAQUE V1 NEURONS; CLASSICAL RECEPTIVE-FIELD; STRIATE CORTICAL-NEURONS; ORIENTATION SELECTIVITY; SIMPLE CELLS; DIRECTION SELECTIVITY; SYNAPTIC INTEGRATION; SPATIAL SUMMATION; COMPLEX CELLS

However, a largely unexplored area is the nature and existence of cross-modal structural-functional relationships, in which, for example, the volume (or other morphological property) of one brain region is related to the functional response to a given task either in that same brain region, or another brain region. The present study investigated whether the gray matter volume of a selected group of structures (superior, middle, and inferior frontal gyri, thalamus, and hippocampus) was correlated with the fMRI response to a working memory task, within a mask of regions previously identified as involved with working memory. The subjects included individuals with schizophrenia, their siblings, and healthy controls (n = 154 total). Using rigorous permutation testing to define the null distribution, we found that the volume of the superior and middle frontal gyri was correlated with working memory activity within clusters in the intraparietal sulcus (i.e., dorsal parietal cortex) and that the volume of the hippocampus was correlated with working memory activity within clusters in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and left inferior frontal gyrus. However, we did not find evidence that the identified structure-function relationships differed between subject groups. These results show that long-distance structural-functional relationships exist within the human brain. The study of such cross-modal relationships represents an additional approach for studying systems-level interregional brain networks.",Structural MRI; Functional MRI; Working memory; Hippocampus; Prefrontal cortex; Connectivity; MEDIAL TEMPORAL-LOBE; HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; LONG-TERM-MEMORY; HUMAN BRAIN; RHESUS-MONKEY; NONPSYCHOTIC SIBLINGS; SHAPE ABNORMALITIES; UNAFFECTED SIBLINGS; CORTICAL THICKNESS; PERMUTATION TESTS

Using positron emission tomography (PET), we recently showed that the activity in the anterior cingulate cortex (midcingulate area 24a') covaries with the hypnosis-induced reduction of affective and sensory responses to noxious thermal stimulation [Faymonville et al., Anesthesiology 92 (2000) 1257-1267]. In the present study, we assessed changes in cerebral functional connectivity related to the hypnotic state, compared to simple distraction and the resting state. Nineteen highly hypnotizable right-handed volunteers were studied using (H2O)-O-15-PET. The experimental conditions were hot noxious or warm non-noxious stimulation of the right hand during resting state, mental imagery and hypnotic state. Using a psychophysiological interaction analysis, we identified brain areas that would respond to noxious stimulations under the modulatory action of the midcingulate cortex in, and only in, the hypnotic state. Hypnosis, compared to the resting state, reduced pain perception by 50%. Pain perception during rest and mental imagery was not significantly different. Analysis of PET data showed that the hypnotic state, compared to normal alertness (i.e., rest and mental imagery), significantly enhanced the functional modulation between midcingulate cortex and a large neural network encompassing bilateral insula, pregenual anterior cingulate cortex, pre-supplementary motor area, right prefrontal cortex and striatum, thalamus and brainstem. These findings point to a critical role for the midcingulate cortex in the modulation of a large cortical and subcortical network underlying its influence on sensory, affective, Cognitive and behavioral aspects of nociception, in the specific context of hypnosis.

Most of the injured stay in the emergency department for a few hours and are discharged home without a specific follow-up plan because of their negative clinical structural imaging. Advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), particularly functional MRI (fMRI), has been reported as being sensitive to functional disturbances after brain injury. In this study, a cohort of 12 patients with mTBI were prospectively recruited from the emergency department of our local Level-1 trauma center for an advanced MRI scan at the acute stage. Sixteen age- and sex-matched controls were also recruited for comparison. Both group-based and individual-based independent component analysis of resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) demonstrated reduced functional connectivity in both posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and precuneus regions in comparison with controls, which is part of the default mode network (DMN). Further seed-based analysis confirmed reduced functional connectivity in these two regions and also demonstrated increased connectivity between these regions and other regions of the brain in mTBI. Seed-based analysis using the thalamus, hippocampus, and amygdala regions further demonstrated increased functional connectivity between these regions and other regions of the brain, particularly in the frontal lobe, in mTBI. Our data demonstrate alterations of multiple brain networks at the resting state, particularly increased functional connectivity in the frontal lobe, in response to brain concussion at the acute stage. Resting-state functional connectivity of the DMN could serve as a potential biomarker for improved detection of mTBI in the acute setting.",functional connectivity; fMRI; functional MRI; mTBI; mild traumatic brain injury; resting state fMRI; DIFFUSE AXONAL INJURY; POSTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; WHITE-MATTER INJURY; HUMAN AMYGDALA; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; EMERGENCY-DEPARTMENT; FOOTBALL PLAYERS; DEFAULT NETWORK; WORKING-MEMORY

However, some patients can respond to visual stimuli presented in their lesion-affected visual field using residual visual pathways bypassing V1. This phenomenon is called blindsight. Many studies have tried to identify the brain regions responsible for blindsight, and the pulvinar and/or lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) are suggested to play key roles as the thalamic relay of visual signals. However, there are critical problems regarding these preceding studies in that subjects with different sized lesions and periods of time after lesioning were investigated; furthermore, the ability of blindsight was assessed with different measures. In this study, we used double dissociation to clarify the roles of the pulvinar and LGN by pharmacological inactivation of each region and investigated the effects in a simple task with visually guided saccades (VGSs) using monkeys with a unilateral VI lesion, by which nearly all of the contralesional visual field was affected. Inactivating either the ipsilesional pulvinar or LGN impaired VGS toward a visual stimulus in the affected field. In contrast, inactivation of the contralesional pulvinar had no clear effect, but inactivation of the contralesional LGN impaired VGS to the intact visual field. These results suggest that the pulvinar and LGN play key roles in performing the simple VGS task after V1 lesioning, and that the visuomotor functions of blindsight monkeys were supported by plastic changes in the visual pathway involving the pulvinar, which emerged after V1 lesioning.",blindsight; lateral geniculate nucleus; monkey; pulvinar; saccadic eye movement; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; STRIATE CORTEX; MACAQUE; DORSAL; PATHWAY; LESIONS; VISION; DEGENERATION; DEPENDS; NEURONS

Rats in the pseudorandom group were exposed to pseudorandom presentations of the same tone, light and shock stimuli without consistent pairings, Untrained rats in a naive group did not receive presentations of the experimental stimuli. The findings demonstrated that auditory fear conditioning modifies the metabolic neuronal responses of the auditory system, supporting the hypothesis that sensory neurons are responsive to behavioural stimulus properties acquired by learning. There was a clear distinction between thalamocortical and lower divisions of the auditory system based on the differences in metabolic activity evoked by classical conditioning, which lead to an overt learned behavioural response versus pseudorandom stimulus presentations, which lead to behavioural habituation. Increases in cytochrome oxidase activity indicated that tone processing is enhanced during associative conditioning at upper auditory structures (medial geniculate nucleus and secondary auditory cortices). In contrast, metabolic activation of lower auditory structures (cochlear nuclei and inferior colliculus) in response to the pseudorandom presentation of the experimental stimuli suggest that these areas may be activated during habituation to tone stimuli. Together these findings show that mapping the metabolic activity of cytochrome oxidase with quantitative histochemistry can be successfully used to map regional long-lasting effects of learning on brain systems.",auditory cortex; cochlear nucleus; conditioned fear; inferior colliculus; medial geniculate nucleus; quantitative histochemistry; rats; MEDIAL GENICULATE-BODY; RECEPTIVE-FIELD PLASTICITY; RETINAL IMPULSE BLOCKAGE; MACAQUE STRIATE CORTEX; LONG-TERM HABITUATION; INFERIOR COLLICULUS; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; RAT-BRAIN; NETWORK INTERACTIONS

Although the clinical symptoms are well characterized, the pathophysiology of this voice disorder is unknown. We describe here, for the first time to our knowledge, disorder-specific brain abnormalities in these patients as determined by a combined approach of diffusion tensor imaging ( DTI) and postmortem histopathology. We used DTI to identify brain changes and to target those brain regions for neuropathological examination. DTI showed right-sided decrease of fractional anisotropy in the genu of the internal capsule and bilateral increase of overall water diffusivity in the white matter along the corticobulbar/ corticospinal tract in 20 spasmodic dysphonia patients compared to 20 healthy subjects. In addition, water diffusivity was bilaterally increased in the lentiform nucleus, ventral thalamus and cerebellar white and grey matter in the patients. These brain changes were substantiated with focal histopathological abnormalities presented as a loss of axonal density and myelin content in the right genu of the internal capsule and clusters of mineral depositions, containing calcium, phosphorus and iron, in the parenchyma and vessel walls of the posterior limb of the internal capsule, putamen, globus pallidus and cerebellum in the postmortem brain tissue from one patient compared to three controls. The specificity of these brain abnormalities is confirmed by their localization, limited only to the corticobulbar/ corticospinal tract and its main input/ output structures. We also found positive correlation between the diffusivity changes and clinical symptoms of spasmodic dysphonia ( r= 0.509, P= 0.037).

However, recent studies have emphasized that such ongoing activity is strongly synchronized over large cortical distances, and can have a marked impact on the responsiveness of neurons to visual stimuli, suggesting that such activity may indeed be highly relevant to the brain's interpretation of its sensory input. In the current study, we examined the spatiotemporal nature of local field potential (LFP) fluctuations in the visual cortex of two macaque monkeys that were awake, but in a state of relaxation with minimal visual stimulation. Using an array of 16 electrodes spaced by several millimeters, we simultaneously monitored the LFP at many sites over a large region of the visual cortex. In agreement with the literature, we found that the coherence in the raw LFP signal fell off quickly with both frequency and distance. However, when we examined slower fluctuations in the LFP power, we found that. power signals, including those derived from the high gamma-range frequencies, had high coherence that fell off only very slowly with cortical distance. Finally, we performed an additional experiment, with several electrodes placed on either side of a sulcus, to demonstrate that the decline in local field synchrony with cortical distance was so reliable that the interruption in the cortical sheet corresponding to the opening of the sulcus could be easily identified by monitoring just a few minutes of spontaneous LFP activity. These experiments reveal that a significant portion of spontaneous LFP fluctuations in the visual cortex is contributed by global mechanisms, imposing synchrony that is, first and foremost, a function of cortical separation between any two points.",ongoing activity; local field potential; functional magnetic resonance imaging; STRIATE CORTEX; NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; ONGOING ACTIVITY; DYNAMICS; OSCILLATIONS; INTEGRATION; VARIABILITY; THALAMUS; BURST

Regional cerebral glucose metabolism (rCGM) was significantly increased (p < 0.001 uncorrected) during the acute stage in multisensory vestibular cortical and subcortical areas (parietoinsular vestibular cortex in the posterior insula, posterolateral thalamus, anterior cingulate gyrus [Brodmann area 32/24], pontomesencephalic brainstem, hippocampus). Simultaneously, there was a significant rCGM decrease in the visual (Brodmann area 17 to 19) and somatosensory cortex areas in the postcentral gyrus as well as in parts of the auditory cortex (transverse temporal gyrus). Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography thus allows imaging of the cortical activation pattern that is induced by unilateral peripheral vestibular loss. It was possible to demonstrate that the central vestibular system including the vestibular cortex exhibits a visual-vestibular activation-deactivation pattern during the acute stage of vestibular neuritis similar to that in healthy volunteers during unilateral labyrinthine stimulation. Contrary to experimental vestibular stimulation, the activation of the vestibular cortex was not bilateral but was unilateral and contralateral to the right-sided labyrinthine failure.",nan; MONKEYS MACACA-FASCICULARIS; CALORIC STIMULATION; SIGNAL INCREASES; PARIETAL LOBE; CORTEX; BRAIN; REPRESENTATION; ACTIVATION; DECREASES; RESPONSES

Two adult monkeys (Macaca mulatta) were trained to perforin two tasks: tactile discrimination of a change in the texture of a surface presented to digits 3 and 4 and visual discrimination of a change in the intensity of a light. In each trial, standard texture (2 mm spatial period, SP) and visual stimuli were presented. These were followed by an increase in SP and/or luminance. Each trial was preceded by an instruction cue (colored light) that directed the animal to attend and respond to the change in one modality while ignoring any change in the other modality. The two tasks were interleaved during the recording, on a trial-by-trial basis. Extracellular recordings were made from 178 neurons (SI, 102; SII, 76), all with a cutaneous receptive field on the stimulated digit tips. Discharge was quantified in both tasks during the instruction, the standard-stimuli, and the texture-change periods. The results showed that selective attention to tactile stimuli had qualitatively and quantitatively greater and earlier effects in SII than SI. Twenty-four of 102 SI cells showed a significant change in discharge with the direction of attention. For almost all cells (20/24), discharge was enhanced when attention was directed toward the tactile stimuli; the effects were most frequent in the analysis interval that encompassed the change in SP (16/24). A significantly higher proportion of SII cells were attention-sensitive (47/76). The effects were concentrated in the texture-change period (39/47) but also included earlier periods in the trial (instruction period, n = 15; standard-stimuli period, n = 32). Attention-related modulation that spanned all three intervals (n = 11) likely reflected baseline changes in discharge. For the texture-sensitive cells (43 in SI, 37 in SII), the mean change in discharge frequency (post texture change - pre-texture change) in each task was significantly increased in SII but not SI with selective attention. The results are consistent with a two-stage modulation of parietal cortical discharge, an initial stage (SI) in which there is some enhancement of sensory responses to the salient feature, the texture change, and a second stage (SII) in which baseline changes occur, along with further feature selection. These controls may be independently exerted on SI and SII, or they may reflect top-down controls from SII to SI.",nan; PASSIVE TEXTURE-DISCRIMINATION; MACAQUE VISUAL-CORTEX; THALAMIC VPM NUCLEUS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION; DISCHARGE PROPERTIES; NEURAL MECHANISMS; VIBROTACTILE STIMULI; PARIETAL CORTEX; BEHAVING MONKEY; RHESUS-MONKEYS

Parvalbumin-IR neurons are present in layers II-VI of the macaque principal sulcus (Walker's area 46) and are concentrated in a band centered around layer IV. PV-IR cells are exclusively non-pyramidal in shape and are morphologically heterogeneous with soma sizes ranging from less than 10-mu-m to greater than 20-mu-m. Well-labeled neurons that could be classified on the basis of soma size and dendritic configuration resembled large basket and chandelier cells. A novel finding is that supragranular PV-IR neurons exhibit dendritic patterns with predominantly vertical orientations, whereas infragranular cells exhibit mostly horizontal or oblique dendritic orientations. PV-IR cells within layer IV exhibit a mixture of dendritic arrangements. Vertical rows of PV-IR puncta, 15-30-mu-m in length, resembling the cartridges of chandelier cell axons were most dense in layers II, superficial III, and the granular layer IV but were not observed in the infragranular layers. Cartridges were often present beneath unlabeled, presumed pyramidal cells. PV-IR puncta also formed pericellular nests around pyramidal cell somata and proximal dendrites, suggestive of basket cell innervation. PV-IR axons were occasionally observed in the white matter underlying the principal sulcus. Electron microscopic analysis revealed that PV-IR somata and dendrites are densely innervated by nonimmunoreactive terminals forming asymmetric (Gray type I) synapses as well as by fewer terminals forming symmetric (Gray type II) synapses. The majority of terminals forming symmetric synapses with PV-IR post-synaptic structures were not immunolabeled; however, some of these boutons did contain PV-immunoreactivity. PV-IR boutons exclusively form symmetric synapses and heavily innervate layer II/III pyramidal cells. PV-IR axon cartridges formed numerous axo-axonic synapses with the axon initial segments of pyramidal cells 15-20-mu-m beneath the axon hillock and also terminated on large axonal spines of the initial segment. Furthermore, we failed to observe a mixture of PV-immunoreactive and non-immunoreactive boutons composing a single axon cartridge. Pyramidal cell somata and proximal dendrites were also heavily innervated by PV-IR boutons forming symmetric synapses, again, consistent with basket cell innervation. In addition, PV-IR axon terminals frequently formed symmetric synapses with dendritic shafts and spines of unidentified neurons. Invariably, dendritic spines contacted by PV-IR boutons were also contacted by non-immunoreactive boutons forming asymmetric synapses, i.e., a triadic synaptic arrangement. Thus, the PV-immunolabeled subset of non-pyramidal cells, and possibly extra-cortical PV-IR afferents of the prefrontal cortex, heavily innervate both the input and output portions of layer II/III pyramidal cells and are therefore capable of extensive modulation of the excitability of associational and commissural neurons.",CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEINS; CHANDELIER CELLS; BASKET CELLS; CEREBRAL CORTEX; AXON INITIAL SEGMENT; CALCIUM-BINDING PROTEINS; SOMATIC SENSORY CORTEX; CHANDELIER CELL AXONS; RAT CEREBRAL-CORTEX; VISUAL-CORTEX; PYRAMIDAL CELLS; COMBINED GOLGI; ELECTRON-MICROSCOPE; GABAERGIC NEURONS; THALAMIC NUCLEI

A relatively homogeneous subject group was obtained using criteria for familial pure depressive disease (FPDD), which are based upon family history as well as upon symptoms and course. Because of the absence of certain knowledge about the pathophysiology of mood disorders and their underlying functional neuroanatomy, we used data obtained from the subtraction of composite images from one-half of depressed and control subjects to identify candidate regions of interest. The major cortical region defined in this manner was statistically tested on a second set of subjects. Using this strategy, we found increased BF in an area that extended from the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex onto the medial prefrontal cortical surface. Based upon the connectivity between these portions of the prefrontal cortex and the amygdala and evidence that the amygdala is involved in emotional modulation, activity was measured in the left amygdala and found to be significantly increased in the depressed group. A separate group of subjects with FPDD who were currently asymptomatic were also imaged to determine whether these findings represented abnormalities associated with the depressed state, or with a trait difference that might underlie the tendency to become depressed. Only the depressed group had increased activity in the left prefrontal cortex, suggesting that this abnormality represents a state marker of FPDD. Both the depressed and the remitted groups demonstrated increased activity in the left amygdala, though this difference achieved significance only in the depressed group. This suggests that the abnormality involving the left amygdala may represent a trait marker of FPDD, though further assessment in a larger sample size is necessary to establish this. These data along with other evidence suggest that a circuit involving the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and related parts of the striatum, pallidum, and medial thalamus is involved in the functional neuroanatomy of depression.",nan; POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; CEREBRAL BLOOD-FLOW; MEDIODORSAL THALAMIC NUCLEUS; BASAL GANGLIA; GLUCOSE-UTILIZATION; AFFECTIVE-DISORDERS; METABOLIC RATES; FOREBRAIN STRUCTURES; MACACA-FASCICULARIS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE

The functional anatomy of the cerebral cortex implicated in vision is reviewed with the purpose of illustrating the complexity of the cortical processing in visual perception. Development. A brief analysis of the retinogeniculocortical pathway is presented and a summary of the main findings of the physiological and anatomical studies of Hubel and Wiesel in the adult brain is also illustrated. Special attention is paid in showing the visual pathways for object and face recognition as well as spatial cognition. Conclusions. Visual cortical areas in primates and man can be divided roughly into a ventral stream in relation with the temporal lobe responsible for the processing and storage of information about the identity of objects, their shape, color, and other salient physical features; and a dorsal stream in relation with the parietal lobe and concerned with the analysis of the locations of objects, and their movements in space. These two cortical pathways are not totally segregated and both are related to the prefrontal cortex as,well as others subcortical structures such as the thalamus, the basal ganglia, the superior colliculus and the cerebellum through the pontine nuclei.",cerebral cortex; cortical lesions; occipital cortex; parietal cortex; temporal cortex; visual system; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; HUMAN EXTRASTRIATE CORTEX; OCULAR DOMINANCE COLUMNS; MACAQUE MONKEY; REVEALS; AREAS; ORGANIZATION; ORIENTATION; EXPLORATION; MOVEMENTS

Little is known about the parieto-insular vestibular cortex (PIVC), an area of the cortex with prominent vestibular inputs. Neural activity was recorded in the PIVC of rhesus macaques during combinations of head, body, and visual target rotations. Activity of many PIVC neurons was correlated with the motion of the head in space (vestibular), the twist of the neck (proprioceptive), and the motion of a visual target, but was not associated with eye movement. PIVC neurons responded most commonly to more than one stimulus, and responses to combined movements could often be approximated by a combination of the individual sensitivities to head, neck, and target motion. The pattern of visual, vestibular, and somatic sensitivities on PIVC neurons displayed a continuous range, with some cells strongly responding to one or two of the stimulus modalities while other cells responded to any type of motion equivalently. The PIVC contains multisensory convergence of self-motion cues with external visual object motion information, such that neurons do not represent a specific transformation of any one sensory input. Instead, the PIVC neuron population may define the movement of head, body, and external visual objects in space and relative to one another. This comparison of self and external movement is consistent with insular cortex functions related to monitoring and explains many disparate findings of previous studies.",insula; multisensory; self-motion; sensory integration; spatial orientation; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; VISUAL-MOTION PERCEPTION; SELF-MOTION; CORTICAL CONNECTIONS; SOMATOSENSORY FIELDS; THALAMUS NEURONS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; SMOOTH-PURSUIT; NEURAL BASIS; RESPONSES

In order to understand how mutations in the NF1 gene impact brain structure it is essential to characterize in detail the brain structural abnormalities in patients with NF1. Previous studies have reported contradictory findings and have focused only on volumetric measurements. Here, we investigated the volumes of subcortical structures and the composite dimensions of the cortex through analysis of cortical volume, cortical thickness, cortical surface area and gyrification. Methods: We studied 14 children with NF1 and 14 typically developing children matched for age, gender, IQ and right/left-handedness. Regional subcortical volumes and cortical gyral measurements were obtained using the FreeSurfer software. Between-group differences were evaluated while controlling for the increase in total intracranial volume observed in NF1. Results: Subcortical analysis revealed disproportionately larger thalami, right caudate and middle corpus callosum in patients with NF1. Cortical analyses on volume, thickness and surface area were however not indicative of significant alterations in patients. Interestingly, patients with NF1 had significantly lower gyrification indices than typically developing children primarily in the frontal and temporal lobes, but also affecting the insula, cingulate cortex, parietal and occipital regions. Conclusions: The neuroanatomic abnormalities observed were localized to specific brain regions, indicating that particular areas might constitute selective targets for NF1 gene mutations. Furthermore, the lower gyrification indices were accompanied by a disproportionate increase in brain size without the corresponding increase in folding in patients with NF1. Taken together these findings suggest that specific neurodevelopmental processes, such as gyrification, are more vulnerable to NF1 dysfunction than others. The identified changes in brain organization are consistent with the patterns of cognitive dysfunction in the NF1 phenotype.",Brain structure; Gyrification; Morphometry; MRI; Neurodevelopmental disorders; Neurofibromatosis type 1; CORPUS-CALLOSUM MORPHOLOGY; GTPASE-ACTIVATING PROTEIN; HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; GEOMETRICALLY ACCURATE; COGNITIVE FUNCTION; GENETIC INFLUENCES; RHESUS-MONKEY; BRAIN VOLUME; CHILDREN; THICKNESS

Explorations of the underlying neural mechanisms have reported a gradual increase or decrease in neuronal activity prior to self-timed movements within the cortico-basal ganglia loop. Previous studies in both humans and animals have shown that endogenous dopamine (DA) plays a modulatory role in self-timing. However, the specific site of dopaminergic regulation remains elusive because the systemic application of DA-related substances can directly alter both cortical and subcortical neuronal activities. To investigate the role of striatal DA in self-timing, we locally injected DA receptor agonists or antagonists into the striatum of two female monkeys (Macaca fuscata) while they performed two versions of the memory-guided saccade (MS) task. In the conventional, triggered MS task, animals made a saccade to the location of a previously flashed visual cue in response to the fixation point offset. In the self-timed MS task, monkeys were rewarded for making a self-initiated saccade within a predetermined time interval following the cue. Infusion of a small amount of a D-1 or D-2 antagonist led to early saccades in the self-timed, but not the triggered MS tasks, while infusion of DA agonists produced no consistent effect. We also found that local administration of nicotinic but not muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonists and antagonists altered the timing of self-initiated saccades. Our data suggest that the timing of self-initiated movements may be regulated by the balance of signals in the direct and indirect basal ganglia pathways, as well as that between both hemispheres of the brain.

In the healthy brain, somatosensory, visual, and auditory input proceeds through neocortical core and belt fields to a variety of association areas, and from here the data is transported via long cortico-cortical pathways to the extended prefrontal association cortex. Tracts generated from this highest organizational level of the brain guide the data via the frontal belt (premotor cortex) to the frontal core (primary motor area). The striatal and cerebellar loops provide the major routes for this data transfer. The main components of the limbic system (the hippocampal formation, the entorhinal region, and the amygdala) maintain a strategic position between the sensory and the motor association areas. Part of the stream of data from the sensory association areas to the prefrontal cortex branches off and eventually converges on the entorhinal region and the amygdala. These connections establish the afferent leg of the Limbic loop. In addition, the limbic centers receive substantial input from nuclei processing viscerosensory information. The entorhinal region, the hippocampal formation, and the amygdala are densely interconnected. Important among these connections is the perforant path, which originates in the entorhinal cortex and projects to the hippocampal formation (fascia dentata, Ammon's horn, and subiculum). The subiculum projects to the amygdala, entorhinal region, mamillary nuclei, and anterior and midline thalamic nuclei. The hippocampal formation, the entorhinal region, and the amygdala generate the efferent leg of the Limbic loop, which is directed toward the prefrontal cortex. Additional projections reach the key nuclei that control endocrine and autonomic functions. Furthermore, the amygdala exerts influence on all nonthalamic nuclei projecting in a nonspecific manner to the cerebral cortex (ie, the cholinergic magnocellular forebrain nuclei, the histaminergic tuberomamillary nucleus, the dopaminergic nuclei of the ventral tegmentum, the serotonergic anterior raphe nuclei, and the noradrenergic locus ceruleus). The limbic loop centers thus are in the unique strategic position to perform integration of exteroceptive sensory data of various sources with interoceptive stimuli from autonomic centers. Their efferent projections exert influence on both the prefrontal association cortex and the key centers controlling endocrine and autonomic functions.",nan; BINDING PROTEIN CALBINDIN-D28K; LAMINA-SPECIFIC PATHOLOGY; NUCLEUS-REUNIENS-THALAMI; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; HUMAN-BRAIN; PARVALBUMIN IMMUNOCYTOCHEMISTRY; CHOLINE-ACETYLTRANSFERASE; MACACA-FASCICULARIS; HUMAN HYPOTHALAMUS

In studies addressing these issues in young non-human primates, investigators have used positron emission tomography (PET) and [F-18]2-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG) to calculate local cerebral metabolic rates of glucose (ICMRGlc). Unfortunately, these values were influenced by anesthesia. In order to avoid this confounding factor, we have established a method that permits reliable measurements in young conscious vervet monkeys using FDG-PET. Immature animals remained in a conscious, resting state during the initial 42 min of FDG uptake as they were allowed to cling to their anesthetized mothers. After FDG uptake, animals were anesthetized and placed in the PET scanner with data acquisition beginning at 60 min post-FDG injection. FDG image sets consisted of 30 planes separated by 1.69 mm, parameters sufficient to image the entire monkey brain. Our method of region-of-interest (ROI) analysis was assessed within and between raters and demonstrated high reliability (P < 0.001). To illustrate that our method was sensitive to developmental changes in cerebral glucose metabolism, quantitative studies of young conscious monkeys revealed that infant monkeys 6-8 months of age exhibited significantly higher ICMRGlc values (P < 0.05) in all regions examined, except sensorimotor cortex and thalamus, compared to monkeys younger than 4 months of age. This method provided high resolution images and ICMRGlc values that were reliable within age group. These results support the application of FDG-PET to investigate questions related to cerebral glucose metabolism in young conscious non-human primates. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

Under this framework, we aimed to investigate the functional specialization of the human cingulate cortex by analyzing the resting-state functional connectivity (FC) of each subregion from a network perspective. In 20 healthy subjects we systematically investigated the FC patterns of the bilateral subgenual (sACC) and pregenual (pACC) anterior cingulate cortices, anterior (aMCC) and posterior (pMCC) midcingulate cortices, dorsal (dPCC) and ventral (vPCC) posterior cingulate cortices and retrosplenial cortices (RSC). We found that each cingulate subregion was specifically integrated in the predescribed functional networks and showed anti-correlated resting-state fluctuations. The sACC and pACC were involved in an affective network and anti-correlated with the sensorimotor and cognitive networks, while the pACC also correlated with the default-mode network and anti-correlated with the visual network. In the midcingulate cortex, however, the aMCC was correlated with the cognitive and sensorimotor networks and anti-correlated with the visual, affective and default-mode networks, whereas the pMCC only correlated with the sensorimotor network and anti-correlated with the cognitive and visual networks. The dPCC and vPCC involved in the default-mode network and anti-correlated with the sensorimotor, cognitive and visual networks, in contrast, the RSC was mainly correlated with the PCC and thalamus. Based on a strong hypothesis driven approach of anatomical partitions of the cingulate cortex, we could confirm their segregation in terms of functional neuroanatomy, as suggested earlier by task studies or exploratory multi-seed investigations.

Objectives: To identify the sites of action of ketamine in inducing symptoms and to determine the role of increased glutamate release using the glutamate release inhibitor lamotrigine. Design: Two experiments with different participants were performed using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover, counterbalanced-order design. In the first experiment, the effect of intravenous ketamine hydrochloride on regional blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signal and correlated symptoms was compared with intravenous saline placebo. In the second experiment, pretreatment with lamotrigine was compared with placebo to identify which effects of ketamine are mediated by increased glutamate release. Setting: Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility, Manchester, England. Participants: Thirty-three healthy, right-handed men were recruited by advertisements. Interventions: In experiment 1, participants were given intravenous ketamine (1-minute bolus of 0.26 mg/ kg, followed by a maintenance infusion of 0.25 mg/ kg/ h for the remainder of the session) or placebo (0.9% saline solution). In experiment 2, participants were pretreated with 300 mg of lamotrigine or placebo and then were given the same doses of ketamine as in experiment 1. Main Outcome Measures: Regional BOLD signal changes during ketamine or placebo infusion and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and Clinician- Administered Dissociative States Scale scores. Results: Ketamine induced a rapid, focal, and unexpected decrease in ventromedial frontal cortex, including orbitofrontal cortex and subgenual cingulate, which strongly predicted its dissociative effects and increased activity in mid- posterior cingulate, thalamus, and temporal cortical regions (r= 0.90). Activations correlated with Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale psychosis scores. Lamotrigine pretreatment prevented many of the BOLD signal changes and the symptoms. Conclusions: These 2 changes may underpin 2 fundamental processes of psychosis: abnormal perceptual experiences and impaired cognitive- emotional evaluation of their significance. The results are compatible with the theory that the neural and subjective effects of ketamine involve increased glutamate release.",nan; HEALTHY-VOLUNTEERS; POSTERIOR CINGULATE; M-CHLOROPHENYLPIPERAZINE; PHARMACOKINETIC MODEL; FUNCTIONAL MRI; BRAIN ACTIVITY; RHESUS-MONKEY; BLOOD-FLOW; SCHIZOPHRENIA; PSYCHOSIS

Intracortical responses were analysed in two latency ranges: 0-50 ms and 50-150 ms after stimulus. In all patients, we recorded in the first 50 ms after stimulus two positive P14 and P20 potentials followed by a N30 negativity. In the hemisphere contralateral to stimulation, the P20-N30 potentials showed a clear amplitude decrease from the outer to the inner aspect of the frontal lobe with minimal amplitudes in the pre-SMA. In the hemisphere ipsilateral to stimulus, P20 and N30 amplitudes were decreasing from mesial to lateral frontal cortex. In the 50-150 ms latency range, contacts implanted in the pre-SMA recorded a negative potential in the 60-70 ms latency range which, in five patients, was followed by a positive response peaking 80-110 ms after stimulus. These potentials were not picked up by more superficial contacts. We conclude that no early SEP is generated in pre-SMA in the first 50 ms after stimulation, while some potentials peaking in the 60-100 ms after stimulus are likely to originate from this cortical area. The latency of the pre-SMA responses recorded in our patients supports the hypothesis that the pre-SMA does not receive short-latency somatosensory inputs via direct thalamocortical projections. More probably the pre-SMA receives somatosensory inputs mediated by a polysynaptic transcortical transmission through functionally secondary motor and somatosensory areas.",frontal lobe; intracerebral recordings; somatosensory-evoked potentials; supplementary motor area; CEREBRAL BLOOD-FLOW; ADJACENT CINGULATE CORTEX; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; VOLUNTARY MOVEMENTS; MACAQUE MONKEY; INTRACORTICAL MICROSTIMULATION; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; SENSORIMOTOR AREA; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; CORTICAL SURFACE

Correlated firing has been linked to stimulus encoding(9), attention(11), stimulus discrimination(4), and motor behaviour(12). Nevertheless, the mechanisms underlying correlated spiking are poorly understood(2,3,13-20), and its coding implications are still debated(13,16,21,22). It is not clear, for instance, whether correlations between the discharges of two neurons are determined solely by the correlation between their afferent currents, or whether they also depend on the mean and variance of the input. We addressed this question by computing the spike train correlation coefficient of unconnected pairs of in vitro cortical neurons receiving correlated inputs. Notably, even when the input correlation remained fixed, the spike train output correlation increased with the firing rate, but was largely independent of spike train variability. With a combination of analytical techniques and numerical simulations using 'integrate- and- fire' neuron models we show that this relationship between output correlation and firing rate is robust to input heterogeneities. Finally, this overlooked relationship is replicated by a standard threshold- linear model, demonstrating the universality of the result. This connection between the rate and correlation of spiking activity links two fundamental features of the neural code.",nan; PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; VISUAL-CORTEX; DISCHARGE; CELLS; SYNCHRONIZATION; COMPUTATION; POPULATION; MACAQUE; INPUT; WEAK

The human LGN is composed mainly of magnocellular (M) and parvocellular (P) subdivisions, each of which has different stimulus selectivity in neural response properties. Previous studies have discussed the potential relationship between LGN subdivisions and visual disorders based on psychophysical data on specific types of visual stimuli. However, these relationships remain speculative because non-invasive measurements of these subdivisions are difficult due to the small size of the LGN. Here we propose a method to identify these subdivisions by combining two structural MR measures: high-resolution proton-density weighted images and macromolecular tissue volume (MTV) maps. We defined the M and P subdivisions based on MTV fraction data and tested the validity of the definition by (1) comparing the data with that from human histological studies, (2) comparing the data with functional magnetic resonance imaging measurements on stimulus selectivity, and (3) analyzing the test-retest reliability. The findings demonstrated that the spatial organization of the M and P subdivisions was consistent across subjects and in line with LGN subdivisions observed in human histological data. Moreover, the difference in stimulus selectivity between the subdivisions identified using MTV was consistent with previous physiology literature. The definition of the subdivisions based on MTV was shown to be robust over measurements taken on different days. These results suggest that MTV mapping is a promising approach for evaluating the tissue properties of LGN subdivisions in living humans. This method potentially will enable neuroscientific and clinical hypotheses about the human LGN subdivisions to be tested.",Lateral geniculate nucleus; Magnocellular; Parvocellular; Structural MRI; Functional MRI; Visual system; SPATIAL ATTENTION; MYELIN CONTENT; VISUAL-CORTEX; FMRI; GLAUCOMA; LAYER; REGISTRATION; MORPHOMETRY; PERFORMANCE; PHYSIOLOGY

This large fiber bundle is abnormal in several psychiatric illnesses and a major target for deep brain stimulation. Yet, we have very little information about where specific prefrontal fibers travel within the bundle. Using a combination of tracing studies and diffusion MRI in male nonhuman primates, as well as diffusion MRI in male and female human subjects, we segmented the human ALIC into five regions based on the positions of axons from different cortical regions within the capsule. Fractional anisotropy (FA) abnormalities in patients with bipolar disorder were detected when FA was averaged in the ALIC segment that carries ventrolateral prefrontal cortical connections. Together, the results set the stage for linking abnormalities within the ALIC to specific connections and demonstrate the utility of applying connectivity profiles of large white matter bundles based on animal anatomic studies to human connections and associating disease abnormalities in those pathways with specific connections.

Spinothalamic tract (STT) neurons in the C3-T6 spinal segments were studied for their responses to stimulation of phrenic and cardiopulmonary spinal afferent fibers. A total of 142 STT neurons were studied in 44 anesthetized, paralyzed monkeys (Macaca fascicularis). All neurons were antidromically activated from the ventroposterolateral nucleus and/or medial thalamus. 2. Electrical stimulation of phrenic afferent fibers (PHR) excited 43/58 (74%), inhibited 2/58 (3%), and did not affect 13/58 (13%) of cervical STT neurons. Neurons with excitatory somatic fields confined to the proximal limb or encompassing the whole limb were excited to a significantly greater extent by electrical stimulation of PHR than were neurons with somatic fields confined to the distal limb. Mechanical stimulation of PHR by probing the exposed diaphragm excited 11/22 (50%), inhibited 3/22 (14%), and did not affect 8/22 (36%) cervical STT neurons. 3. The technique of minimum afferent conduction velocity (MACV) was used to obtain information about the identity of the PHR that excited 35 cervical STT neurons. Evidence was obtained for excitation of these neurons by group II and III PHR. The mean +/- SE MACV for all neurons was 14 +/- 2 m/s. 4. Electrical stimulation of cardiopulmonary spinal afferent fibers excited 41/57 (72%), inhibited 8/57 (14%), and did not affect 8/57 (14%) of cervical STT neurons. Neurons with excitatory somatic fields confined to the proximal limb or encompassing the whole limb were excited to a significantly greater extent by electrical stimulation of cardiopulmonary spinal afferents than were neurons with somatic fields confined to the distal limb. 5. Excitatory convergence of PHR and cardiopulmonary spinal afferent input was observed for 36/57 (63%) cervical STT neurons. 6. Electrical stimulation of PHR excited 36/84 (43%), inhibited 25/84 (30%), and did not affect 23/84 (27%) of thoracic STT neurons. All of these neurons received excitatory cardiopulmonary spinal afferent input. 7. Neurons were more likely to be excited by electrical stimulation of PHR if they were located in C3-C6 spinal segments. Furthermore, the net excitatory effect of PHR input decreased in more caudal segments, such that thoracic STT neurons were weakly excited relative to cervical STT neurons. 8. We conclude that cervical STT neurons with excitatory somatic fields that include or are restricted to proximal sites are excited by electrical or mechanical stimulation of PHR. Those effects demonstrate a physiological substrate for pain referred from the diaphragm to the shoulder in patients with pleural effusions or subphrenic abscesses. Excitatory convergence of PHR and cardiopulmonary spinal afferent input on cervical STT neurons is consistent with the fact that referred pain fields in cardiac and diaphragmatic diseases can include cervical dermatomes. However, the restricted referred pain fields observed in patients with diaphragmatic pain cannot be entirely explained by somatic field sizes of cervical or thoracic STT neurons. We propose that, in addition to input from the STT, dorsal column input to supra-spinal sites may be important in refining the extent of referred pain fields in diseases involving the diaphragm.",nan; NOXIOUS THERMAL-STIMULATION; NERVE AFFERENTS; DORSAL HORN; BODY REPRESENTATION; CAT; RESPONSES; CELLS; INPUTS; MUSCLE; CORD

Capsaicin treatment produced activation in many discrete brain regions which we classified as subserving four main functions: sensation-perception (primary somatosensory cortex, thalamus and insula); attention (anterior cingulate cortex); descending pain control (periaqueductal grey); and an extensive network related to sensory-motor integration (supplementary motor cortex, bilateral putamen and insula, anterior lobe and vermis of the cerebellum and superior colliculus), Comparison of the noxious and non-noxious stimuli yielded several new insights into neural organization of pain and tactile sensations. Capsaicin pain, which had no concomitant tactile component, produced little or no activation in secondary somatosensory cortex (SII), whereas light brushing produced a prominent activation of SII, suggesting a differential sensitivity of Sn: to tactile versus painful stimuli. The cerebellar vermis was strongly activated by capsaicin, whereas light brush and experimental allodynia produced little or no activation, suggesting a selective association with C-fibre stimulation and nociceptive second-order spinal neurons. The experimental allodynia activated a network that partially overlapped those activated by both pain and light brush alone. Unlike capsaicin-induced pain, allodynia was characterized by bilateral activation of inferior prefrontal cortex, suggesting that prefrontal responses to pain are context dependent.",nociception; neuropathic pain; capsaicin; regional cerebral blood flow; neuroimaging; POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; NEUROGENIC HYPERALGESIA; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; NEUROPATHIC PAIN; CLIMBING FIBERS; RHESUS-MONKEY; HUMAN BRAIN; NEURONS

We investigated this issue using functional magnetic resonance imaging and virtual reality contexts. Subjects underwent differential context conditioning in which they were repeatedly exposed to two contexts (CXT+ and CXT-) in semirandom order, with contexts counterbalanced across participants. An unsignaled footshock was consistently paired with the CXT+, and no shock was ever delivered in the CXT-. Evidence for context conditioning was established using skin conductance and anxiety ratings. Consistent with animal models centrally implicating the hippocampus and amygdala in a network supporting context conditioning, CXT+ compared with CXT-significantly activated right anterior hippocampus and bilateral amygdala. In addition, context conditioning was associated with activation in posterior orbitofrontal cortex, medial dorsal thalamus, anterior insula, subgenual anterior cingulate, and parahippocampal, inferior frontal, and parietal cortices. Structural equation modeling was used to assess interactions among the core brain regions mediating context conditioning. The derived model indicated that medial amygdala was the source of key efferent and afferent connections including input from orbitofrontal cortex.

Cadaveric allografts are one potential reconstructive material, but their use requires systemic immunosuppression. Cold preservation (7 weeks) renders allografts devoid of antigens, but these acellular substrates generally fail in supporting regeneration beyond 3 cm. In this study, the authors evaluated the reconstruction of extensive nonhuman primate peripheral nerve defects using 7-week cold-preserved allografts repopulated with cultured autologous Schwann cells. Methods: Ten outbred Macaca fascicularis primates were paired based on maximal genetic disparity as measured by similarity index assay. A total of 14 ulnar nerve defects measuring 6 cm were successfully reconstructed using autografts (n = 5), fresh allografts (n = 2), cold-preserved allografts (n = 3), or cold-preserved allografts seeded with autogenous Schwann cells (n 4). Recipient immunoreactivity was evaluated by means of enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot assay, and nerves were harvested at 6 months for histologic and histomorphometric analysis. Results: Cytokine production in response to cold-preserved allografts and cold-preserved allografts seeded with autologous Schwann cells was similar to that observed for autografts. Schwann cell-repopulated cold-preserved grafts demonstrated significantly enhanced fiber counts, nerve density, and percentage nerve (p < 0.05) compared with unseeded cold-preserved grafts at 6 months after reconstruction. Conclusions: Cold-preserved allografts seeded with autologous Schwann cells were well-tolerated in unrelated recipients and supported significant regeneration across 6-cm peripheral nerve defects. Use of cold-preserved allogeneic nerve tissue supplemented with autogenous Schwarm cells poses a potentially safe and effective alternative to the use of autologous tissue in the reconstruction of extensive nerve injuries.",nan; GROWTH-FACTOR RECEPTOR; RAT THALAMIC AXONS; NEUROTROPHIC FACTOR; SCIATIC-NERVE; BASAL LAMINA; EXTRACELLULAR-MATRIX; FUNCTIONAL RECOVERY; MOLECULAR-BASIS; RE-INNERVATION; MESSENGER-RNA

MAP 2-immunostained neurons are present through the depth of area 17 but are most intensely immunoreactive in layers IVB and VI. From layer IVB, separate groups of MAP 2-positive cells invade layers IVA and IVCalpha. Clusters of cells protrude upward from superficial layer IVB and occupy the central core regions of the cytochrome oxidase (CO)-stained honeycomb in layer IVA, while large neurons typical of layer IVB are distributed in irregular clusters in the subjacent layer IVCalpha. The somata in the layer IVA honeycomb cores give off immunostained dendrites which remain largely within the core regions. Patches of MAP 2-positive neurons are also present in layers II and III, where they coincide with the CO-stained puffs. Intravitreal injections of tetrodotoxin (TTX) into one eye of adult monkeys produce stripes of alternating light and dark MAP 2 immunostaining in layer IVC. Stripes of light immunostaining coincide with stripes of light CO staining, and correspond to reduced MAP 2 immunoreactivity within cortical neurons dominated by the TTX-injected eye. In layers II and III, the MAP 2 immunostaining of patches overlying the injected-eye columns is similarly reduced. No change occurs in the MAP 2 immunostaining of layer IVA. These data suggest that the anatomical and physiological heterogeneity of layers IVA and IVCalpha arises from the periodic invasion of neurons characteristic of layer IVB, that the neurons in layer IVA have dendrites confined to thalamocortical-recipient or nonrecipient zones and that the expression of MAP 2 changes in adult cortical neurons following the loss of retinal input.",DENDRITES; CYTOSKELETON; STRIATE CORTEX; PYRAMIDAL CELLS; MACAQUE STRIATE CORTEX; GLUTAMIC-ACID DECARBOXYLASE; OCULAR DOMINANCE COLUMNS; FUNCTIONAL-ANATOMY; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; NEUROPEPTIDE-Y; AREA 17; MONOCLONAL-ANTIBODY; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; MONOCULAR DEPRIVATION

Attention seems to have a reciprocal relation with binding, inasmuch as the latter promotes the composition of features and their dependencies, while the former selects a single characteristic independently of the remainder. Classically, binding is viewed as a process whereby sets of properties are gathered in representative entities, which are themselves linked to form higher level structures, in a sequence that culminates in the total integration of the pattern features in a localized construct. The convergent axonal projections from one cortical area to another would be the neurobiological mechanism through which binding is achieved. Attention comprises the selective excitation of neuronal networks or pathways that stand for specific pattern properties. The thalamus and its reticular nucleus would then be the anatomical substrate of the attentional focus. In this paper we propose a computational model aiming at bringing together the main (and apparently diverging) ideas about binding and attention. Based on experimental data, a neuronal network representing cortical pyramidal cells is assembled, and its structure and function are related to the binding and attention phenomena. Actually, the convergent projections that enlarge the visual receptive field are associated to binding, while a specific change in the pyramidal cell behavior is responsible for attention. Computer simulations are shown which reproduce the electrophysiology of pyramidal cells and mimic some interesting experimental results in visual attention. We conclude by conjecturing that attention is a driven interruption in the regular process of binding.",NEURONAL MODELING; VISUAL ATTENTION; PYRAMIDAL CELLS; NEOCORTICAL NEURONS; CORTEX; MACAQUE; INVITRO; MONKEY

The anterior and posterior parts of the BMA, recognized on cytoarchitectonic grounds, display very different projection patterns. Within the amygdala, the anterior basomedial nucleus (BMAa) heavily innervates the central, medial, and anterior cortical nuclei. In contrast, the posterior basomedial nucleus (BMAp) sends a dense projection to the lateral nucleus, and to restricted parts of the central and medial nuclei. Extra-amygdalar projections from the BMA are divided into ascending and descending components. The former end in the cerebral cortex, striatum, and septum. The BMAa mainly innervates olfactory (piriform, transitional) and insular areas, whereas the BMAp also innervates inferior temporal (perirhinal, ectorhinal) and medial prefrontal (infralimbic, prelimbic) areas and the hippocampal formation. Within the striatum, the BMAa densely innervates the striatal fundus, whereas the nucleus accumbens receives a heavy input from the BMAp. Both parts of the BMA send massive projections to distinct regions of the bed nuclei of the stria terminalis. Descending projections from the BMA end primarily in the hypothalamus. The BMAa sends a major input to the lateral hypothalamic area, whereas the BMAp innervates the ventromedial nucleus particularly heavily. Injections were also placed in the anterior cortical nucleus (COAa), a cell group superficially adjacent to the BMAa. PHAL-labeled axons from this cell group mainly ascend into the amygdala and olfactory areas, and descend into the thalamus and lateral hypothalamic area. Based on connections, the COAa and BMAa are part of the same functional system. The results suggest that cytoarchitectonically distinct anterior and posterior parts of the BMA are also hodologically distinct and form parts of distinct anatomical circuits probably involved in mediating different behaviors (for example, feeding and social behaviors vs. emotion-related learning, respectively).

Neverthelss, the available functional and anatomical evidence linking together specific cell types across these structures is surprisingly indirect. This review evaluates the available evidence and assesses the strength of the many inferences that can be made from these observations. There is strong evidence that parasol RGCs are the provenance of the magnocellular (M) visual pathway and that midget RGCs give rise to the parvocellular (P) pathway. Furthermore, the M and P pathways remain segregated up to the input layer of primary visual cortex. The relationships between the numerous other RGC types and cell types in the LGN remain less certain. and there remains ambiguity about how best to define additional pathways, such as the koniocellular (K) pathway, which probably arise from these other, less common, RGC types.",nan; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; STRIATE CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; WORLD MONKEY; OLD-WORLD; S-CONE; MORPHOLOGY; COLOR

The subplate is a largely transient cortical structure that contains some of the earliest generated neurons of the cerebral cortex and has important developmental functions to establish intra- and extracortical connections. In human and macaque some subplate cells undergo regulated cell death, but some remain as interstitial white matter cells. In mouse and rat brains a compact layer is formed, Layer 6b, and it remains underneath the cortex, adjacent to the white matter. Whether Layer 6b in rodents is homologous to primate subplate or interstitial white matter cells is still debated. Gene expression patterns, such as those of Nurr1/Nr4a2, have suggested that the rodent subplate and the persistent subplate cells in Layer 6b and the claustrum might have similar origins. Moreover, the birthdates of the claustrum and Layer 6b are similarly precocious in mice. These observations prompted our speculations on the common developmental and evolutionary origin of the claustrum and the subplate. Here we systematically compare the currently available data on cytoarchitecture, evolutionary origin, gene expression, cell types, birthdates, neurogenesis, lineage and migration, circuit connectivity, and cell death of the neurons that contribute to the claustrum and subplate.

What specific aspects of M1 function are abnormal remains uncertain, however. Moreover, few models consider the possibility that distinct cortical neuron subtypes may be affected differently. Those questions were addressed by studying the resting activity of intratelencephalic-type corticostriatal neurons (CSNs) and distant-projecting lamina 5b pyramidal-tract type neurons (PTNs) in the macaque M1 before and after the induction of parkinsonism by administration of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Contrary to previous reports, the general population of M1 neurons (i.e., PTNs, CSNs, and unidentified neurons) showed reduced baseline firing rates following MPTP, attributable largely to a marked decrease in PTN firing rates. CSN firing rates were unmodified. Although burstiness and firing patterns remained constant in M1 neurons as a whole and CSNs in particular, PTNs became more bursty post-MPTP and less likely to fire in a regular-spiking pattern. Rhythmic spiking (found in PTNs predominantly) occurred at beta frequencies (14-32 Hz) more frequently following MPTP. These results indicate that MPTP intoxication induced distinct modifications in the activity of different M1 neuronal subtypes. The particular susceptibility of PTNs suggests that PTN dysfunction may be an important contributor to the pathophysiology of parkinsonian motor signs.","basal ganglia; firing patterns; MPTP; Parkinson's disease; primary motor cortex; DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; LAYER-V NEURONS; BASAL GANGLIA; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; MOVEMENT-DISORDERS; 1-METHYL-4-PHENYL-1,2,3,6-TETRAHYDROPYRIDINE MPTP; DOPAMINE DEPLETION; THALAMIC NEURONS; FIRING PATTERNS"

Seventy-six single axons were reconstructed from serial sagittal sections with a camera lucida. The majority of labeled GPe cells displayed long, aspiny, and poorly branched dendrites that arborized mostly along the sagittal plane, whereas others showed dendrites radiating in all directions. Numerous GPe axone emitted short, intranuclear collaterals that arborized close to their parent cell body. Based on their axonal targets, four distinct types of GPe projection neurons have been identified: 1) neurons that project to the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi), the subthalamic nucleus (STN), and the substantia nigra, pars reticulata (SNr; 13.2%); 2) neurons; that target the GPi and the STN (18.4%); 3) neurons that project to the STN and the SNr (52.6%); and 4) neurons that target the striatum (15.8%). Labeled GPe axons displayed large varicosities that often were closely apposed to the somata and proximal dendrites of STN, GPi, and SNr neurons. At striatal levels, however, GPe axons displayed small axonal varicosities that did not form perineuronal nets. These results suggest that the GPe is an important integrative locus in primate basal ganglia. This nucleus harbors several subtypes of projection neurons that are endowed with a highly patterned set of collaterals.

We defined two cortical areas of activation in the operculo-insular cortex in response to a painful laser stimulation: a suprasylvian opercular area, where we recorded responses peaking 140-170 ms after a painful stimulation (N140-P170), and a deeper insular area, where responses with a similar pattern peaked 180-230 ms after the stimulus (N180-P230). The average delay of 50 ms measured between the opercular and insular responses may reflect either sequential activation of the suprasylvian cortex then of the insula via corticocortical connections, or direct activation of the insula by inputs conveyed via thalamocortical projections through distinct fibres with different conduction times. We also recorded similar insular and opercular responses in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the stimulation, peaking 15 ms later than contralateraI responses; this delay is compatible with transcallosal input transmission between these cortices. The mean stereotactic coordinates of the suprasylvian opercular N140-P170 and insular N180-P230 responses were found to be very similar to those of the maximal blood-flow responses to pain reported by previous PET and functional MRI studies in these cortical areas. We were able to distinguish the suprasylvian opercular and insular cortices in terms of response latencies evoked by a painful stimulus and in terms of stereotactic coordinates of the sources of these responses. The sequential timing of activation of the suprasylvian and insular cortices shown in this study thus complements in the time domain the spatial information provided by neuro-imaging studies of the cortical processing of pain. It strongly suggests that these cortical areas are those responding with the shortest latency to peripheral pain inputs in the human brain.",pain; insula; SII area; intracerebral recordings; evoked potentials; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; SOMATOSENSORY CORTICAL AREA; EVOKED CEREBRAL POTENTIALS; ELECTRICAL SOURCE ANALYSIS; TEMPORAL-LOBE EPILEPSY; A-DELTA FIBERS; CO2-LASER STIMULATION; LATERAL SULCUS; MACAQUE MONKEYS; HUMAN BRAIN

Six amblyopes participated in this study. Standard retinotopic mapping stimuli were used to define the boundaries of early visual cortical areas. We obtained fMRI time series from thalamic, striate and extrastriate cortical regions for the connectivity study. Thalamo-striate and striate-extrastriate networks were constructed based on known anatomical connections and the effective connectivities of these networks were assessed by means of a nonlinear system identification method. The effective connectivity of all networks studied was reduced when driven by the amblyopic eye, suggesting contrary to the current single-cell model of localized signal reduction, that a significant part of the amblyopic deficit is due to anomalous interactions between cells in disparate brain regions. The effective connectivity loss was unrelated to the fMRI loss but correlated with the degree of amblyopia (ipsilateral LGN to V1 connection), suggesting that it may be a more relevant measure. Feedforward and feedback connectivities were similarly affected. A hemispheric dependence was found for the thalamo-striate feedforward input that was not present for the feedback connection, suggesting that the reduced function of the LGN recently found in amblyopic humans may not be solely determined by the feedback influence from the cortex. Both ventral and dorsal connectivities were reduced. (C) 2010 Elsevier Inc.

In rat, dendritic symmetry of the 2 main excitatory neuronal classes, spiny stellate and star pyramid neurons (SSNs and SPNs), was quantified by an asymmetry index, the dendrite-free angle. We carefully measured shrinkage and analyzed its influence on morphological parameters. SSNs had mostly eccentric morphology, whereas SPNs were nearly radially symmetric. Most asymmetric neurons were located near the barrel border. The axonal projections, analyzed at the level of layer 4, were mostly restricted to a single barrel except for those of 3 interbarrel projection neurons. Comparing voxel representations of dendrites and axon collaterals of the same neuron revealed a close overlap of dendritic and axonal fields, more pronounced in SSNs versus SPNs and considerably stronger in spiny L4 neurons versus extragranular pyramidal cells. These observations suggest that within a barrel dendrites and axons of individual excitatory cells are organized in subcolumns that may confer receptive field properties such as directional selectivity to higher layers, whereas the interbarrel projections challenge our view of barrels as completely independent processors of thalamic input.",cortical column; dendritic symmetry; interbarrel projection; intrabarrel confinement; minicolumn; shrinkage; SURROUND RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; MONKEY STRIATE CORTEX; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; LAYER-IV BARRELS; MACAQUE MONKEY; FUNCTIONAL INDEPENDENCE; FEEDFORWARD INHIBITION; COLUMNAR ORGANIZATION; RESPONSE PROPERTIES; CORTICAL BARRELS

Importantly, however, the combination of audition and touch can guide our behavior as effectively which we studied here using psychophysics and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We tested whether task-irrelevant tactile stimuli would enhance auditory detection, and whether hemispheric asymmetries would modulate these audiotactile benefits using lateralized sounds. Spatially aligned task-irrelevant tactile stimuli could occur either synchronously or asynchronously with the sounds. Auditory detection was enhanced by non-informative synchronous and asynchronous tactile stimuli, if presented on the left side. Elevated fMRI-signals to left-sided synchronous bimodal stimulation were found in primary auditory cortex (A1). Adjacent regions (planum temporale, PT) expressed enhanced BOLD-responses for synchronous and asynchronous left-sided bimodal conditions. Additional connectivity analyses seeded in right-hemispheric A1 and PT for both bimodal conditions showed enhanced connectivity with right-hemispheric thalamic, somatosensory and multisensory areas that scaled with subjects' performance. Our results indicate that functional asymmetries interact with audiotactile interplay which can be observed for left-lateralized stimulation in the right hemisphere. There, audiotactile interplay recruits a functional network of unisensory cortices, and the strength of these functional network connections is directly related to subjects' perceptual sensitivity.

Previous studies using the 2-deoxyglucose method have shown that thalamic and hippocampal structures thought to be involved in visual recognition memory are also engaged by spatial and object working memory tasks in the nonhuman primate. Networks engaged in memory processing can be recognized by analysis of patterns of activation accompanying performance of specifically designed tasks. In the present study, we compared metabolic activation of the entorhinal and perirhinal cortex during the performance of three working memory tasks [delayed response (DR), delayed alternation (DA), and delayed object alternation (DOA)] to that induced by a standard recognition memory task [delayed match-to-sample (DMS)] and a sensorimotor control task in rhesus monkeys. A region-of-interest analysis revealed elevated local cerebral glucose utilization in the perirhinal cortex in animals performing the DA, DOA, and DMS tasks, and animals performing the DMS task were distinct in showing a strong focus of activation in the lateral perirhinal cortex. No significant differences were evident between groups performing memory and control tasks in the entorhinal cortex. These findings suggest that the perirhinal cortex may play a much broader role in memory processing than has been previously thought, encompassing explicit working memory as well as recognition memory.",nan; DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; CEREBRAL GLUCOSE-UTILIZATION; PERIRHINAL CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEYS; TEMPORAL-LOBE; ENTORHINAL CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; PARAHIPPOCAMPAL CORTICES; HIPPOCAMPAL-FORMATION; EPISODIC MEMORY

Many of the theoretical models advanced to explain function in this system, however, do not reflect the wealth of information on the connectivity of these structures, and employ greatly simplified treatments of its complex connectivity. We were interested in whether a more analytical approach, which begins with analysis of the connectivity of the system, might provide insights complementary to those derived by synthetic models. Accordingly, We collated detailed neuroanatomical information about the connectivity of the hippocampal system in the rat, and analysed the resulting data. Analyses of connectivity based on a variety of different analytical techniques have recently been used to elucidate the global organization of other systems in the macaque and cat, and have given rise to successful predictions. We applied non-metric multidimensional scaling and non-parametric cluster analysis to our summary matrix of connection data. The analyses produced organizational schemes that were consistent with known physiological properties and provided the basis for making tentative predictions of the further structures that may contain 'place' and 'head-direction' cells, which structures we identify. The consistency between the analyses of connectivity and the distribution of physiological properties across the system suggests that functional relationships are constrained by the organization of the connectivity of the system, and so that structure and function are linked at the systems level.",spatial memory; cluster analysis; place cells; head-direction cells; corticocortical connections; neuroinformatics; ANTERIOR THALAMIC NUCLEI; HEAD-DIRECTION CELLS; FREELY MOVING RATS; CORTICAL VISUAL-SYSTEM; CAT CEREBRAL-CORTEX; PLACE CELLS; ANTEROGRADE TRANSPORT; EFFERENT CONNECTIONS; BRAIN CONNECTIVITY; PREFRONTAL CORTEX

Here we identify a pathway from the first synapse in the retina to koniocellular layer K1 in marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus). Particle-mediated gene transfer of an expression plasmid for the postsynaptic density 95-green fluorescent protein (PSD95-GFP) was used to label excitatory synapses on retinal ganglion cells and combined with immunofluorescence to identify the presynaptic bipolar cells. We found that axon terminals of one type of diffuse bipolar cell (DB6) provide dominant synaptic input to the dendrites of narrow thorny ganglion cells. Retrograde tracer injections into the LGN and photofilling of retinal ganglion cells showed that narrow thorny cells were preferentially labeled when koniocellular layer K1 was targeted. Layer K1 contains cells with high sensitivity for rapid movement, and layer K1 sends projections to association visual areas as well as to primary visual cortex. We hypothesize that the DB6-narrow thorny-koniocellular pathway contributes to residual visual functions (blindsight) that survive injury to primary visual cortex in adult or early life.",bipolar cells; ganglion cells; koniocellular; parallel pathways; primate retina; RECEPTIVE-FIELD PROPERTIES; DIFFUSE BIPOLAR CELLS; MIDGET GANGLION-CELLS; NEW-WORLD MONKEY; PRIMATE RETINA; MACAQUE MONKEY; CALLITHRIX-JACCHUS; STRIATE CORTEX; AREA-MT; WIDE-FIELD

These aspects of vision that survive V1 lesions have been attributed to direct thalamic pathways to extrastriate areas, including the middle temporal area (MT). However, studies in New World monkeys and humans have questioned this interpretation, suggesting that remnants of V1 are responsible for both the activation of MT and residual vision. We studied the visual responses of neurons in area MT in New World marmoset monkeys in the weeks after lesions of V1. The extent of the scotoma in each case was estimated by mapping the receptive fields of cells located near the lesion border and by histological reconstruction. Two response types were observed among the cells located in the part of MT that corresponds, in visuotopic coordinates, to the lesioned part of V1. Many neurons (62%) had receptive fields that were displaced relative to their expected location, so that they represented the visual field immediately surrounding the scotoma. This may be a consequence of a process analogous to the reorganization of the V1 map after retinal lesions. However, another 20% of the cells had receptive fields centered inside the scotoma. Most of these neurons were strongly direction-selective, similar to normal MT cells. These results show that MT cells differ in their responses to lesioning of V1 and that only a subpopulation of MT neurons can be reasonably linked to residual vision and blindsight.",marmoset; vision; extrastriate; receptive fields; blindsight; scotoma; CALLITHRIX-JACCHUS; VISUOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; MARMOSET MONKEY; MACAQUE MONKEY; REVERSIBLE INACTIVATION; TOPOGRAPHIC PLASTICITY; RETINAL LESIONS; ADULT CAT; BLINDSIGHT; MT

On the basis of the following criteria: the size and the shape of the synaptic vesicles, the distribution and density of the vesicular population, the size and the shape of the synaptic boutons, their origin, an the characteristics of the active synaptic zones, several types of synaptic boutons in the ICc have been discriminated: LR1, LR2, SR, SSB, F1, F2, P, DCV-terminals, and d-profiles. The LR 1, LR2, SR and SSB bouton types contain clear, round or slightly oval synaptic vesicles and form asymmetrical synapses mainly with middle sized and small dendrites and dendritic spines. LR2-terminals not rarely contact also the neuronal perikarya, whilst the SR-boutons form exclusively axodendritic and axospinous synapses. The P, F1 and F2-boutons contain a pleomorphic vesicular population (P-boutons), with an increased degree of vesicle flattening (F1 and F2-boutons) and form symmetrical axosomatic, axodendritic and axospinous contacts. Especially often the F1-boutons form axosomatic synapses, whilst the F2-terminals end mainly on dendrites. The DCV-boutons contain a mixed population of clear round synaptic vesicles and large dense core vesicles. The DCV-boutons terminate mainly on spines and small distal dendrites by means of asymmetrical synaptic specializations. The d-profiles originate from dendrites, and are identical to the thalamic d-profiles but are far more rarely observed in the ICc. The d-profiles are postsynaptic mainly to the LR-types, and are presynaptic to conventional dendrites, thus participating in synaptic triads. The axonal hillocks and the initial axonal segments of the larger perikarya in the ICc are substantially inervated mainly by LR and P-boutons. Glomerulus-like formations are fairly often, especially around the LR1-terminals, contacting several small postsynaptic targets. True synaptic glomeruli are only rarely observed. Branching myelinated axons are found mainly within the fibrodendritic laminae, whilst unmyelinated collaterals, emitted by myelinated axons are especially often encountered outside the laminae.

However, until now, there has been little evidence that the caudate nucleus plays a role in smooth pursuit eye movements. In the present study, we physiologically identified the smooth pursuit subregion of the frontal eye field (FEFsem) and the saccadic subregion of the frontal eye field (FEFsac) in four Cebus monkeys. Anterogradely transported tracers (biotinylated dextran amines and wheat germ aglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase) were then used to determine the efferent connections of the FEFsem to the caudate nucleus and to compare those connections with projections arising in the FEFsac. We observed dense projections from the FEFsem to the head and body of the caudate. The FEFsem and FEFsac terminal fields were of approximately equal density and total area. The region of FEFsem-labeled axon terminals overlapped only slightly with the region of FEFsac-labeled terminals. These results suggest that the caudate nucleus may play an important role in the control of smooth pursuit eye movements via feedback loops involving the basal ganglia and thalamus. Our results further suggest that the basal ganglia circuitry concerned with controlling visual pursuit is physically segregated from that concerned with controlling saccadic eye movements.",nan; ROSTRAL SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; LOCAL DOPAMINE DEPLETION; SMOOTH-PURSUIT; BASAL GANGLIA; MOVEMENT SUBREGIONS; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; SUBCORTICAL CONNECTIONS; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; GLOBUS PALLIDUS; MACACA-MULATTA

Our studies of vertical connections reveal a remarkable specificity in the laminar arrangement of the projections from layer IV to layer III that establishes three parallel intracortical pathways. The pathways that emerge from layer IV are not simple continuations of parallel thalamocortical pathways. Layer IV and its connections with layer II/III restructure the inputs from the LGN, combining the activity from ON and OFF channels and from the left and right eye and transmit the products of this synthesis to separate strata within the overlying layers. In addition, studies of two other prominent vertical connection pathways, the projections from layer VI to layer IV and from layer II/III to layer V suggest that the parallel nature of these systems is perpetuated throughout the cortical depth. Our studies of horizontal connections have revealed a systematic relationship between a neuron's orientation preference and the distribution of its axon arbor across the cortical map of visual space. Horizontal connections in layer II/III extend for greater distances and give rise to a greater number of terminals along an axis of the visual field map that corresponds to the neuron's preferred orientation. These findings suggest that the contribution of horizontal inputs to the response properties of layer II/III neurons is likely to be greater in regions of visual space that lie along the axis of preferred orientation (endzones) than along the orthogonal axis (side zones). Topographically aligned horizontal connections may contribute to the orientation preference of layer II/III neurons and could account for the axial specificity of some receptive field surround effects. Together, these results emphasize that specificity in the spatial arrangement of local circuit axon arbors plays an important role in shaping the response properties of neurons in visual cortex.",nan; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; INTRINSIC CONNECTIONS; MACAQUE MONKEY; TUPAIA-GLIS; LAMINAR ORGANIZATION; ORIENTATION SELECTIVITY; HORIZONTAL CONNECTIONS; CROSS-CORRELATION; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; LAYER-III

These cannabinoid receptors have been well characterized in rodent and monkey retinae. Here, we investigated the expression and localization of the eCB system beyond the retina, namely the first thalamic relay, the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), of vervet monkeys using immunohistochemistry methods. Our results show that CB1R is expressed throughout the dLGN with more prominent labeling in the magnocellular layers. The same pattern is observed for the degradation enzyme, fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH). However, the synthesizing enzyme N-acyl-phosphatidylethanolamine phospholipase D (NAPE-PLD) is expressed homogenously throughout the dLGN with no preference for any of the layers. These proteins are weakly expressed in the koniocellular layers. These results suggest that the presence of the eCB system throughout the layers of the dLGN may represent a novel site of neuro-modulatory action in normal vision. The larger amount of CB1R in the dLGN magnocellular layers may explain some of the behavioral effects of cannabinoids associated with the integrity of the dorsal visual pathway that plays a role in visual-spatial localization and motion perception.

Extensive laboratory investigations were negative apart from abnormalities in some mitochondrial enzymes and immunologic parameters. Autopsies demonstrated severe leukodystrophy with myelin and axonal loss, axonal spheroids and macrophages with early and severe frontal white matter involvement. The extent and degree of changes outside the frontal lobe appeared to correlate with disease duration.

We used functional MRI to investigate the neural representation of cross-modal matching between tactile and visual shape information in eleven normal volunteers. During the scan, patterns of 2D shapes were presented both tactually and visually, simultaneously. Four different matching tasks were performed: tactile-tactile with eyes closed (TT), tactile-tactile with visual input (TTv), visual-visual with tactile input (VVt), and tactile-visual (TV). The TT task activated the contralateral primary sensorimotor area, and the postcentral gyrus, superior parietal lobules, anterior portion of the intraparietal sulcus, secondary somatosensory cortex, thalamus, dorsal premotor area, cerebellum, and supplementary motor area bilaterally, without occipital involvement. Visual matching activated the primary visual cortex and the lingual and fusiform gyri bilaterally. A cross-modal area was identified by subtracting TTv images from TV images, subtracting VVt images from TV images, and then determining common active areas. There was one discrete area that was active bilaterally; the posterior intraparietal sulcus close to the parieto-occipital sulcus. These data suggest that shape information from different sensory modalities may be integrated in the posterior intraparietal sulcus during tactile-visual matching tasks.

Part of the tectofugal pathway, the ectostriatum receives a large ascending thalamic input from the nucleus rotundus, the homolog of the mammalian pulvinar complex. We investigated the effects of bilateral lesions of the ectostriatum in pigeons on visual motion and spatial-pattern perception tasks. To test motion perception, we measured performance on a task requiring detection of coherently moving random dots embedded in dynamic noise. To test spatial-pattern perception, we measured performance on the detection of a square wave grating embedded in static noise. A double dissociation was revealed. Pigeons with lesions to the caudal ectostriatum showed a performance deficit on the motion task but not the grating task. In contrast, pigeons with lesions to the rostral ectostriatum showed a performance deficit on the grating task but not the motion task. Thus, in the avian telencephalon, there is a separation of visual motion and spatial-pattern perception as there is in the mammalian telencephalon. However, this separation of function is in the targets of the tectofugal pathway in pigeons rather than in the thalamofugal pathway as described in mammals. The implications of these findings with respect to the evolution of the visual system are discussed. Specifically, we suggest that the principle of parallel visual streams originated in the tectofugal pathway rather than the thalamofugal pathway.",ectostriatum; visual motion; pattern vision; tectofugal; extrastriate pathway; pigeon; POSTERIOR-PULVINAR COMPLEX; PIGEON COLUMBA-LIVIA; FINCH TAENIOPYGIA-GUTTATA; STRIATE-RECIPIENT ZONE; NUCLEUS ROTUNDUS; MACAQUE MONKEY; ZEBRA FINCH; DISCRIMINATION DEFICITS; ECTOSTRIATAL LESIONS; AFFERENT CONNECTIONS

Here, we provide a systematic analysis of the patterns of activity in cMRF neurons during head unrestrained gaze shifts. Two types of cMRF neurons were found: presaccadic neurons began to discharge before the onset of gaze movements, while postsaccadic neurons began to discharge after gaze shift onset and typically after the end of the gaze shift. Presaccadic neuronal responses were well correlated with gaze movements, while the discharge of postsaccadic neurons was more closely associated with head movements. The activity of presaccadic neurons was organized into gaze movement fields, while the activity of postsaccadic neurons was better organized into movement fields associated with head displacement. We found that cMRF neurons displayed both open and closed movement field responses. Neurons with closed movement fields discharged before a specific set of gaze (presaccadic) or head (postsaccadic) movement amplitudes and directions and had a clear distal boundary. Neurons with open movement fields discharged for gaze or head movements of a specific direction and also for movement amplitudes up to the limit of measurement (70 degrees). A subset of open movement field neurons displayed an increased discharge with increased gaze shift amplitudes, similar to pontine burst neurons, and were called monotonically increasing open movement field neurons. In contrast, neurons with non-monotonically open movement fields demonstrated activity for all gaze shift amplitudes, but their activity reached a plateau or declined gradually for gaze shifts beyond specific amplitudes. We suggest that presaccadic neurons with open movement fields participate in a descending pathway providing gaze signals to medium-lead burst neurons in the paramedian pontine reticular formation, while presaccadic closed movement field neurons may participate in feedback to the superior colliculus. The previously unrecognized group of postsaccadic cMRF neurons may provide signals of head position or velocity to the thalamus, cerebellum, or spinal cord.",nan; PRIMATE SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; SACCADIC EYE-MOVEMENTS; GAZE SHIFTS; ELECTRICAL-STIMULATION; BURST NEURONS; EFFERENT NEURONS; RHESUS-MONKEY; SUBCORTICAL CONTRIBUTIONS; NUCLEUS CUNEIFORMIS; VESTIBULAR NUCLEI

Lyn protein was prevalent in restricted cell populations of the olfactory bulb and the basal forebrain which included nuclei of accumbens, fundal striatum, bed stria, ventral pallidum and central amygdala as well as deep entorhinal and pyriform cortices. Tightly packed Lyn-positive cells formed discrete multiple stripes crossing perpendicular to the rostral limb of the anterior commissure, and intense masses surrounding the caudal limb. In the thalamus, the habenula, anterodorsal nucleus and medial geniculate body, together with the paraventricular hypothalamic nuclei, had prominent reactive neuronal somata and dendrites in the neuropil. The lateral septal nucleus also had intense Lyn-positive neurons with overlapping dendritic fields. In addition, scattered neurons were evenly distributed throughout the striatum. The red, interpeduncular, auditory and trigeminal tract nuclei were intensely reactive. The cerebellar molecular layer was uniformly labeled except for a few isolated fiber bundles in the lowest part of this layer. The granule cells adjacent to the Purkinje cell layer appeared in reactive patches. In the spinal cord, the posteromarginal nucleus had intense labeling. The significance of this highly localized distribution pattern of Lyn protein may be related to connections forming functional compartments serving signal transduction within specific central nervous system circuitry.",cerebellum; cellular compartmentation; limbic system; lyn-core; sensory system; src protooncogene; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; KINASE-C-DELTA; TYROSINE KINASE; NEURAL TISSUES; NEURONAL DIFFERENTIATION; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; VENTRAL STRIATUM; GENE-EXPRESSION; MACAQUE MONKEY; SRC FAMILY

To achieve this, we made three-dimensional reconstructions of 39 single neurons and thalamic afferents labeled with horseradish peroxidase during intracellular recordings in vivo. These neurons served as representatives of the different types and provided the morphometrical data about the laminar distribution of the dendritic trees and synaptic boutons and the number of synapses formed by a given type of neuron. Extensive searches of the literature provided the estimates of numbers of the different neuronal types and their distribution across the cortical layers. Applying the simplification that synapses between different cell types are made in proportion to the boutons and dendrites that those cell types contribute to the neuropil in a given layer, we were able to estimate the probable source and number of synapses made between neurons in the six layers. The predicted synaptic maps were quantitatively close to the estimates derived from the experimental electron microscopic studies for the case of the main sources of excitatory and inhibitory input to the spiny stellate cells, which form a major target of layer 4 afferents. The map of the whole cortical circuit shows that there are very few strong but many weak excitatory projections, each of which may involve only a few percentage of the total complement of excitatory synapses of a single neuron.",cell types; cell reconstruction; interlaminar connectivity; synaptic weights; connectivity rule; laminar distribution; SPINY STELLATE NEURONS; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; STRIATE CORTEX; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; SYNAPTIC CONNECTIONS; AREA 17; PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; BASKET CELLS; MACAQUE MONKEY; PARVALBUMIN IMMUNOREACTIVITY

Using multi-electrode arrays positioned in cat V1 and a broadband stimulus, we show that there is also a distinct class with positive-spiking (PS) waveforms. PS units were associated mainly with non-oriented receptive fields while RS and FS units had orientation-selective receptive fields. We suggest that PS units are recordings of axons originating from the thalamus. This conclusion was reinforced by our finding that we could record PS units after cortical silencing, but not record RS and FS units. The importance of our findings is that we were able to correlate spike shapes with receptive field characteristics with high precision using multi-electrode extracellular recording techniques. This allows considerable increases in the amount of information that can be extracted from future cortical experiments. Extracellular spike waveforms from recordings in the visual cortex have been classified into either regular-spiking (RS) or fast-spiking (FS) units. While both these types of spike waveforms are negative-dominant, we show that there are also distinct classes of spike waveforms in visual Area 17/18 (V1) of anaesthetised cats with positive-dominant waveforms, which are not regularly reported. The spatial receptive fields (RFs) of these different spike waveform types were estimated, which objectively revealed the existence of oriented and non-oriented RFs. We found that units with positive-dominant spikes, which have been associated with recordings from axons in the literature, had mostly non-oriented RFs (84%), which are similar to the centre-surround RFs observed in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). Thus, we hypothesise that these positive-dominant waveforms may be recordings from dLGN afferents. We recorded from V1 before and after the application of muscimol (a cortical silencer) and found that the positive-dominant spikes (PS) remained while the RS and FS cells did not. We also noted that the PS units had spiking characteristics normally associated with dLGN units (i.e. higher response spike rates, lower response latencies and higher proportion of burst spikes). Our findings show quantitatively that it is possible to correlate the RF properties of cortical neurons with particular spike waveforms. This has implications for how extracellular recordings should be interpreted and complex experiments can now be contemplated that would have been very challenging previously, such as assessing the feedforward connectivity between brain areas in the same location of cortical tissue.",area 17; 18; cat; electrophysiology; extracellular spike waveform; receptive field; visual cortex; MACAQUE V1; PHYSIOLOGICAL-PROPERTIES; ORIENTATION SELECTIVITY; INHIBITORY INTERNEURONS; BINOCULAR INTERACTION; POTASSIUM CHANNEL; PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; ACTION-POTENTIALS; SPATIAL STRUCTURE; THALAMIC INPUTS

Using retrograde transneuronal transfer of rabies virus combined with a conventional tracer, we identified direct and polysynaptic pathways to two PPC areas, the rostral medial intraparietal area (MIP) and the ventral part of the lateral intraparietal area (LIPv) in macaque monkeys. We found that rostral MIP and LIPv receive ascending vestibular pathways, and putative efference copy inputs disynaptically from the medullary medial reticular formation (MRF) where reticulospinal pathways to neck and arm motoneurons originate. LIPv receives minor disynaptic vestibular inputs, and substantial projections from the head movement-related rostral MRF, consistent with head gain modulation of LIPv activity and a role in planning gaze shifts. Rostral MIP is the target of prominent disynaptic pathways from reaching- and head movement-related MRF domains, and major ascending vestibular pathways trisynaptically from both labyrinths, explaining prominent vestibular responses and discrimination between active and passive movements demonstrated in rostral MIP and in the neighboring ventral intraparietal area, which are heavily interconnected. The findings that rostral MIP (belonging to the 'parietal reach region'), receives vestibular inputs as directly as classical vestibular areas, via a parallel channel, and efference copy signals pathways from MRF reticulospinal domains that belong to reach and head movement networks have important implications for the understanding of the role of the PPC in updating body representations and internal models for online guidance of movement.",monkey; scarpa; systems neuroscience; ventral intraparietal area; virus; PRIMATE SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; LATERAL INTRAPARIETAL AREA; POSTERIOR THALAMUS NEURONS; PASSIVE HEAD MOVEMENTS; DORSAL COLUMN NUCLEI; SELF-MOTION SIGNALS; BRAIN-STEM; MULTIMODAL INTEGRATION; SHOULDER MUSCLES; EYE-MOVEMENT

In grossly simplified terms and assuming random connectivity, such studies predict that input from the thalamus terminates primarily in layer 4, is relayed 'forward' to layer 3, then to layers 5 and 6 from where the modified signal may exit the cortex. Projection patterns also indicate 'back' projections from layer 5 to 3 and layer 6 to 4. More recently it has become clear that the interconnections between these layers are not random; forward projections primarily contact specific pyramidal subclasses and intracortical back projections innervate interneurones. This indicates that presynaptic axons or postsynaptic dendrites are capable of selecting their synaptic partners and that this selectivity is layer dependent. For the past decade, we and others have studied pyramidal cell targeting in circuits both within, and between laminae using paired intracellular recordings with biocytin filling and have begun to identify further levels of selectivity through the preferential targeting of electrophysiologically and/or morphologically distinct pyramidal subtypes. Presented here, therefore, is a brief overview of current thinking on the layer and subclass specific connectivity of neocortical principle excitatory cells.

In primates, most of the retinal ganglion cells that project to the LGN belong to one of two classes, P and M, whose axons terminate in the parvocellular or magnocellular subdivisions of the LGN. These cell classes give rise to two channels that have been distinguished anatomically, physiologically and behaviourally1-3,16,17. The visual cortex also can be subdivided into two pathways, one specialized for motion processing and the other for colour and form information4. Several lines of indirect evidence have suggested a close correspondence between the subcortical and cortical pathways, such that the M channel provides input to the motion pathway and the P channel drives the colour/form pathway5-7. This hypothesis was tested directly by selectively inactivating either the magnocellular or parvocellular subdivision of the LGN and recording the effects on visual responses in the cortex. We have previously reported that, in accordance with the hypothesis, responses in the motion pathway in the cortex depend primarily on magnocellular LGN8. We now report that in the colour/form pathway, visual responses depend on both P and M input.

In the LGN, PV, CR, and CB immunoreactivity was present in all laminae, slightly stronger in the magnocellular than in the parvocellular laminae for CB and CR. PV-ir puncta, representing transversally cut axons, and CR-ir fibers were revealed within the laminae and interlaminar zones, and just beyond the outer border of lamina 6 in the geniculate capsule. In the optic radiation both PV- and CR-immunoreactive neurons, puncta, and fibers were present. CB immunoreactivity was revealed in neurons of all laminae of the lateral geniculate nucleus, including S lamina and interlaminar zones. There were hardly any CB-ir puncta or fibers in the laminae, interlaminar zones, geniculate capsule, or optic radiation. In the lateral inferior pulvinar, immunoreactive neurons for the three calcium-binding proteins were present in smaller number than in the LGN, as well as PV-ir puncta and CR-ir fibers within the nucleus and in the pulvinar capsule. In the white matter underlying area 17, fibers intermingled with a few scattered neurons were stained for both PV and CR, but very rarely for CB. These fibers stopped at the limit between areas 17 and 18. Area 17 showed a dense plexus of PV-ir puncta and neurons in the thalamo-receptive layer IV and CR-ir puncta and neurons both in the superficial layers I-II, IIIC, and in layer VA. Cajal-Retzius CR-ir neurons were present in layer I. CB-ir puncta were almost confined to layer I-III and CB-ir neurons to layer II. Finally the superior colliculus exhibited mostly populations of PV and CR pyramidal-like immunoreactive neurons, mainly in the intermediate tier. These data suggest that in the visual thalamus most calcium-binding protein immunoreactive neurons project to the visual cortex, while in the superior colliculus a smaller immunoreactive population represent projection neurons.",calcium-binding proteins; lateral geniculate nucleus; visual cortex; superior colliculus; human; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; CAT SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; PARVALBUMIN-IMMUNOREACTIVITY; MONOCULAR ENUCLEATION; RHESUS-MONKEY; IMMUNOCYTOCHEMICAL LOCALIZATION; ALZHEIMERS-DISEASE; STRIATE CORTEX; CALBINDIN; NEURONS

The PET images were registered with magnetic resonance images from each subject so that increases in rCBF could be localized with anatomical precision in individual subjects. Increased neural activity was examined in relation to the hand used to reach, irrespective of field of reach (hand effect), and the effects of target field of reach, irrespective of hand used (field effect). A separate analysis on intersubject, averaged PET data was also performed. A comparison of the results of tile two analyses showed close correspondence in the areas of activation that were identified. We did not find a strict segregation of regions associated exclusively with either hand or field. Overall, significant rCBF increases in the hand sind field conditions occurred bilaterally in the supplementary motor area, premotor cortex, cuneus, lingual gyrus, superior temporal cortex, insular cortex, thalamus, and putamen. Primary motor cortex, postcentral gyrus, and the superior parietal lobule (intraparietal sulcus) showed predominantly a contralateral hand effect, whereas the inferior parietal lobule showed this effect for the left hand only. Greater contralateral responses for the right hand were observed in the secondary motor areas. Only the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices exhibited strong ipsilateral hand effects, Field of reach was more com monly associated with bilateral patterns of activation in the areas with contralateral or ipsilateral hand effects, These results suggest that the Visual and motor components of reaching may have a different functional organization and that many brain regions represent both limb of reach and field of reach. However, since posterior parietal cortex is connected with all of these regions, we suggest that it plays a crucial role in the integration of limb and field coordinates.",visually guided reaching; PET; MRI; posterior parietal cortex; human; POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; BEHAVING RHESUS-MONKEY; CORTICAL MOTOR AREAS; CEREBRAL BLOOD-FLOW; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; ARM MOVEMENTS; VOLUNTARY MOVEMENTS; CINGULATE CORTEX; NEURAL REPRESENTATIONS; EXTRAPERSONAL SPACE

Each pathway possesses a functionally distinct role for action selection. The current study quantified and compared the structural connectivity between 17 distinct cortical areas with the STN and STR using 7 Tesla diffusion weighted magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) and resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) in healthy young subjects. The selection of these cortical areas was based on a literature search focusing on animal tracer studies. The results indicate that, relative to other cortical areas, both the STN and STR showed markedly weaker structural connections to areas assumed to be essential for action inhibition such as the inferior frontal cortex pars opercularis. Additionally, the cortical connectivity fingerprint of the STN and STR indicated relatively strong connections to areas related to voluntary motor initiation such as the cingulate motor area and supplementary motor area. Overall the results indicated that the cortical-STN connections were sparser compared to the STR. There were two notable exceptions, namely for the orbitofrontal cortex and ventral medial prefrontal cortex, where a higher tract strength was found for the STN.

This interplay may be critical for likelihood of developing depressive episodes, at least in a subgroup of sensitive individuals. The serotonin 4 receptor (5-HT4R) indexes central serotonergic tonus, which may be related to endogenous sex-steroid levels in the mentally healthy state even though this remains elusive. Here we evaluate if peripheral levels of estradiol and testosterone are associated with 5-HT4R binding as imaged by [C-11]SB207145 positron emission tomography in a group of 41 healthy men. We estimated global 5-HT4R binding using a latent variable model framework, which models shared correlation between 5-HT4R across multiple brain regions (hippocampus, amygdala, posterior and anterior cingulate, thalamus, pallidostriatum and neocortex). We tested whether testosterone and estradiol predict global 5-HT4R, adjusting for age. We found that testosterone, but not estradiol, correlated negatively with global 5-HT4R levels (p = 0.02) suggesting that men with high levels of testosterone have higher cerebral serotonergic tonus. Our findings corroborate the link between sex hormone levels and serotonin signalling. Future longitudinal studies in clinical relevant populations are needed to elucidate the potential importance of testosterone in the pathophysiology of e.g. major depression and its treatment.

In this study, we used two rs-fMRI measures to investigate the changes in brain function activity in DYS and their correlations with dysphagia severity. MethodIn this study, a total of 22 patients with DYS were compared with 30 patients without dysphagia (non-DYS) and matched for baseline characteristics. Then, rs-fMRI scans were performed in both groups, and regional homogeneity (ReHo) and fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (fALFF) values were calculated in both groups. The two-sample t-test was used to compare ReHo and fALFF between the groups. Pearson's correlation analysis was used to determine the correlations between the ReHo and fALFF of the abnormal brain regions and the scores of the Functional Oral Intake Scale (FOIS), the Standardized Bedside Swallowing Assessment (SSA), the Videofluoroscopic Swallowing Study (VFSS), and the Penetration-Aspiration Scale (PAS). ResultsCompared with the non-DYS group, the DYS group showed decreased ReHo values in the left thalamus, the left parietal lobe, and the right temporal lobe and significantly decreased fALFF values in the right middle temporal gyrus and the inferior parietal lobule. In the DYS group, the ReHo of the right temporal lobe was positively correlated with the SSA score and the PAS score (r = 0.704, p < 0.001 and r = 0.707, p < 0.001, respectively) but negatively correlated with the VFSS score (r = -0.741, p < 0.001). The ReHo of the left parietal lobe was positively correlated with SSA and PAS (r = 0.621, p = 0.002 and r = 0.682, p < 0.001, respectively) but negatively correlated with VFSS (r = -0.679, p = 0.001).

Contextual factors, such as longer time fasting, subjective hunger, and body mass index (BMI), may increase the likelihood of overeating. Nevertheless, the neural mechanisms underlying these moderating influences on energy intake are poorly understood. Methods We conducted both categorical meta-analysis and meta-regression of factors modulating neural responses to sweet stimuli, using data from 30 functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) articles incorporating 39 experiments (N = 995) carried out between 2006 and 2019. Results Responses to sweet stimuli were associated with increased activity in regions associated with taste, sensory integration, and reward processing. These taste-evoked responses were modulated by context. Longer fasts were associated with higher posterior cerebellar, thalamic, and striatal activity. Greater self-reported hunger was associated with higher medial orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), dorsal striatum, and amygdala activity and lower posterior cerebellar activity. Higher BMI was associated with higher posterior cerebellar and insular activity. Conclusions Variations in fasting time, self-reported hunger, and BMI are contexts associated with differential sweet stimulus responses in regions associated with reward processing and homeostatic regulation. These results are broadly consistent with a hierarchical model of taste processing. Hunger, but not fasting or BMI, was associated with sweet stimulus-related OFC activity. Our findings extend existing models of taste processing to include posterior cerebellar regions that are associated with moderating effects of both state (fast length and self-reported hunger) and trait (BMI) variables.",nan; NUCLEUS-ACCUMBENS SHELL; MEN WOMEN BOYS; BRAIN RESPONSE; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; SATIETY SENSATIONS; GUSTATORY CORTEX; TASTE INTENSITY; MACAQUE MONKEY; INSULAR CORTEX; REWARD VALUE

Eight human subjects performed visually guided hand movements, either continuously tracking a horizontally moving target or performing ballistic tracking movements of a cursor to an eccentric stationary target while fixating a central fixation cross. The tracking movements were back-projected onto the screen using a cursor which was moved by an MRI-compatible joystick. Both conditions activated area V5 (hMT+), right more than left, particularly during continuous tracking. In addition, a large-scale sensorimotor circuit which included sensorimotor cortex, premotor cortex, striatum, thalamus and cerebellum as well as a number of cortical areas along the intraparietal sulcus in both hemispheres were activated. Because activity was increased in V5 (hMT+) during continuous tracking but not during ballistic tracking as compared to motion perception, it has a pivotal role during the visual control of forelimb movements as well.",area MT; extrastriate cortex; functional neuroimaging; human; visual motion; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; CORTICAL AREAS MT; ATTENTIONAL MODULATION; FUNCTIONAL-PROPERTIES; REACHING MOVEMENTS; MOTION; PERCEPTION; ACTIVATION; MACAQUE; BRAIN

Typically, the volume of water drunk in response to thirst matches the deficit. Exactly how this accurate metering is achieved is unknown; recent evidence implicates swallowing inhibition as a potential factor. Using fMRI, this study investigated whether swallowing inhibition is present after more water has been drunk than is necessary to restore fluid balance within the body. This proposal was tested using ratings of swallowing effort and measuring regional brain responses as participants prepared to swallow small volumes of liquid while they were thirsty and after they had overdrunk. Effort ratings provided unequivocal support for swallowing inhibition, with a threefold increase in effort after overdrinking, whereas addition of 8% (wt/vol) sucrose to water had minimal effect on effort before or after overdrinking. Regional brain responses when participants prepared to swallow showed increases in the motor cortex, prefrontal cortices, posterior parietal cortex, striatum, and thalamus after overdrinking, relative to thirst. Ratings of swallowing effort were correlated with activity in the right prefrontal cortex and pontine regions in the brainstem; no brain regions showed correlated activity with pleasantness ratings. These findings are all consistent with the presence of swallowing inhibition after excess water has been drunk. We conclude that swallowing inhibition is an important mechanism in the overall regulation of fluid intake in humans.",thirst; drinking; swallowing; inhibition; fMRI; TRIGEMINAL MOTOR NUCLEUS; MONKEY MACACA-FASCICULARIS; RHYTHMICAL JAW MOVEMENTS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; BASAL GANGLIA; VASOPRESSIN SECRETION; CORTICAL PROJECTIONS; SWEET PREFERENCES; PRECENTRAL CORTEX; WATER DRINKING

In the retina, GABA immunoreactivity (both somata and fibers) was observed in all layers except the outer nuclear layer (ONL). Contrary to earlier reports, about 30% of total neurons within ganglion cell layer (GCL) expressed GABA immunoreactivity. Double-labeling studies indicated that about half of the GABA-containing perikarya in the GCL were retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). In the diencephalon, intensely labeled GABA-immunoreactive neurons and nerve fibers were observed within the neuropil of Bellonci (nB) and corpus geniculatum (CG), while only immunoreactive puncta were found in the rostral visual nucleus (RVN). In the pretectal region, the posterior thalamic nucleus (nPT) contained the most intensely labeled GABA immunoreactive perikarya and nerve fibers in the entire brain. Lightly immunoreactive perikarya were also found in the large-celled nucleus lentiformis mesencephali (nLM), as well as in the pretectal gray, which contains neurons postsynaptic to the retinal terminal zones within nLM. In the optic tectum (OT), both immunoreactive perikarya and fibers were found within superficial layers 8 and 9, whereas only densely packed immunoreactive perikarya were evident in the deep tectal layers (i.e. 2, 4, 6). The nucleus of the basal optic root (nBOR) contained a small number of lightly labeled GABA-immunoreactive perikarya, mostly located in the dorsal half of the nucleus.

Early recordings suggested that the PBN transmitted a faithful representation of taste activity from the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS). However, its role assumed greater significance as its subnuclei were shown to deal with different aspects of taste, visceral sensations, hedonics, and conditioned aversions. The discovery of parallel projections from PBN to the thalamus and to ventral forebrain, and evidence that the former carried sensory information while the latter signaled hedonics, conferred on PBN a central role in guiding feeding. Thus, it was surprising to discover that the PBN is not a taste relay in primates. So arose a distinction between rodents, in which parallel processing of taste and hedonic information is the rule, and primates, where serial processing through the cortex precedes a hedonic assessment. Where does the integration of taste and hedonics occur, and how does this affect feeding? Neurons in both NTS and PBN of rodents are modified by changing physiological conditions. That altered activity parallels and perhaps directs the rodent's feeding behavior. Information from primate NTS implies no such modification. These interactions are reserved for orbitofrontal cortex and ventral forebrain. The implication is that in rodents, hindbrain alterations not only control the reflexes associated with taste, but also direct food selection through the PBN-ventral forebrain projections. In primates, the apparatus is in place for an independent cognitive analysis unaltered by physiological state, upon which a hedonic assessment is subsequently overlaid.",taste; feeding; parabrachial nucleus; rodent; primate; hedonics; TRACTUS-SOLITARIUS; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; BRAIN-STEM; RESPONSES; RATS; NEURONS; SATIETY; HUNGER; INTENSITY

Computerized perimetry indicated a left visual field defect only although MRI and (18)FDG-PET scans showed abnormalities in both occipital lobes. The visual stimuli were semicircular gratings moving in opposite directions on a dynamic random-dot background. They were specifically constructed to eliminate intra- and extraocular light scatter and to optimize the activation of extra-striate cortical areas and their projecting subcortical relays. For anatomical localization PET images were coregistered to the subject's MRI in Talairach coordinates. After subtraction of the baseline conditions from the stimulation conditions, a t-statistic map was created on a voxel-by-voxel basis. Stimulation of the scotomatous hemifield yielded significant activations of Brodmann cortical areas 18-19 and 47 as well as the pulvinar thalami of the left hemisphere, in addition to a less prominent activation in the right hemisphere. Stimulation of the intact hemifield produced significant activation of Brodmann cortical areas 30 and 47 of the left hemisphere. These results suggest that in the absence of area V1, residual vision observed in the blind hemifield could be mediated by a retinofugal pathway to extrastriate cortex via the pulvinar.

We previously investigated the cortical area projecting to the gray matter of the fourth lumbar cord segment (L4) (L4 Cx) in mice. In the present study, we injected an anterograde tracer into multiple sites to cover the entire L4 Cx. We found that (1) the rostromedial part of the L4 Cx projects to the intermediate and ventral zones of the lumbar cord gray matter, (2) the lateral part projects to the medial dorsal horn, and (3) the caudal part projects to the lateral dorsal horn. We also found that the border between the rostromedial and caudolateral parts corresponds to the border between the agranular and granular cortex. Analysis of the somatotopic patterns formed by the cortical projection cells and the primary sensory neurons innervating the skin of the hindlimb and its related area suggests that the lateral part corresponds to the S1 hindlimb area and the caudal part to the S1 trunk area. Examination of thalamic innervation by the L4 Cx revealed that the caudolateral L4 Cx focally projects to the ventrobasal complex (VB) and the posterior complex (PO), while the medial L4 Cx widely projects to the PO but little to the VB.

While a number of research groups have investigated NPSLE, there remains a lack of consistent application of this diagnostic criteria within neuroimaging studies. Previous neuroimaging research suggests that SLE patients have reduced subcortical and regional gray matter volumes when compared to controls, and that these group differences may be driven by SLE patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms. The current study sought to compare measures of cortical thickness and subcortical structure volume between NPSLE, SLE, and healthy controls. We hypothesized that patients with NPSLE (N = 21) would have thinner cortex and reduced subcortical gray matter volumes when compared to SLE (N = 16) and control subjects (N = 21). All subjects underwent MRI examinations on a 1.5 Tesla Siemens Sonata scanner. Anatomical reconstruction and segmentation were performed using the FreeSurfer image analysis suite. Cortical and subcortical volumes were extracted from FreeSurfer and analyzed for group differences, controlling for age. The NPSLE group exhibited decreased cortical thickness in clusters of the left frontal and parietal lobes as well as in the right parietal and occipital lobes compared to control subjects. Compared to the SLE group, the NPSLE group exhibited comparable thinning in clusters of the frontal and temporal lobes. Controlling for age, we found that between group effects for subcortical gray matter structures were significant for the thalamus (F = 3.06, p = .04), caudate nucleus (F = 3.19, p = .03), and putamen (F = 4.82, p = .005). These results clarify previous imaging work identifying cortical atrophy in a mixed SLE and NPSLE group, and suggest that neuroanatomical abnormalities are specific to SLE patients diagnosed with neuropsychiatric symptoms. Future work should help elucidate the underlying mechanisms underlying the emerging neurobiological profile seen in NPSLE, as well as clarify the apparent lack of overlap between cortical thinning and functional activation results and other findings pointing to increased functional activation during cognitive tasks.",nan; CENTRAL-NERVOUS-SYSTEM; HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE IMAGES; PROTON MR SPECTROSCOPY; SURFACE-BASED ANALYSIS; ANTIPHOSPHOLIPID ANTIBODIES; GEOMETRICALLY ACCURATE; COORDINATE SYSTEM; RHESUS-MONKEY; BRAIN-LESIONS

The perception of self-motion during constant velocity movement is completely dependent on visually induced vection, This can be linear vection or circular vection (CV), CV is induced by large-field visual motion stimulation during which the stationary subject perceives the moving surroundings as being stable and himself as being moved. To determine the unknown cortical visual-vestibular interaction during CV, we conducted a PET activation study on CV in 10 human volunteers. The PET images of cortical areas activated during visual motion stimulation without CV were compared with those with CV, Hitherto, CV was explained neurophysiologically by visual-vestibular convergence with activation of the vestibular nuclei, thalamic subnuclei and vestibular cortex. If CV were mediated by the vestibular cortex, one would expect that an adequate visual motion stimulus would activate both the visual and vestibular cortex. Contrary to this expectation, it was shown for the first time that visual motion stimulation with CV not only activates a medial parieto-occipital visual area bilaterally, separate from middle temporal/medial superior temporal areas, it also simultaneously deactivates the parieto-insular vestibular cortex. There was a positive correlation between the perceived intensity of CV and relative changes in regional CBF in parietal and occipital areas. These findings support a new functional interpretation: reciprocal inhibitory visual-vestibular interaction as a multisensory mechanism for self-motion perception. Inhibitory visual-vestibular interaction might protect visual perception of self-motion from potential vestibular mismatches caused by involuntary head accelerations during locomotion, and this would allow the dominant sensorial weight during self-motion perception to shift from one sensory modality to the other.",PET activation study; self-motion perception; vestibular cortex; visual cortex; circular vection; POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; MONKEYS MACACA-FASCICULARIS; FUNCTIONAL BRAIN IMAGES; SELF-MOTION; PERCEPTION; PET; ACTIVATION; NEURONS; LOCALIZATION; RESPONSES

Amblyopia or lazy eye is the most common cause of uniocular blindness in adults and is caused by a disruption to normal visual development as a consequence of unmatched inputs from the two eyes in early life, arising from a turned eye (strabismus), unequal refractive error (anisometropia), or form deprivation (e.g., cataract). Using high-field functional magnetic resonance imaging in a group of human adults with amblyopia, we previously demonstrated that reduced responses are observable at a thalamic level, that of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Here we investigate the selectivity of this deficit by using chromatic and achromatic stimuli that are designed to bias stimulation to one or other of the three ascending pathways (the parvocellular, magnocellular, and koniocellular). We find the greatest LGN deficit is for stimuli modulated along the chromatic, L/M cone opponent axis of color space, suggesting a selective loss of parvocellular function in the LGN. We also demonstrate a cortical deficit that involves all the visual areas studied (V1, V2, V3, VP, V3A, V4), and we find this is greatest for the two chromatic responses (S cone opponent and L/M cone opponent) versus the achromatic response, as might be expected from a loss of segregation of chromatic pathways in the cortex.",nan; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; DISCORDANT BINOCULAR VISION; ONSET STRABISMIC AMBLYOPIA; VENTRAL OCCIPITAL CORTEX; RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; CONTRAST SENSITIVITY; STRIATE CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEYS; ANISOMETROPIC AMBLYOPIA

Here, we review recent studies of the human LGN that have investigated the retinotopic organization, physiologic response properties, and modulation of neural activity by selective attention and by visual awareness in a binocular rivalry paradigm. In the retinotopy studies, we found that the contralateral visual field was represented with the lower field in the medial-superior portion and the upper field in the lateral-inferior portion of each LGN. The fovea was represented in posterior and superior portions, with increasing eccentricities represented more anteriorly. Functional MRI responses increased monotonically with stimulus contrast in the LGN and in visual cortical areas. In the LGN, the dynamic response range of the contrast function was larger and contrast gain was lower than in the cortex. In our attention studies, we found that directed attention to a spatial location modulated neural activity in the LGN in several ways: it enhanced neural responses to attended stimuli, attenuated responses to ignored stimuli, and increased baseline activity in the absence of visual stimulation. Furthermore, we showed in a binocular rivalry paradigm that neural activity in the LGN correlated strongly with the subjects' reported percepts. The overall view that emerges from these studies is that the human LGN plays a role in perception and cognition far beyond that of a relay nucleus and, rather, needs to be considered as an early gatekeeper in the control of visual attention and awareness.",fMRI; retinotopy; magno- and parvocellular LGN; contrast response; flicker response; selective attention; binocular rivalry; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; VISUAL CORTICAL AREAS; RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; MACAQUE MONKEY; BINOCULAR-RIVALRY; STRIATE CORTEX; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; RETINOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; ATTENTIONAL MODULATION; CONTRAST SENSITIVITY

The lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus is the source of visual signals to the primary visual cortex (V1). Most large-scale cortical network models approximate the spike trains of LGN neurons as simple Poisson point processes. However, many studies have shown that neurons in the early visual pathway are capable of spiking with high temporal precision and their discharges are not Poisson-like. To gain an understanding of how response variability in the LGN influences the behavior of V1, we study response properties of model V1 neurons that receive purely feedforward inputs from LGN cells modeled either as noisy leaky integrate-and-fire (NLIF) neurons or as inhomogeneous Poisson processes. We first demonstrate that the NLIF model is capable of reproducing many experimentally observed statistical properties of LGN neurons. Then we show that a V1 model in which the LGN input to a V1 neuron is modeled as a group of NLIF neurons produces higher orientation selectivity than the one with Poisson LGN input. The second result implies that statistical characteristics of LGN spike trains are important for V1's function. We conclude that physiologically motivated models of V1 need to include more realistic LGN spike trains that are less noisy than inhomogeneous Poisson processes.",Integrate-and-fire; Lateral geniculate nucleus; Neural noise; Orientation selectivity; Poisson processes; Primary visual cortex; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; NEURONAL NETWORK MODEL; CORTICAL-NEURONS; SIMPLE CELLS; RESPONSE VARIABILITY; SPATIAL-FREQUENCY; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; MACAQUE MONKEYS; STRIATE CORTEX

The basis of its dominance is less clear. We have tested 16 left hemisphere (LH) patients, 17 right hemisphere (RH) patients and 12 neurologically normal controls on a battery of five tasks. The tasks were based on animal lesion and recording studies, and human imaging and magnetic stimulation studies that identified two distributed systems that are important for the selection of motor responses and object-oriented responses. The LH patients were impaired on three response selection tasks: learning to select between joystick movement responses instructed by visual cues; learning to select between analogous object-oriented responses instructed by visual cues; learning to select movements in a sequence. Although we replicated the finding that LH damage impairs sequencing, some of the impaired tasks had no sequencing element. We therefore argue that the LH deficits are best explained as an impairment of response selection. This was confirmed by showing that LH subjects were unimpaired on a more demanding task-object discrimination learning-which imposed a greater memory load but had no response selection element. Moreover, the LH deficits could not be attributed to disorganization of movement kinematics. The lesions of the impaired LH group were widespread but always included the distributed systems known to be important for response selection-the dorsolateral frontal and parietal cortices, striatum, thalamus and white matter fascicles.

Grip and lift forces on a similar object and the activity of selected;muscles in the hand, arm and shoulder were also recorded in separate lifting trials.

On the ipsilateral side. activation of the M1, caudal SMA and inferior parietal cortex (BA 40) was also found. In the subcortical areas, the bilateral hemispheres and right vermis of the cerebellum, left basal ganglia and thalamus were activated. Behavioral adaptation to a heavier object weight was revealed in a nearly proportional increase of both grip and lift forces, prolonged force application period and a higher level of hand and arm muscle activities.

Previous neural models propose how maps of orientation (OR), ocular dominance (OR), and related properties develop in V1. These models show how spontaneous activity, before eye opening, combined with correlation learning and competition, can generate maps similar to those found in vivo. These models have not discussed laminar architecture or how cells develop and coordinate their connections across cortical layers. This is an important problem since anatomical evidence shows that clusters of horizontal connections form, between iso-oriented regions, in layer 2/3 before being innervated by layer 4 afferents. How are orientations in different layers aligned before these connections form? Anatomical evidence demonstrates that thalamic afferents wait in the subplate for weeks before innervating layer 4. Other evidence shows that ablation of the cortical subplate interferes with the development of OR and OD columns. The model proposes how the subplate develops OR and OD maps, which then entrain and coordinate the development of maps in other lamina. The model demonstrates how these maps may develop in layer 4 by using a known transient subplate-to-layer 4 circuit as a teacher. The model subplate also guides the early clustering of horizontal connections in layer 2/3, and the formation of the interlaminar circuitry that forms cortical columns. It is shown how layer 6 develops and helps to stabilize the network when the subplate atrophies. Finally the model clarifies how brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) manipulations may influence cortical development.",nan; OCULAR DOMINANCE COLUMNS; MONKEY STRIATE CORTEX; BASIC NETWORK PRINCIPLES; CLUSTERED HORIZONTAL CONNECTIONS; CORRELATED NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; ORIENTATION SELECTIVITY; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; SELF-ORGANIZATION

The rostrotemporal auditory cortical area (RT) remains the least well characterized of the three proposed core areas, and its functional organization has only recently come under scrutiny. Here we used injections of anterograde and retrograde tracers in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) to examine the connectivity of RT and its adjacent areas. As expected from the current model, RT exhibited dense core-like reciprocal connectivity with the ventral division of the medial geniculate body, the rostral core area and the auditory belt, but had weaker connections with the parabelt. However, RT also projected to the ipsilateral rostromedial prefrontal cortex (area 10), the dorsal temporal pole and the ventral caudate nucleus, as well as bilaterally to the lateral nucleus of the amygdala. Thus, RT has connectivity with limbic structures previously believed to connect only with higher-order auditory association cortices, and is probably functionally distinct from the other core areas. While this view is consistent with a proposed role of RT in temporal integration, our results also indicate that RT could provide an anatomical 'shortcut' for processing affective content in auditory information.",auditory cortex; hierarchical processing; limbic; primate; medial prefrontal; AMYGDALO-CORTICAL PROJECTIONS; MEDIODORSAL THALAMIC NUCLEUS; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL NETWORKS; MONKEY CALLITHRIX-JACCHUS; RHESUS-MONKEY; MACAQUE MONKEYS; MACACA-FASCICULARIS; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; BELT REGIONS; HUMAN BRAIN

One prevalent hypothesis to account for this discrepancy is that posterior cingulate hypometabolism results from disconnection from the hippocampus through disruption of the cingulum bundle. However, only partial and indirect evidence currently supports this hypothesis. Thus, using structural magnetic resonance imaging and 2-[(18)F] fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose positron emission tomography in 18 patients with early AD, we assessed the relationships between hippocampal atrophy, white matter integrity, and gray matter metabolism by means of a whole-brain voxel-based correlative approach. We found that hippocampal atrophy is specifically related to cingulum bundle disruption, which is in turn highly correlated to hypometabolism of the posterior cingulate cortex but also of the middle cingulate gyrus, thalamus, mammillary bodies, parahippocampal gyrus, and hippocampus (all part of Papez's circuit), as well as the right temporoparietal associative cortex. These results provide the first direct evidence supporting the disconnection hypothesis as a major factor contributing to the early posterior hypometabolism in AD. Disruption of the cingulum bundle also appears to relate to hypometabolism in a large connected network over and above the posterior cingulate cortex, encompassing the whole memory circuit of Papez (consistent with the key location of this white matter tract within this loop) and also, but indirectly, the right posterior association cortex.",Alzheimer's disease; hippocampus; white matter; deafferentation; morphometry; PET; positron emission tomography; MILD COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT; VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY; MONKEY RETROSPLENIAL CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; FDG-PET; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; BRAIN METABOLISM; RAPID CONVERSION; TRACT INTEGRITY; EPISODIC MEMORY

In contrast, almost nothing is known about the circuitry or laminar features of multisensory processing in higher order, multisensory cortex. Therefore, using the ferret higher order multisensory rostral posterior parietal (PPr) cortex, the present investigation employed a combination of multichannel recording and neuroanatomical techniques to elucidate the laminar basis of multisensory cortical processing. The proportion of multisensory neurons, the share of neurons showing multisensory integration, and the magnitude of multisensory integration were all found to differ by layer in a way that matched the functional or connectional characteristics of the PPr. Specifically, the supragranular layers (L2/3) demonstrated among the highest proportions of multisensory neurons and the highest incidence of multisensory response enhancement, while also receiving the highest levels of extrinsic inputs, exhibiting the highest dendritic spine densities, and providing a major source of local connectivity. In contrast, layer 6 showed the highest proportion of unisensory neurons while receiving the fewest external and local projections and exhibiting the lowest dendritic spine densities. Coupled with a lack of input from principal thalamic nuclei and a minimal layer 4, these observations indicate that this higher level multisensory cortex shows functional and organizational modifications from the well-known patterns identified for primary sensory cortical regions.

Previous physiological studies indicate that SGS3/SO neurons have large receptive fields and respond to small moving stimuli. We sought to better characterize the dendritic morphology of SGS3/SO neurons with intracellular filling in slice preparations of the ground squirrel superior colliculus. We found that dendrites of widefield vertical cells end in monostratified arrays of spiny terminal specializations called bottlebrush dendritic endings. Two major subtypes of neurons are described. Type I neurons have somata restricted to the SGS3 and bottlebrush endings in the most superficial sublayer of the SGS. Type II neurons are found at the base of the SGS and in the upper SO, and have bottlebrush endings arrayed within the middle sublayers of the SGS. Bottlebrush endings may sample and integrate laminated afferents to the superior colliculus, and cellular subtypes may underlie multiple information streams within the tectopulvinar pathway. A similar dendritic morphology and projection pattern can be found in cells of the avian optic tectum that project upon the nucleus rotundus, a thalamic nucleus homologous to the mammalian caudal/inferior pulvinar. Because motion processing is a dominant feature of the avian tectorotundal pathway, the current results suggest that both dendritic morphology and motion processing are conserved features of widefield vertical cells in the tectopulvinar pathway of vertebrates.

The present study investigated this hypothesis by examining the incidence of LT bursts in 146 cells recorded from the LGN of three macaque monkeys. Bursts were defined as clusters of two or more action potentials separated by not more than 4 ms and preceded by a >= 100-ms quiescent interval. The incidence of bursts was examined in several intensive-training Go-NoGo and target selection tasks as well as in training-free tasks where natural scenes with both familiar and novel contents were shown. Our chief findings were as follows. 1) Bursts occur in the majority of cells under every condition tested, 2) burst incidence is very low (< 1 burst every 10 s), 3) bursts occur in association with a receptive field stimulus on average only once every 23 times in 65% of cells tested, 4) cells responding with bursts to the stimulus also tended to exhibit higher levels of spontaneous bursting, 5) the presence of bursts did not depend on the novelty of the stimulus or its behavioral relevance. When the monkeys explored static natural scenes, 6) bursts were not correlated with short-term changes in the image sampled by the cell's receptive field during saccades. Burst incidence 7) did not increase when images were novel or when they evoked an emotional reaction, and 8) bursts did not decrease when images were familiar. 9) Bursts were not correlated with saccades in the dark, but 10) more spikes participated in bursts in the dark. Although these results confirm the occurrence of LT bursts in LGN cells of awake monkeys, they do not support the hypothesis that these bursts are a privileged means of transferring sensory information, that they signal unexpected or significant visual events, or that they are involved uniquely in the coding of natural scenes.",nan; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; SACCADIC EYE-MOVEMENTS; SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY; THALAMIC NEURONS; RESPONSE-MODES; RHESUS-MONKEYS; RELAY NEURONS; SLEEP; CAT; STATES

Structural magnetic resonance studies indicate that brain abnormalities are present at onset, but longitudinal studies to assess neuroprogression have been limited by small samples and short or infrequent follow-up intervals. Methods: The Iowa Longitudinal Study is a prospective study of 542 first-episode patients who have been followed up to 18 years. In this report, we focus on those patients (n = 202) and control subjects (n = 125) for whom we have adequate structural magnetic resonance data (n = 952 scans) to provide a relatively definitive determination of whether progressive brain change occurs over a time interval of up to 15 years after intake. Results: A repeated-measures analysis showed significant age-by-group interaction main effects that represent a significant decrease in multiple gray matter regions (total cerebral, frontal, thalamus), multiple white matter regions (total cerebral, frontal, temporal, parietal), and a corresponding increase in cerebrospinal fluid (lateral ventricles and frontal, temporal, and parietal sulci). These changes were most severe during the early years after onset. They occur at severe levels only in a subset of patients. They are correlated with cognitive impairment but only weakly with other clinical measures. Conclusions: Progressive brain change occurs in schizophrenia, affects both gray matter and white matter, is most severe during the early stages of the illness, and occurs only in a subset of patients. Measuring severity of progressive brain change offers a promising new avenue for phenotype definition in genetic studies of schizophrenia.",First episode; longitudinal studies; neurodevelopment; neuroprogression; schizophrenia; structural magnetic resonance imaging; GRAY-MATTER VOLUME; FIRST-EPISODE SCHIZOPHRENIA; MACAQUE MONKEYS; HIPPOCAMPAL-FORMATION; ONSET SCHIZOPHRENIA; CHRONIC EXPOSURE; ABNORMALITIES; MORPHOLOGY; CORTEX; MRI

By calculating the contrast for vestibular activation minus cutaneous activation for the group, we found activations in the anterior parts of the insula, the paramedian and dorsolateral thalamus, the putamen, the inferior parietal lobule [Brodmann area (BA) 40], the precentral gyrus (frontal eye field, BA 6), the middle frontal gyrus (prefrontal cortex, BA 46/9), the middle temporal gyrus (BA 37), the superior temporal gyrus (BA 22), and the anterior cingulate gyrus (BA 32) as well as in both cerebellar hemispheres. These activations can be attributed to multisensory vestibular and ocular motor functions. Single-subject analysis in addition showed distinctly nonoverlapping activations in the posterior insula, which corresponds to the parieto-insular vestibular cortex in the monkey. During vestibular stimulation, there was also a significant signal decrease in the visual cortex (BA 18, 19), which spared BA 17. A different deactivation was found during cutaneous stimulation; it included upper parieto-occipital areas in the middle temporal and occipital gyri (BA 19/39/18). Under both stimulation conditions, there were signal decreases in the somatosensory cortex (BA 2/3/4).

However, whether different aspects of sequential information like interval and ordinal properties are supported by different anatomical regions, and whether the representation of sequential information within the PMC is necessarily related to motor requirements, remain open questions. Brain activations were investigated during a sequence encoding paradigm in 12 healthy subjects using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Subjects had to attend either to the interval or to the ordinal information of a sequence of visually presented stimuli and had to encode the relevant information either before motor reproduction or before perceptual monitoring. Although interval and ordinal information led to activations within the same neural network, direct comparisons revealed significant differences. The pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA), the lateral PMC, the frontal opercular cortex as well as basal ganglia and the left lateral cerebellar cortex (CE) were activated significantly more strongly by interval information, whereas the SMA, the frontal eye field, the primary motor cortex (MI), the primary somatosensory cortex, the cuneus as well as the medial CE and the thalamus were activated more strongly by ordinal information, In addition, serial encoding before reproduction led to higher activations than serial encoding before monitoring in the preSMA, SMA, MI and medial CE.

These circuits predominantly connect primary and secondary visual cortex with the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Although there are direct geniculocortical inputs to extrastriate visual cortex, whether reciprocal corticogeniculate neurons exist in extrastriate cortex is not known. Here we utilized virus-mediated retrograde tracing to reveal the presence of corticogeniculate neurons in three mid-level extrastriate visual cortical areas in ferrets: PMLS, PLLS, and 21a. We observed corticogeniculate neurons in all three extrastriate areas, although the density of virus-labeled corticogeniculate neurons in extrastriate cortex was an order of magnitude less than that in areas 17 and 18. A cluster analysis of morphological metrics quantified following reconstructions of the full dendritic arborizations of virus-labeled corticogeniculate neurons revealed six distinct cell types. Similar corticogeniculate cell types to those observed in areas 17 and 18 were also observed in PMLS, PLLS, and 21a. However, these unique cell types were not equally distributed across the three extrastriate areas. The majority of corticogeniculate neurons per cluster originated in a single area, suggesting unique parallel organizations for corticogeniculate feedback from each extrastriate area to the LGN. Together, our findings demonstrate direct feedback connections from mid-level extrastriate visual cortex to the LGN, supporting complementary reciprocal circuits at multiple processing stages along the visual hierarchy. Importantly, direct reciprocal connections between the LGN and extrastriate cortex, that bypass V1, could provide a substrate for residual vision following V1 damage.",Corticogeniculate; LGN; PMLS; PLLS; Area 21a; Feedback; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; MIDDLE TEMPORAL AREA; INDIVIDUAL X-CELL; STRIATE CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; SUBLAMINAR ORGANIZATION; RESPONSE PROPERTIES; LAYER-VI; NEURONS; PROJECTIONS

This coincides with the arrival of parvocellular signals en route to the ventral pathway and infero-temporal cortex. Such evidence suggests that the dorsal stream region V5/MT+ is activated rapidly through the traditional hierarchical pathway and also via a less-well-established direct signal to V5/MT+ bypassing V1. To test this, 16 healthy humans underwent transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of V1/V2 and V5/MT+ while performing a motion-direction detection task. A three-alternate forced-choice design (left/right motion, stationary) allowed analysis of the quality of errors made, in addition to the more usual performance measures. Transient disruption of V1/V2 and V5/MT+ significantly reduced accuracy when TMS was applied at or near motion onset. Most participants also showed disrupted performance with TMS application over V1/V2 similar to 125 ms post motion onset, and significantly reduced accuracy at 158 ms with V5/MT+ stimulation. The two periods of disruption with V1/V2 TMS are suggestive of feedforward/feedback models, although the earlier period of disruption has not been reported in previous TMS studies. Very early activation of V5/MT+, evidenced by diminished accuracy and reduced perception of motion after TMS may be indicative of a thalamic-extrastriate pathway in addition to the traditionally expected later period of processing. A profound disruption of performance prestimulus onset is more likely to reflect disruption of top-down expectancy than disruption of visual processing.",nan; TRANSCRANIAL MAGNETIC STIMULATION; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; TOP-DOWN FACILITATION; HUMAN AREA V5; MACAQUE MONKEY; STRIATE CORTEX; RESPONSE LATENCIES; TEMPORAL CHARACTERISTICS; EXTRASTRIATE CORTEX; OCCIPITAL CORTEX

Little is known about cuneate functional organization in primates or about how cuneate and area 3b organization are related. In this study, neurophysiologic approaches were used to evaluate how tactile inputs from the hand and adjacent body are organized in the cuneate nucleus of squirrel monkeys. Cuneate data on the organization of hand inputs were then compared with analogous area 3b data from our earlier cortical studies that used the same approaches. Evaluations of several cuneate properties, including (1) responsiveness to tactile stimulation, (2) incidences and sizes of receptive fields, (3) somatotopic progressions, (4) properties of representations, and (5) relationships between functional inputs and cytochrome oxidase staining, suggest that tactile afferents from the hand form consistently organized cuneate representations that, in turn, relate to the parcellated organization of cuneate structural substrates. Comparisons of cuneate and area 3b organization indicate that tactile processing from the brainstem to cortex involves a preservation of tactile responsiveness and somatotopic organization but, in addition, involves transformations that produce receptive field sharpening, suppression of hairy hand inputs, amplification and refinement of glabrous inputs, and relocations of representations. Ascending lemniscal substrates are characterized by cascading excitatory convergence/divergence that increments at successively higher levels between sensory afferents and area 3b. It is suggested that the observed preservations and transformations reflect this organization but, in addition, reflect mechanisms that cause counterbalancing sharpening and suppressions of hand inputs.

Neural circuit mechanisms based on neuronal and synaptic properties have been shown to process temporal information over the range of tens of microseconds to hundreds of milliseconds(5-7). How neural circuits process temporal information in the range of seconds to minutes is much less understood. Studies of working memory in monkeys and rats have shown that neurons in the prefrontal cortex(8-10), the parietal cortex(9,11) and the thalamus(12) exhibit ramping activities that linearly correlate with the lapse of time until the end of a specific time interval of several seconds that the animal is trained to memorize. Many organisms can also memorize the time interval of rhythmic sensory stimuli in the timescale of seconds and can coordinate motor behaviour accordingly, for example, by keeping the rhythm after exposure to the beat of music. Here we report a form of rhythmic activity among specific neuronal ensembles in the zebrafish optic tectum, which retains the memory of the time interval ( in the order of seconds) of repetitive sensory stimuli for a duration of up to similar to 20 s. After repetitive visual conditioning stimulation ( CS) of zebrafish larvae, we observed rhythmic post-CS activities among specific tectal neuronal ensembles, with a regular interval that closely matched the CS. Visuomotor behaviour of the zebrafish larvae also showed regular post- CS repetitions at the entrained time interval that correlated with rhythmic neuronal ensemble activities in the tectum. Thus, rhythmic activities among specific neuronal ensembles may act as an adjustable 'metronome' for time intervals in the order of seconds, and serve as a mechanism for the short- term perceptual memory of rhythmic sensory experience.",nan; EVENT-RELATED POTENTIALS; IN-VIVO; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; LARVAL ZEBRAFISH; OPTIC TECTUM; PSYCHOPHYSICS; NETWORKS; PROTEIN; MACAQUE; RETINA

In the tectorotundal system, neurons of the stratum griseum centrale (SGC) of the optic tectum send their axons bilaterally to the nucleus rotundus (Rt). In transit to the Rt, the axons of the SGC neurons collateralize in the nuclei posteroventralis thalami (PV), subpretectalis (SP), and interstitiopretectosubpretectalis (IPS) of the tectothalamic tract (TT). The current study used birthdating and pathway-tracing methods to investigate the neurogenesis and time course of neuronal connections of the tectorotundal pathway in chicks during embryogenesis. By using tritiated thymidine autoradiography, we observed that the SGC neurons of the tectum were generated by embryonic days 3.0-5.5 (E3.0-E5.5), the Rt by E3.5-E5.0, and the nuclei of TT by E3.5-4.5. To trace the tectorotundal pathway, we injected cholera toxin B subunit (CTb) into the tectum, and the CTb-like immunoreactivity was examined. By E4.5-E5.5, some CTb-like immunoreactive (CTb-LI) axons terminated in the ipsilateral SP/IPS. By E6.0-E6.5, CTb-LI axon bundles were seen ipsilaterally in the TT. Increased numbers of labeled axons were seen terminating in the SP/IPS. By E7.0-E7.5, heavily labeled axons in the TT were observed with diffuse terminals in areas ventral to the presumptive Rt and PV. By E7.5-E8.0, the tectal axons innervated the ipsilateral Rt, in which some of the collaterals crossed the midline to the contralateral diencephalon. The crossed tectorotundal projection was seen first by E8.0-E8.5. Also, during this stage, a few CTb-LI collaterals terminated in the contralateral SP/IPS. Between E10 and. E13, the pattern of bilateral tectorotundal projections became more regionalized, whereas labeling continued to increase in the SP/IPS. At E16, the labeling pattern of all tectorecipient structures resembled that of the hatchling. The current study revealed the temporal order of development of the tectorotundal pathway during embryogenesis. The SGC cells first innervate ipsilaterally the SP/IPS and then the Rt/PV. The schedule of the crossed tectorotundal connections coincides with the schedule of tectal projections onto the contralateral intrinsic nuclei of the TT. We conclude that E8.0 (+/-E0.5) is a critical stage for the development of the tectofugal pathway. Moreover, the current study provides important insights into the relative ontogeny of the mammalian tectofugal pathway. J. Comp. Neurol. 417:115-132, 2000.

Evidence from cytoarchitectonic, stimulation, and functional studies suggests structural and functional divergence between the two subregions. However, a microstructural map of these areas obtained in a representative sample of brains in a stereotaxic reference space is still lacking. In the present study we show that the dorsal mesial frontal motor cortex comprises two microstructurally different brain regions: area SMA and area pre-SMA. Area-specific cytoarchitectonic patterns were studied in serial histological sections stained for cell bodies of ten human postmortem brains. Borders of the two cortical areas were identified using image analysis and statistical features. The 3D reconstructed areas were transferred to a common reference space, and probabilistic maps were calculated by superimposing the individual maps. A coordinate-based meta-analysis of functional imaging data was subsequently performed using the two probabilistic maps as microstructurally defined seed regions. It revealed that areas SMA and pre-SMA were strongly co-activated with areas in precentral, supramarginal and superior frontal gyri, Rolandic operculum, thalamus, putamen and cerebellum. Both areas were related to motor functions, but area pre-SMA was involved in more complex processes such as learning, cognitive processes and perception. The here described subsequent analyses led to converging evidence supporting the microstructural, and functional segregation of areas SMA and pre-SMA, and maps will be made available to the scientific community to further elucidate the microstructural substrates of motor and cognitive control.",Supplementary motor area; Pre-supplementary motor area; Cytoarchitectonic mapping; Quantitative cytoarchitectonics; Probability maps; Meta-analytic connectivity modeling; ADJACENT CINGULATE CORTEX; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; INTRACORTICAL MICROSTIMULATION; SOMATOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; COGNITIVE CONTROL; NEGATIVE AFFECT; MACAQUE MONKEY; CORTICAL AREAS; MESIAL AREA-6; BASAL GANGLIA

Both areas received their main thalamic inputs from the ventral anterior and ventral lateral complexes, and received dense projections from the medial premotor cortex. However, there were marked differences in their connections with other cortical areas. While 6DR received consistent inputs from prefrontal cortex, area 6DC received few such connections. Conversely, 6DC, but not 6DR, received major projections from the primary motor and somatosensory areas. Projections from the anterior cingulate cortex preferentially targeted 6DC, while the posterior cingulate and adjacent medial wall areas preferentially targeted 6DR. Projections from the medial parietal area PE to 6DC were particularly dense, while intraparietal areas (especially the putative homolog of LIP) were more strongly labeled after 6DR injections. Finally, 6DC and 6DR were distinct in terms of inputs from the ventral parietal cortex: projections to 6DR originated preferentially from caudal areas (PG and OPt), while 6DC received input primarily from rostral areas (PF and PFG). Differences in connections suggest that area 6DR includes rostral and caudal subdivisions, with the former also involved in oculomotor control. These results suggest that area 6DC is more directly involved in the preparation and execution of motor acts, while area 6DR integrates sensory and internally driven inputs for the planning of goal-directed actions. They also provide strong evidence of a homologous organization of the dorsal premotor cortex in New and Old World monkeys. J. Comp. Neurol. 522:3683-3716, 2014.

This study investigated the novel GLP-1R-Cre mouse as a functional tool to address this question. Methods: Mice expressing Cre-recombinase under the Glp1r promoter were crossed with either a ROSA26 eYFP or tdRFP reporter strain to identify GLP-1R expressing cells. Patch-clamp recordings were performed on tdRFP-positive neurons in acute coronal brain slices from adult mice and selective targeting of GLP-1R cells in vivo was achieved using viral gene delivery. Results: Large numbers of eYFP or tdRFP immunoreactive cells were found in the circumventricular organs, amygdala, hypothalamic nuclei and the ventrolateral medulla. Smaller numbers were observed in the nucleus of the solitary tract and the thalamic paraventricular nucleus. However, tdRFP positive neurons were also found in areas without preproglucagon-neuronal projections like hippocampus and cortex. GLP-1R cells were not immunoreactive for GFAP or parvalbumin although some were catecholaminergic. GLP-1R expression was confirmed in whole-cell recordings from BNST, hippocampus and PVN, where 100 nM GLP-1 elicited a reversible inward current or depolarisation. Additionally, a unilateral stereotaxic injection of a cre-dependent AAV into the PVN demonstrated that tdRFP-positive cells express cre-recombinase facilitating virally-mediated eYFP expression. Conclusions: This study is a comprehensive description and phenotypic analysis of GLP-1R expression in the mouse CNS. We demonstrate the power of combining the GLP-1R-CRE mouse with a virus to generate a selective molecular handle enabling future in vivo investigation as to their physiological importance.

Dexmedetomidine (DEX), a selective alpha 2-adrenoreceptor agonist, has antiapoptotic properties in several brain injury models. Here, we tested whether DEX can protect the brain from neurodegeneration in rats exposed to propofol in utero. Materials and Methods: Fetal rats of embryonic day 20 were exposed in utero for 1 hour to propofol anesthesia with DEX or saline, or no anesthesia (control). The fetal brains were harvested 6 hours later. Cleaved caspase-3 levels and the relative number of ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (IBA1)-positive cells were assessed by Western blot and immunohistochemistry. Learning and memory functions of the offspring in a separate cohort were assessed at postnatal day 35 by using an 8-arm radial maze. Results: Propofol anesthesia in pregnant rats augmented caspase-3 activation by 217% in the brain tissues of fetal rats and increased the number of IBA1-positive cells in the cortex by 40% and in the thalamus by 270%. Juvenile rats exposed pre-natally to propofol were not different than controls on spontaneous locomotor activity, but made more errors of omission and took longer to complete visiting all 8 arms on days 1, 2, and 3 across a 5-day test in the radial arm maze. This neurocognitive deficit was prevented by administration of DEX (5.0 mu g/kg, IP), which also significantly inhibited propofol-induced caspase-3 activation and microglial response in the fetal brains. Conclusions: DEX attenuates neuronal injury induced by maternal propofol anesthesia in the fetal brains, providing neurocognitive protection in the offspring rats.",propofol; dexmedetomidine; neuroapoptosis; neurocognitive deficit; developing brain; microglial cells; RHESUS MACAQUE BRAIN; SPINAL GLIAL ACTIVATION; INDUCED NEUROAPOPTOSIS; APOPTOTIC NEURODEGENERATION; BEHAVIORAL DEFICITS; NEONATAL EXPOSURE; MOUSE-BRAIN; RAT-BRAIN; FETAL; ISOFLURANE

Such studies do not, however, reveal which particular cell types within the S1 cortex receive direct monosynaptic connections from these input sources. Here we describe the monosynaptic inputs to a subpopulation of mouse S1 inhibitory neurons that express ErbB4. We used a previously described bridge protein,'' composed of the ErbB4 ligand, neuregulin (NRG1), fused to the avian viral receptor TVB (TVB-NRG1), along with EnvB pseudotyped lentivirus (LV) and rabies virus (RV), to selectively coinfect ErbB4-expressing neurons (Choi et al. [2010] Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A 107:16703-16708). The RV had its glycoprotein gene deleted and replaced with mCherry, so that infected cells express mCherry and the virus cannot spread without provision of rabies glycoprotein (RG) by transcomplementation. The LV encoded and expressed RG to allow transcomplementation in coinfected neurons, so that the RV could spread transsynaptically and label their direct monosynaptic inputs. The RV could not spread beyond the direct inputs, due to the lack of RG in presynaptic cells. This method revealed long-range connections from thalamus, nucleus basalis, raphe, and distant cortical areas, including ipsilateral motor, secondary somatosensory, retrosplenial, and perirhinal cortex and contralateral S1. In addition, local connections from ipsilateral pyramidal neurons within S1 were labeled. These input sources account for all of the known inputs to S1 described with standard tracers, suggesting that the subpopulation of ErbB4-positive inhibitory neurons infected using the TVB-NRG1 bridge protein receives inputs indiscriminately from S1 input sources.

Recent neuroimaging studies have demonstrated that sympathetic outflow to the heart is modulated by the activity of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). However, the cortical modulation of cardiovagal activity is still unclear in humans. The present study used functional MRI to investigate the cortical network involved in cardiovagal control. Seventeen healthy individuals performed graded handgrip exercise while heart rate (HR) and cortical activity were recorded. Muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and HR were measured while participants repeated the same protocol in a parallel experiment session. The handgrip exercise elevated HR and MAP without concurrent elevations in MSNA supporting earlier conclusions that the cardiovascular responses are mainly modulated by vagal withdrawal. The imaging data showed activation in the insular cortex, thalamus, parietal cortices and cerebellum during the exercise period. Consistently across all the participants, the HR response correlated with the deactivation in the ventral medial prefrontal cortex (vMPFC), which has substantial anatomical connection with the subcortical autonomic structures. The deactivation of the vMPFC was independent of the motor control and was observed commonly in both left and right hand exercise. Stronger vMPFC deactivation was observed when participants completed a higher intensity exercise that elicited a larger HR response. Our findings support the hypothesis that the vMPFC is involved in modulating the vagal efferent outflow to the heart and the suppression of its activity elevates cardiovascular arousal in conscious humans.

For example, our movements while driving a car can be instructed by color cues that we see on traffic lights. These stimuli do not spatially relate to the actions that they specify. Associations between these stimuli and actions are called arbitrary visuomotor conditional associations. Earlier fMRI studies have tried to dissociate the sensory and motor components of these associations by introducing delays between the presentation of arbitrary cues and go-signals that instructed participants to perform actions. This approach, however, also introduces neural processes that are not necessarily related to the normal real-time production of arbitrary visuomotor responses, such as working memory and the suppression of motor responses. We used fMRI adaptation as an alternative approach to dissociate sensory and motor components. We found that visual areas in the occipital-temporal cortex adapted only to the presentation of arbitrary visual cues whereas a number of sensorimotor areas adapted only to the production of response. Visual areas in the occipital-temporal cortex do not have any known connections with parts of the brain that can control hand musculature. Therefore, it is conceivable that the brain areas that we report as having adapted to both stimulus presentation and response production (namely, the dorsal premotor area, the supplementary motor area, the cingulate, the anterior intra-parietal sulcus area, and the thalamus) are involved in the multiple steps between processing visual stimuli and activating the motor commands that these cues specify.

Functional deficits caused by nerve injuries can be compensated by reinnervation of denervated targets by regenerating injured axons or by collateral branching Of undamaged axons, and remodeling of nervous system circuitry related to the lost functions. Plasticity of central connections may compensate functionally for the lack of adequate tat-get reinnervation; however, plasticity has limited effects on disturbed sensory localization or fine motor control after injuries, and may even result in maladaptive changes, Such as neuropathic pain and hyperreflexia. After axotomy, neurons shift from a transmitter to a regenerative phenotype, activating molecular pathways that promote neuronal survival and axonal regeneration. Peripheral nerve injuries also induce a cascade of events, at the Molecular, cellular, and system levels, initiated by the injury and progressing throughout plastic changes at the spinal cord, brainstem nuclei, thalamus, and brain cortex. Mechanisms involved in these changes include neurochemical changes, functional alterations of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic connections, sprouting of new connections, and reorganization of sensory and motor central maps. An important direction for research is the development of therapeutic strategies that enhance axonal regeneration, promote selective target reinnervation, and are also able to modulate central nervous system reorganization, amplifying positive adaptive changes that improve functional recovery and also reducing undesirable effects.",nan; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; PRIMARY SENSORY NEURONS; ADULT MACAQUE MONKEYS; ROOT GANGLION NEURONS; RAT SPINAL-CORD; DENDRITIC ARBORIZATION PATTERNS; REORGANIZATION FOLLOWING MOTOR; GATED SODIUM-CHANNELS; GENE-RELATED PEPTIDE; PERIPHERAL-NERVE

Previous studies have attempted to describe the ontogeny of cerebral glucose metabolism in anesthetized nonhuman primates using [F-18]fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) and PET. However, the use of sedation during the tracer uptake period may influence 1CMR(glc). This study was conducted to describe 1CMR(glc) in conscious infant vervet monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops sabaeus) during the first year of life utilizing FDG-PET. Cross-sectional studies (n = 23) displayed lowest and highest 1CMR(glc) in all structures at the 2-3 and 8-9 month age groups, respectively. The metabolic pattern suggested an increase in 1CMR(glc) values between 2 and 8 months of age with decreased metabolism observed at 10-12 months of age in all regions. Peak 1CMR(glc) values at 8 months were an average of 84+/-24% higher than values seen at the youngest age examined quantitatively (2-3 months). The regions of greatest and smallest increases in 1CMR(glc) at 8 months were the cerebellar hemispheres (90%) and the thalamus (39%), respectively. Longitudinal analysis in 4 animals supported this developmental pattern, demonstrating the ability to detect changes in cerebral glucose metabolism within animals and the potential for FDG-PET in nonhuman primate models of brain maturation. By determining the normative profile of 1CMR(glc) during development in monkeys, future application of FDG-PET will provide the opportunity to longitudinally assess the effects of environmental or pharmacological intervention on the immature brain.

Complementary DNAs corresponding to the pharmacologically defined mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptors have been isolated in various species including man. The expression patterns of opioid receptor transcripts in human brain has not bean established with a cellular resolution, in part because of the low apparent abundance of opioid receptor messenger RNAs in human brain. To visualize opioid receptor messenger RNAs we developed a sensitive in situ hybridization histochemistry method using P-33-labelled RNA probes. In the present study we report the regional and cellular expression of mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptor messenger RNAs in selected areas of the human brain. Hybridization of the different opioid receptor probes resulted in distinct labelling patterns. For the mu and kappa opioid receptor probes, the most intense regional signals were observed in striatum, thalamus, hypothalamus, cerebral cortex, cerebellum and certain brainstem areas as well as the spinal cord. The most intense signals for the delta opioid receptor probe were found in cerebral cortex. Expression of opioid receptor transcripts was restricted to subpopulations of neurons within most regions studied demonstrating differences in the cellular expression patterns of mu, kappa, and delta opioid receptor messenger RNAs in numerous brain regions. The messenger RNA distribution patterns for each opioid receptor corresponded in general to the distribution of opioid receptor binding sites as visualized by receptor autoradiography. However, some mismatches, for instance between mu opioid receptor receptor binding and mu opioid receptor messenger RNA expression in the anterior striatum, were observed. A comparison of the distribution patterns of opioid receptor messenger RNAs in the human brain and that reported for the rat suggests a homologous expression pattern in many regions. However, in the human brain, kappa opioid receptor messenger RNA expression was more widely distributed than in rodents. The differential and region specific expression of opioid receptors may help to identify targets for receptor specific compounds in neuronal circuits involved in a variety of physiological functions including pain perception, neuroendocrine regulation, motor control and reward.

This has, however, only been tested in relation to the timing and preparation of motor responses, but not to ongoing movement control. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the present study addressed the neuroanatomical substrate of the internal-external control hypothesis by comparing regional brain activation for cyclical bimanual movements performed in the presence or absence of augmented visual feedback. Subjects performed a bimanual movement pattern, either with the help of on-line visual feedback of the movements (externally guided coordination) or with the eyes closed on the basis of an internal representation of the movement pattern (internally generated coordination). Visual control and baseline rest conditions were also added. Results showed a clear functional dissociation within the network involved in movement coordination. The hMT/V5+, the superior parietal cortex, the premotor cortex, the thalamus, and cerebellar lobule VI showed higher activation levels when movements were guided by visual feedback. Conversely, the basal ganglia, the supplementary motor area, cingulate motor cortex, the inferior parietal, frontal operculum, and cerebellar lobule IV-V/dentate nucleus showed higher involvement when movements were internally generated. Consequently, the present findings suggest the existence of distinct cortico-cortical and subcortico-cortical neural pathways for externally (augmented feedback) and internally guided cyclical bimanual movements. This provides a neurophysiological account for the beneficial effect of providing augmented visual feedback to optimize movements in normal and motor disordered patients.

He experimented quantitatively on basic properties of cell membranes, synapses, transmitters, cellular modules, reflexes, and plasticity. In parallel, he was also motivated to consider philosophical problems of mind-brain interactions. It was mostly during Eccles' Swiss period (1976-1997) that new experimental work advanced understanding of intentional motor actions and their preparation. For example, early brain imaging work suggested that the so-called supplementary motor area was rather a supramotor area, concerned with intentional preparation to move. Eccles also closely followed work on cortico-cerebellar integration and learning. His final contribution, in collaboration with the quantum physicist, Friedrich Beck, was a model of how specific neuronal modules interact with the mind. Being a declared dualist, Eccles encountered considerable resistance and skepticism among neuroscientists in accepting his experimentally untestable mind-brain theories. But one can only admire the remarkable continuity of effort in his search for modular operations of identified neurons in the central nervous system and their synaptic actions. This effort was facilitated by collaboration with the eminent anatomist, Janos Szentagothai, who had previously helped Eccles advance understanding of spinal and cerebellar circuitry. This review also includes some personal views on current understanding of the forebrain, with an emphasis on the multiplicity of cortical modules, all of which contribute in the mental preparation for forthcoming intentional actions.

Here, we review existing anatomical data on the interaction between the BG and the limbic system that support implication of the BG in limbic functions. State of the art. - The BG form a system that is fairly different from the limbic system, but have strong ties, both anatomical and functional, to the latter. Different models have been proposed. In the parallel model, five segregated circuits from the frontal cortex are individualized and terminate in different regions of the BG and thalamus, before projecting back to their cortical area of origin. Based on the extrafrontal cortical projections, another model has been proposed. It subdivides the cortico-striatal projection into three functional territories: limbic, associative and sensorimotor. In a third spiral model, propagation is possible between limbic information processed by the most medial striatal neurons to motor information processed by the most lateral neurons. Perspectives. - Three main levels of interaction between the BG system and the limbic system are considered. (1) The BC receive direct afferences from several structures associated with the limbic system. Limbic cortical areas project to the striatum, of which the internal architecture is particularly complex, with significant cross-species differences: a compartmental striosome/matrix subdivision described mainly in primates, and a core/shell topographic subdivision of the nucleus accumbens more sharply marked in rodents. (2) Projections from the amygdala form a patchy dorso-ventral progressive gradient in the nucleus accumbens and ventral caudate. (3) Both shell and striosomes receive limbic information from cortical and subcortical limbic structures and project to the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars compacta, which in turn modulates their activity. (4) There is a significant overlap between the ventral portions of the BC, nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum, and the ventral subcortical structures of the limbic system, extended amygdala and nucleus basalis. Conclusion. - Important interactions exist between the limbic system and the BC system but questions remain about the role that this information plays in the functional organisation of this system. Is limbic information processed separately in the BC, or is it integrated to motor and cognitive information? Do pathological conditions such as obsessive-compulsive disorders or Tourette syndrome result from abnormal afferent limbic input to the BG or abnormal processing within the BC?

In most preclinical studies, animals are anesthetized during image acquisition to minimize movement. However, it has been demonstrated anesthesia could attenuate basal neuronal activity, which can confound interpretation of drug-induced brain activation patterns. Significant efforts have been made to establish awake imaging in rodents and nonhuman primates (NHP). Whilst various platforms have been developed for imaging awake NHP, comparison and validation of phMRI data as translational biomarkers across species remain to be explored. Methodology: We have established an awake NHP imaging model that encompasses comprehensive acclimation procedures with a dedicated animal restrainer. Using a cerebral blood volume (CBV)-based phMRI approach, we have determined differential responses of brain activation elicited by the systemic administration of buprenorphine (0.03 mg/kg i.v.), a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist, in the same animal under awake and anesthetized conditions. Additionally, region-of-interest analyses were performed to determine regional drug-induced CBV time-course data and corresponding area-under-curve (AUC) values from brain areas with high density of mu-opioid receptors. Principal Findings: In awake NHPs, group-level analyses revealed buprenorphine significantly activated brain regions including, thalamus, striatum, frontal and cingulate cortices (paired t-test, versus saline vehicle, p<0.05, n = 4). This observation is strikingly consistent with mu-opioid receptor distribution depicted by [6-O-[C-11] methyl] buprenorphine ([C-11]BPN) positron emission tomography imaging study in baboons. Furthermore, our findings are consistent with previous buprenorphine phMRI studies in humans and conscious rats which collectively demonstrate the cross-species translatability of awake imaging. Conversely, no significant change in activated brain regions was found in the same animals imaged under the anesthetized condition. Conclusions: Our data highlight the utility and importance of awake NHP imaging as a translational imaging biomarker for drug research.",nan; FUNCTIONAL MRI; DRUG DISCOVERY; CONTRAST AGENT; BRAIN ACTIVITY; FMRI; BOLD; PHARMACOKINETICS; ACTIVATION; MACAQUES; MONKEYS

Small bistratified cells ( SBCs), which form a major projection to the thalamus, exhibit blue-ON/yellow- OFF [ S- ON/( L + M)-OFF] light responses thought to be important for high- acuity color vision. However, the spatial processing properties of individual SBCs and their spatial arrangement across the visual field are poorly understood. The present study of peripheral primate retina reveals that contrary to previous suggestions, SBCs exhibit center- surround spatial structure, with the ( L + M)- OFF component of the receptive field similar to 50% larger in diameter than the S- ON component. Analysis of response kinetics shows that the ( L + M)-OFF response in SBCs is slower than the S- ON response and significantly less transient than that of simultaneously recorded OFF- parasol cells. The ( L + M)- OFF response in SBCs was eliminated by bath application of the metabotropic glutamate receptor agonist L- APB. These observations indicate that the ( L + M)- OFF response of SBCs is not formed by OFF- bipolar cell input as has been suspected and suggest that it arises from horizontal cell feedback. Finally, the receptive fields of SBCs form orderly mosaics, with overlap and regularity similar to those of ON- parasol cells. Thus, despite their distinctive morphology and chromatic properties, SBCs exhibit two features of other retinal ganglion cell types: center-surround antagonism and regular mosaic sampling of visual space.",receptive field; color; vision; APB; blue-yellow; opponent; nearest neighbor; center-surround; koniocellular; mosaic; CONE BIPOLAR CELLS; NEW-WORLD MONKEY; METABOTROPIC GLUTAMATE RECEPTORS; MARMOSET CALLITHRIX-JACCHUS; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; ROD-SIGNAL INTERNEURONS; MACAQUE RETINA; RABBIT RETINA; HORIZONTAL CELLS; CONTRAST SENSITIVITIES

Retrograde tracers were used to identify the sources of auditory cortical projections to primary visual cortex (areas 17 and 18) in adult cats. Two groups of animals were studied. In the first group, large deposits were centered on the lower visual field representation of the vertical meridian located along the area 17 and 18 border. Following tissue processing, characteristic patterns of cell body labeling were identified in extrastriate visual cortex and the visual thalamus (LGN, MIN, & LPl). In auditory cortex, of the four tonotopically-organized regions, neuronal labeling was identified in the supragranular layers of the posterior auditory field (PAF). Little to no labeling was evident in the primary auditory cortex, the anterior auditory field, the ventral posterior auditory field or in the remaining six non-tonotopically organized regions of auditory cortex. In the second group, small deposits were made into the central or peripheral visual field representations of primary visual cortex. Labeled cells were identified in PAF following deposits into regions of primary visual cortex representing peripheral, but not central, visual field representations. Furthermore, a coarse topography was identified in PAF, with neurons projecting to the upper field representation being located in the gyral portion of PAF and neurons projecting to the lower field representation located in the sulcal portion of PAF. Therefore, direct projections can be identified from tonotopically organized auditory cortex to the earliest stages of visual cortical processing.",area 17; area 18; auditory cortex; posterior auditory field; WGA-HRP; multisensory; cat; LATERAL POSTERIOR COMPLEX; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL SULCUS; ANTERIOR ECTOSYLVIAN SULCUS; VENTRAL INTRAPARIETAL AREA; CONGENITALLY BLIND HUMANS; CAT STRIATE CORTEX; RETINOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; MACAQUE MONKEY; CORTICAL CONNECTIONS; CORTICOCORTICAL CONNECTIONS

Neural activity was assessed in normal volunteers by changes in rCBF measured with PET. Thirteen right-handed subjects participated in three monocular tasks: (i) resting with eyes closed; (ii) sustained foveal fixation upon a LED at 1.2 m (0.83 D); and (iii) accommodating alternately on a near (24 cm, 4.16 D) vs. a far (3.0 m, 0.33 D) LED alternately illuminated in sequential 2 s epochs. The contrast between the conditions of near/far accommodation and of constant foveal fixation revealed activation in cerebellar hemispheres and vermis; middle and inferior temporal cortex (BA 20, 21, 37); striate cortex and associative visual areas (BA 17/18). Comparison of the condition of constant fixation with the condition of resting with closed eyes indicated activation of cerebellar hemispheres and vermis; visual cortices (BA 17/18); a right hemisphere dominant network encompassing prefrontal (BA 6, 9, 47), superior parietal (BA 7), and superior temporal (BA 40) cortices; and bilateral thalamus. The contrast between the conditions of near/far accommodation with closed-eye rest reflected an incremental summation of the activations found in the previous comparisons (i.e. activations associated with constant fixation). Neural circuits activated selectively during the near/far response to blur cues over those during constant visual fixation, occupy posterior structures that include occipital visual regions, cerebellar hemispheres and vermis, and temporal cortex.",accommodation; attention; blood flow; brain; brain mapping; eye movements; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; PUPILLARY LIGHT REFLEX; CEREBRAL-BLOOD-FLOW; LATERAL SUPRASYLVIAN AREA; TEMPORAL VISUAL AREA; SINGLE-UNIT ACTIVITY; MACAQUE MONKEY; CHROMATIC ABERRATION; CEREBELLAR CONTROL; PHORIA ADAPTATION

It is widely believed that this function extends to stopping cognitive processes as well. Consistent with this, mounting evidence establishes the role of the right lateral prefrontal cortex in a clear case of cognitive control: retrieval suppression. Retrieval suppression refers to the ability to intentionally stop the retrieval process that arises when a reminder to a memory appears. Functional imaging data indicate that retrieval suppression involves top-down modulation of hippocampal activity by the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, but the anatomical pathways supporting this inhibitory modulation remain unclear. Here we bridge this gap by integrating key findings about retrieval suppression observed through functional imaging with a detailed consideration of relevant anatomical pathways observed in non-human primates. Focusing selectively on the potential role of the anterior cingulate cortex, we develop two hypotheses about the pathways mediating interactions between lateral prefrontal cortex and the medial temporal lobes during suppression, and their cellular targets: the entorhinal gating hypothesis, and thalamo-hippocampal modulation via the nucleus reuniens. We hypothesize that whereas entorhinal gating is well situated to stop retrieval proactively, thalamo-hippocampal modulation may interrupt an ongoing act of retrieval reactively. Isolating the pathways that underlie retrieval suppression holds the potential to advance our understanding of a range of psychiatric disorders characterized by persistent intrusive thoughts. More broadly, an anatomical account of retrieval suppression would provide a key model system for understanding inhibitory control over cognition. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Inc.

These phenomena cannot be explained by the classical center-surround receptive field and have been ascribed to a variety of mechanisms, including feedback from cortex. We asked whether these phenomena might all be explained by a single mechanism, contrast gain control, which is inherited from retina and possibly strengthened in thalamus. We formalized an intuitive model of retinal contrast gain control that explicitly predicts gain as a function of local contrast. In the model, the output of the receptive field is divided by the output of a suppressive field, which computes the local root-mean-square contrast. The model provides good fits to LGN responses to a variety of stimuli; with a single set of parameters, it captures saturation, size tuning, and masking. It also correctly predicts that responses to small stimuli grow proportionally with contrast: were it not for the suppressive field, LGN responses would be linear. We characterized the suppressive field and found that it is similar in size to the surround of the classical receptive field ( which is eight times larger than commonly estimated), it is not selective for stimulus orientation, and it responds to a wide range of frequencies, including very low spatial frequencies and high temporal frequencies. The latter property is hardly consistent with feedback from cortex. These measurements thoroughly describe the visual properties of contrast gain control in LGN and provide a parsimonious explanation for disparate suppressive phenomena.",cat; gain control; receptive field; masking; adaptation; inhibition; RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; CONTRAST GAIN-CONTROL; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; EXTRACLASSICAL RECEPTIVE-FIELD; LENGTH RESPONSE PROPERTIES; LONG-RANGE INTERACTIONS; CAT STRIATE CORTEX; MACAQUE V1 NEURONS; RELAY CELLS; SPATIAL SUMMATION

Microelectrode recordings from these areas have shown that: (1) most of these cortical neurons are connected trisynaptically to the labyrinthine endorgans and (2) they receive converging vestibular, visual and somatosensory inputs. These data suggest that a multimodal cortical system is involved in postural and gaze control. In humans, recent positron emission tomography (PET) scans and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have largely confirmed these data. However, because of the limited temporal resolution of these two methods, the minimum time of arrival of labyrinthine inputs from the vestibular hair cells to these cortical areas has not yet been determined. In this study, we used the evoked potential method to attempt to answer this question. Due to its excellent temporal resolution, this method is ideal for the investigation of the tri- or polysynaptic nature of the vestibulocortical pathways. Eleven volunteer patients, who underwent a vestibular neurectomy due to intractable Meniere's disease (MD) or acoustic neurinoma resection, were included in this experiment. Patients were anesthetized and the vestibular nerve was electrically stimulated. The evoked potentials were recorded by 30 subcutaneous active electrodes located on the scalp. The brain electrical source imaging (BESA) program (version 2.0, 1995) was used to calculate dipole sources. The latency period for the activation of five distinct cortical zones, including the prefrontal and/or the frontal lobe, the ipsilateral temporoparietal cortex, the anterior portion of the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the contralateral parietal cortex, was 6 ms. The short latency period recorded for each of these areas indicates that several trisynaptic pathways, passing through the vestibular nuclei and the thalamic neurons, link the primary vestibular afferents to the cortex. We suggest that all these areas, including the prefrontal area, process egomotion information and may be involved in planning motor synergies to counteract loss of equilibrium.",vestibular evoked potentials; vestibular cortical areas; electrical stimulation; vestibular nerve; frontal cortex; MONKEYS MACACA-FASCICULARIS; MEMORY-GUIDED SACCADES; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; CORTICAL CONTROL; FUNCTIONAL MRI; LATENCY; STIMULATION; ACTIVATION; RESPONSES; AREAS

We sought to evaluate the specificity and extent of volume loss-of the major forebrain regions in epileptic rats months after kainate-induced status epilepticus. In systematic series of Nissl-stained sections, the areas of major forebrain regions were measured, and volumes were estimated using the Cavalieri principle. In some regions, the optical fractionator method was used to estimate neuron numbers. Most kainate-treated rats showed significant volume loss in the amygdala, olfactory cortex, and septal region, but others displayed different patterns, with significant loss only in the hippocampus or thalamus, for example. Average volume loss was most severe in the amygdala and olfactory cortex (82-83% of controls), especially the caudal parts of both regions. In the piriform cortex (including the endopiriform nucleus) of epileptic rats, an average of approximately one-third of Nissl-stained neurons and one-third of the GABAergic interneurons labeled by in situ hybridization for GAD67 mRNA were lost, and the extent of neuron loss was correlated with the extent of volume loss. Volumetric analysis of major forebrain regions was insensitive to specific neuron loss in subregions such as layer III of the entorhinal cortex and the hilus of the dentate gyrus. These findings provide quantitative evidence that kainate-treated rats tend to display extensive neuron and volume loss in the amygdala and olfactory cortex, although the patterns and extent of loss in forebrain regions vary considerably among individuals. In this status epilepticus-based model, extrahippocampal damage appears to be more extensive and hippocampal damage appears to be less extensive than that reported for patients with temporal lobe epilepsy.

We aimed to define the development of such cortical reorganisation by comparing data from patients with different disease phenotypes. Methods We studied patients with different phenotypes of MS: 16 patients with a clinically isolated syndrome (CIS), 14 patients with relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS) and no disability, 15 patients with RRMS and mild clinical disability, and 12 patients with secondary progressive MS (SPMS). Patients did a simple motor task with their unimpaired dominant hand during MRI, which was compared across the phenotype groups. Findings Patients with a CIS activated more of the contralateral primary sensorimotor cortex than those with RRMS and no disability, whereas patients with RRMS and no disability activated more of the supplementary motor area than those with a CIS. Patients with RRMS and no disability activated more of the primary sensorimotor cortex, bilaterally, and more of the ipsilateral supplementary motor area than patients with RRMS and mild clinical disability. Conversely, patients with RRMS and mild clinical disability activated more of the contralateral. secondary somatosensory cortex and inferior frontal gyrus, and the ipsilateral precuneus. Patients with RRMS and mild clinical disability activated more of the contralateral thalamus and of the ipsilateral secondary somatosensory cortex than those with SPMS. However, patients with SPMS activated more of the inferior frontal gyrus, bilaterally, the middle frontal gyrus, bilaterally, the contralateral precuneus, and the ipsilateral cingulate motor area and inferior parietal lobule. Interpretation Movement-associated cortical reorganisation in patients with MS seems to vary across individuals at different stages of disease. Our study suggests that early in the disease course more areas typically devoted to motor tasks are recruited. Then bilateral activation of these regions is seen, and late in the disease course, areas that healthy people recruit to do novel or complex tasks are activated.",nan; SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA; MULTIPLE-SCLEROSIS; BRAIN REORGANIZATION; ACTIVATION PATTERNS; OBJECT MANIPULATION; MACAQUE MONKEYS; PARIETAL CORTEX; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; BASAL GANGLIA; MEDIAL WALL

Instead, we find that the pulvinar is involved in contralateral response activation, especially under conditions of response competition, and contralateral spatial coding of visual features.

We completed this trial to determine if smoking cessation decreases the progression of cognitive decline in later life. Methods: We recruited older smokers (n = 229) and never smokers (n = 98) and invited smokers to join a smoking cessation trial. The primary outcome of interest was change in Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale cognitive subscale (ADAS-cog) scores over 24 months. Secondary measures included the Logical Memory test and changes in gray matter density. Successful smoking cessation was defined as a minimum of 547 smoking free days during follow up. Results: The ADAS-cog scores of unsuccessful quitters (UQ) increased (i.e., became worse) 1.1 +/- 0.3 and 1.2 +/- 0.4 points more than the scores of never smokers (NS) (p = 0.001) and successful quitters (SQ) (p = 0.006) respectively over the 24 months of follow up. Similarly, the scores of UQ declined (i.e., became worse) relative to NS on measures of immediate (p = 0.004) and delayed recall (p = 0.029). All analyses were adjusted for age, years of education, baseline cognitive performance, alcohol use, depression scores, and the presence of chronic respiratory disease. Thirty-six NS, 18 SQ and 48 UQ completed the imaging substudy. Compared with NS, UQ showed a disproportional loss of gray matter density in the right thalamus, right and left inferior semi-lunar lobule, as well as left superior and inferior parietal lobule over 24 months. SQ showed loss of gray matter compared with NS in the right middle and inferior occipital gyri, right and left culmen, and the left superior frontal gyrus. We did not find any brain regions in which UQ had lost more gray matter than SQ over 2 years. Conclusion: These results are consistent with the hypothesis that smoking causes cognitive decline and loss of gray matter tissue in the brain over time. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

To examine the SN's involvement in sympathetic outflow, we tested the hypothesis that individual differences in intrinsic connectivity of the SN correlate positively with resting postganglionic muscle sympathetic nerve activity (MSNA) burst incidence (BI) in subjects without and with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). Overnight polysomnography, 5-min rsMRI, and fibular MSNA recording were performed in 36 subjects (mean age 57 yr; 10 women, 26 men). Independent component analysis (ICA) of the entire cohort identified the SN as including bilateral IC, pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC), midcingulate cortex (MCC), and the temporoparietal junction (TPJ). There was a positive correlation between BI and the apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) (P < 0.001), but dual-regression analysis identified no differences in SN functional connectivity between subjects with no or mild OSA (n = 17) and moderate or severe (n = 19) OSA. Correlation analysis relating BI to the strength of connectivity within the SN revealed large (i.e., spatial extent) and strong correlations for the left IC (P < 0.001), right pgACC/MCC (P < 0.006), left TPJ (P < 0.004), thalamus (P < 0.035), and cerebellum (P < 0.013). Indexes of sleep apnea were unrelated to BI and the strength of SN connectivity. There were no relationships between BI and default or sensorimotor network connectivity.

Spatiotemporal properties of vestibular responses in area MSTd. J Neurophysiol 104: 1506-1522, 2010. First published July 14, 2010; doi: 10.1152/jn.91247.2008. Recent studies have shown that many neurons in the primate dorsal medial superior temporal area (MSTd) show spatial tuning during inertial motion and that these responses are vestibular in origin. Given their well-studied role in processing visual self-motion cues (i.e., optic flow), these neurons may be involved in the integration of visual and vestibular signals to facilitate robust perception of self-motion. However, the temporal structure of vestibular responses in MSTd has not been characterized in detail. Specifically, it is not known whether MSTd neurons encode velocity, acceleration, or some combination of motion parameters not explicitly encoded by vestibular afferents. In this study, we have applied a frequency-domain analysis to single-unit responses during translation in three dimensions (3D). The analysis quantifies the stimulus-driven temporal modulation of each response as well as the degree to which this modulation reflects the velocity and/or acceleration profile of the stimulus. We show that MSTd neurons signal a combination of velocity and acceleration components with the velocity component being stronger for most neurons. These two components can exist both within and across motion directions, although their spatial tuning did not show a systematic relationship across the population. From these results, vestibular responses in MSTd appear to show characteristic features of spatiotemporal convergence, similar to previous findings in the brain stem and thalamus. The predominance of velocity encoding in this region may reflect the suitability of these signals to be integrated with visual signals regarding self-motion perception.",nan; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL AREA; OPTIC FLOW STIMULI; HEADING PERCEPTION; SELF-MOTION; LINEAR ACCELERATION; SPATIAL PROPERTIES; VIEWING DISTANCE; OCULAR RESPONSES; PRIMARY AFFERENT; MACAQUE MONKEYS

The adaptive labeling of the world is critically dependent on the neocortex which in turn is modulated by a range of subcortical systems such as the thalamus, ventral striatum, and the amygdala. A particular case in point is the learning paradigm of classical conditioning where acquired representations of states of the world such as sounds and visual features are associated with predefined discrete behavioral responses such as eye blinks and freezing. Learning progresses in a very specific order, where the animal first identifies the features of the task that are predictive of a motivational state and then forms the association of the current sensory state with a particular action and shapes this action to the specific contingency. This adaptive feature selection has both attentional and memory components, i.e., a behaviorally relevant state must be detected while its representation must be stabilized to allow its interfacing to output systems. Here, we present a computational model of the neocortical systems that underlie this feature detection process and its state-dependent modulation mediated by the amygdala and its downstream target the nucleus basalis of Meynert. In particular, we analyze the role of different populations of inhibitory interneurons in the regulation of cortical activity and their state-dependent gating of sensory signals. In our model, we show that the neuromodulator acetylcholine (ACh), which is in turn under control of the amygdala, plays a distinct role in the dynamics of each population and their associated gating function serving the detection of novel sensory features not captured in the state of the network, facilitating the adjustment of cortical sensory representations and regulating the switching between modes of attention and learning.",Acetylcholine; Neuromodulation; Neocortical circuits; Inhibitory network; MUSCARINIC ACETYLCHOLINE-RECEPTORS; PARVALBUMIN-POSITIVE INTERNEURONS; GABAERGIC CELL SUBTYPES; RAT FRONTAL-CORTEX; BASAL FOREBRAIN; VISUAL-CORTEX; CORTICAL ACETYLCHOLINE; NUCLEUS BASALIS; MACAQUE V1; NEURONS

During one condition, subjects were imaged while tapping in synchrony with tones separated by a constant interval (auditory synchronisation, AS), followed by tapping without the pacing stimulus (auditory continuation, AC). In another condition, subjects were imaged while tapping in synchrony with a visual stimulus presented at the same frequency as the tones (visual synchronisation,VS) followed by a tapping sequence without visual pacing (visual continuation, VC). The following main results were obtained: (1) tapping in the context of visual pacing was generally more variable than tapping in the context of auditory stimuli; (2) during all conditions, a fronto-parietal network was active including the dorsal lateral premotor cortex (dPMC), M1, S1, inferior parietal lobule (LPi), supplementary motor cortex (SMA), the right cerebellar hemisphere, and the paravermial region; (3) stronger activation in the bilateral ventral premotor cortex (vPMC), the left LPi, the SMA, the right inferior cerebellum, and the left thalamus during both auditory conditions (AS and AC) compared to the visual conditions (VS and VC); (4) stronger activation in the right superior cerebellum, the vermis, and the right LPi during the visual conditions (VS and VC); (5) similar activations for the AS and AC conditions; but (6) marked differences between the VS and VC conditions especially in the dorsal premotor cortex (dPMC) and LPi areas; and (7) finally, there were no activations in the auditory and visual cortices when the pacing stimuli were absent. These findings were taken as evidence for a general difference between the motor control modes operative during the auditory and visual conditions. Paced finger tapping in the context of auditory pacing stimuli relies more on brain structures subserving internal motor control while paced finger-tapping in the context of visual pacing stimuli relies on brain structures relying on the subserving processing or imagination of visual pacing stimuli.

Vestibular information is represented in at least three distinct regions of the cerebral cortex in cats and monkeys: the parietal and somatosensory cortex and the parietoinsular vestibular cortex. In addition, vestibular-related signals are found in more extensive regions, including the motor and premotor regions and frontal eye fields. Most of these regions also project directly to the vestibular nuclei. In monkeys, at least six cortical regions have been identified, including the motor, somatosensory, parietal and temporal areas. Most of these regions receive vestibular projections via the thalamus. Most neurons in those cortical areas respond to head velocity and receive converging vestibular, visual and somatosensory input. Electrical stimulation of some of these cortical areas in anesthetized cats influences the activity of many vestibular nuclear neurons including those projecting to the spinal cord. Lesions of the parietal vestibular regions impair the vestibule-ocular reflex (VOR) and visual suppression of the VOR as well as vestibular-related cognitive functions such as spatial perception and memory in human subjects. Diffuse cortical damage also results in similar impairment of the VOR and suppression of the VOR and possibly the vestibulo-collic reflex. Such impairments after cortical lesions may well be due in part to interruption of cortico-vestibular connections. Future studies in alert animals should focus on the role of different cortical regions projecting to the vestibular nuclei, specifically on how each affects the processing of vestibular signals that mediate vestibule-motor reflexes and that are used for vestibular related cognitive processes.",vestibular system; cerebral cortex; spatial perception; corticovestibular projection; vestibulomotor reflex; eye movement; VESTIBULO-OCULAR REFLEX; VISUAL-TRACKING NEURONS; MONKEYS MACACA-FASCICULARIS; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; MOVEMENT-RELATED ACTIVITY; FRONTAL OCULOMOTOR AREA; MEMORY-GUIDED SACCADES; CANAL-NECK INTERACTION; PURSUIT EYE-MOVEMENTS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX

In turn, the posterior parietal areas send projections to the frontal primary motor and premotor areas. This cortical pathway is hypothesized to be involved in the transformation of a visual input into the appropriate motor output. In this study we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of the entire brain to determine the patterns of activation that occurred while subjects performed a visually guided motor task. In nine human subjects, fMRI data were acquired on a 4-T whole-body MR system equipped with a head gradient coil and a birdcage RF coil using a T-2*-weighted EPI sequence. Functional activation was determined for three different tasks: (1) a visuomotor task consisting of moving a cursor on a screen with a joystick in relation to various targets, (2) a hand movement task consisting of moving the joystick without visual input, and (3) a eye movement task consisting of moving the eyes alone without visual input. Blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) contrast-based activation maps of each subject were generated using period cross-correlation statistics. Subsequently, each subject's brain was normalized to Talairach coordinates, and the individual maps were compared on a pixel by pixel basis. Significantly activated pixels common to at least four out of six subjects were retained to construct the final functional image. The pattern of activation during visually guided movements was consistent with the flow of information from striate and extrastriate visual areas, to the posterior parietal complex, and then to frontal motor areas. The extensive activation of this network and the reproducibility among subjects is consistent with a role for the dorsal stream in transforming visual information into motor behavior.

Thalamic activation, particularly of the pulvinar, suggests that this nucleus is an important subcortical target of the dorsal stream.

Seven days after administration of domoic acid (2.25 mg/kg i.p.) or vehicle, brains were collected and sectioned and stained to visualize Nissl substance using thionin, argyrophilia using a cupric silver staining method, astroglia using immunohistochemistry to detect glial fibrillary acidic protein-like immunoreactivity (GFAP-ir), and activated microglia using lectin histochemistry to detect Griffonia simplicifolia I-B-4 isolectin (GSI-B-4) binding in adjacent sections. In approximately 60% of rats to which it was administered, domoic acid caused stereotyped behavior within 60 min, followed by convulsions within 2-3 h. Brains of domoic acid-administered rats that did not manifest stereotyped behavior or convulsions did not differ from brains from vehicle-administered controls. In animals that had manifested stereotyped behavior and convulsions, Nissl staining was mostly unremarkable in brain sections. In contrast, there was intense argyrophilia in anterior olfactory nucleus, CA1 hippocampus, lateral septum, parietal (layer IV), piriform, and entorhinal cortices, ventral posterolateral thalamus, and amygdala. This pattern was reminiscent of that seen in postmortem specimens from humans who consumed domoic acid-tainted mussels and in experimental animals after kainic acid administration. Adjacent sections displayed astrogliosis, evidenced by increased GFAP-ir, which was more diffuse than the argyrophilic reaction. Activated microglia were revealed using GSI-B-4 histochemistry. These data suggest activation of discrete brain circuits in rats that convulse following domoic acid administration and subsequent pathological alterations. The data strongly suggest that neuropathology following domoic acid occurs only in animals manifesting domoic acid-induced sterotypy and convulsions. The data do not rule out more insidious damage in behaviorally normal rats that receive domoic acid.

First published June 29, 2011; doi: 10.1152/jn.00894.2010.-We have recorded single-neuron activity from cytoarchitectonic area 18 of anesthetized (0.4-0.7% isoflurane in 65% N2O-35% O-2 gaseous mixture) domestic cats. Neurons were identified as simple or complex on the basis of the ratios between the phase-variant (F1) component and the mean firing rate (F0) of spike responses to optimized (orientation, direction, spatial and temporal frequencies, size) high-contrast, luminance-modulated, sine-wave drifting gratings (simple: F1/F0 spike-response ratios > 1; complex: F1/F0 spike-response ratios < 1). The predominance (similar to 80%) of simple cells among the neurons recorded from the principal thalamorecipient layers supports the idea that most simple cells in area 18 might constitute a putative early stage in the visual information processing. Apart from the spike-generating regions (the classical receptive fields, CRFs), the receptive fields of three-quarters of area 18 neurons contain silent, extraclassical suppressive regions (ECRFs). The spatial extent of summation areas of excitatory responses was negatively correlated with the strength of the ECRF-induced suppression of spike responses. Lowering the stimulus contrast resulted in an expansion of the summation areas of excitatory responses accompanied by a reduction in the strength of the ECRF-induced suppression. The spatial and temporal frequency and orientation tunings of the ECRFs were much broader than those of the CRFs. Hence, the ECRFs of area 18 neurons appear to be largely inherited from their dorsal thalamic inputs. In most area 18 cells, costimulation of CRFs and ECRFs resulted in significant increases in F1/F0 spike-response ratios, and thus there was a contextually modulated functional continuum between the simple and complex cells.",luminance-modulated gratings; simple and complex cells; spatial and temporal properties; classical and extraclassical receptive fields; primary visual cortex; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; CONTEXTUAL RESPONSE MODULATION; TEMPORAL-FREQUENCY-SELECTIVITY; OPTIC-NERVE FIBERS; SPATIAL-FREQUENCY; STRIATE CORTEX; MACAQUE V1; SURROUND SUPPRESSION; COMPLEX CELLS

Firstly it has a strictly defined genetically determined substrate of specific neurons classes, specific rules for which kinds of cells interconnect, a laminar architecture where efferent and afferent relays and interlaminar links are predetermined. But, as well, a second strategy allows great developmental lability in the precise spatial patterns of intralaminar circuits of the excitatory neurons and in the actual weights of excitatory and inhibitory synapses that are contributed to each neuron. This second strategy presumably allows the cortex to be tailor-made to the early experience of each individual and, as well, allow for lability of responses to different conditions of stimulation and adjustment of the system to compensate to some degree for injuries affecting afferents and circuitry in the adult system.",nan; MONKEY STRIATE CORTEX; LOCAL CIRCUIT NEURONS; SPINY STELLATE NEURONS; THALAMIC RECIPIENT NEURONS; MACAQUE MONKEY; POSTNATAL-DEVELOPMENT; AREA 17; CORTICOTHALAMIC CELLS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MACACA-NEMESTRINA

To examine object-centred information processing, we measured regional cerebral blood flow in 11 normal subjects with PET. During each PET scan, a subject viewed a sample stimulus followed by a cue on a video screen, The sample consisted of two polygons, termed 'objects', each located in a corner of the screen. A small target spot appeared in a corner of each polygon, There were two tasks: the visuomotor task and the matching-to-sample task, In the visuomotor task, the subject moved a joystick in a direction indicated by either the location of the target spot inside the object (if object-centred coordinates were operative) or the location of the object relative to the video screen (if screen-centred coordinates were operative;), In the matching-to-sample task, the subject moved the joystick to report whether the relevant spatial information (object- or screen-centred) in the cue matched the sample. In both the visuomotor and the matching-to-sample task, use of object-centred (versus screen- or viewer-centred) information caused augmented activation in the inferior occipitotemporal cortex, bilaterally, in the left superior occipital gyrus, and in both the thalamus and the brainstem, In addition, in the visuomotor task such activation occurred in the right posterior parietal cortex and in the left ventral premotor, dorsolateral prefrontal and anterior supplementary motor areas. These findings suggest the involvement of the occipitotemporal cortex and a broad frontoparietal network when, as in the visuomotor task, object-centred information guides movement, When the same data underlie declarative reports, as in the matching-to-sample task, thp occipitotemporal cortex remains engaged but frontoparietal network diminishes in importance.",cerebral blood flow; object-centred coordinate; screen-centred coordinate; occipitotemporal cortex; frontoparietal network; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; LATERAL INTRAPARIETAL AREA; HUMAN EXTRASTRIATE CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL-ANATOMY; VISUAL PATHWAYS; MACAQUE MONKEYS; GRASP REPRESENTATIONS; PRIMATE PREMOTOR; FRONTAL-CORTEX

We immunohistochemically investigated Fos protein expression in the brain of rats exposed to gravito-inertial force changes. Experiments were performed in hypergravity rats born and housed for 60 days in terrestrian gravity (1 x g) and thereafter exposed for 90 min to 2 x g or 4 x g in a centrifuge, and in hypogravity rats born and housed for 60 days at 2 x g and submitted for 90 min to 1 x g. Data from these two experimental groups were quantified by light microscopy and compared to those from two groups of control rats born and permanently housed in either 1 x g or 2 x g environments that never had to adapt to novel gravito-inertial environments. Results showed a low basal Fos expression in the controls and a strong Fos staining in the experimental rats. Only the hypergravity rats displayed Fos-positive cells in vestibular-related brainstem regions (medial, inferior, and superior vestibular nuclei (VN); group y; dorsomedial cell column (DMCC) of the inferior olive (IO)). By contrast, many suprabulbar areas were strongly labeled in both the hyper- and hypogravity rats, as shown by the numerous Fos-positive cells in mesencephalic (colliculus, laterodorsal periaqueductal gray, autonomic nuclei), diencephalic (hypothalamic and thalamic nuclei), and telencephalic (parietal, temporal, entorhinal and visual cortices) structures. These spatial patterns of Fos expression suggest that an increase in gravito-inertial force activates otolith-vestibulo-olivar pathways and various suprabulbar structures underlying the corticovestibular interactions, which govern the multiple representations of vestibular information in the cortex. A decrease in gravito-inertial force has the opposite effects on the vestibulo-olivar structures as a result of otolith system disfacilitation which, in turn, modifies the activity of complex neural pathways. Exposure to both hyper- and hypogravity environments likely induces neurovegetative and/or stress effects that could account for Fos labeling in autonomic nuclei and in nervous structures involved in the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis.

ANESTHETIZED AND PARALYZED ANIMALS,"Extending previous investigations of the topographic relationship between ocular dominance and orientation columns in the cat visual cortex the two systems were visualized with transneuronally transported [H-3]proline and with activity-dependent uptake of [C-14]2-deoxyglucose, respectively. In addition, we used the 2-deoxyglucose method for a functional assay of both columnar systems. To this end, cats were injected with [H-3]proline in the right eye. Two weeks later, they were stimulated monocularly through this eye by presenting contours of only a single orientation in the left and contours of many different orientations in the right visual hemifield while 2-deoxyglucose was injected. The patterns of increased 2-deoxyglucose uptake and of terminal labelling were analysed in flat-mount sections of the visual cortices and in frontal sections of the lateral geniculate nuclei. In the lateral geniculate nucleus, regions of increased 2-deoxyglucose uptake are in register with the [H-3]proline-labelled laminae of the open eye. In the visual cortex, the hemispheres stimulated with many different orientations showed a rather homogeneous accumulation of 2-deoxyglucose over the entire extent and throughout all layers of area 17. The hemispheres stimulated with a single orientation displayed columnar patterns of orientation domains essentially similar to those obtained with binocular presentation of a single orientation. In particular and despite monocular stimulation, regions of increased 2-deoxyglucose uptake were neither in register with the [H-3]proline-labelled terminals of the stimulated eye in layer IV nor confined to columns of neural tissue above and below these terminals. The maximal horizontal offset between the termination sites of thalamic afferents and activated orientation columns was in the order of 400 mum. These findings suggest several conclusions. (i) In the cat visual cortex, binocular convergence seems to occur so early in cortical processing that monocular stimulation with many orientations leads to a rather homogeneous activation of cortical tissue. (ii) From the termination zones of geniculate afferents activity is apparently distributed already within layer IV to the respective orientation columns. (iii) This horizontal spread of activity could be assured by target cells with radially extending dendrites and/or tangentially oriented fibres.",AREA-17; OCULAR DOMINANCE COLUMNS; ORIENTATION COLUMNS; MAPS; [H-3]PROLINE; OCULAR DOMINANCE COLUMNS; ORIENTATION COLUMNS; STRIATE CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; TOPOGRAPHIC ORGANIZATION; INTRINSIC CONNECTIONS; CORTICAL AREAS; FLAT-MOUNTS; SYSTEM; DEOXYGLUCOSE

Immunohistochemistry was used to assess cytoarchitecture with neuron-specific nuclear binding protein (NeuN) and neurocytology with intermediate neurofilament proteins, parvalbumin and glutamic acid decarboxylase. Key findings include: (1) Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) area 32 has dorsal and ventral divisions. (2) Area 33 is part of ACC. (3) Midcingulate cortex (MCC) has anterior and posterior divisions and this was verified with extensive quantitative analysis and a horizontal series of sections. (4) NeuN, also known as Fox-3, is not limited to somata and formed nodules, granular clusters and striations in the apical dendrites of pyramidal neurons. (5) Area 30 forms a complex of anterior and posterior parts with further medial and lateral divisions. (6) Area 29b has two divisions and occupies substantially more volume than in rat. (7) Area 29a begins with a subsplenial component and extends relatively further caudal than in rat. As similar areal designations are often used among species, direct comparisons were made of rabbit areas with those in rat and monkey. The dichotomy of MCC is of particular interest to studies of pain as anterior MCC is most frequently activated in human acute pain studies and the rabbit can be used to study this subregion. Finally, the area 30 complex is not primarily dysgranular as in rat and is more differentiated than in any other mammal including human.

Here we examined histological sections stained for myelin, Nissl substance, and cytochrome oxidase, allowing identification of likely homologues of most of the architectural fields defined in Old World monkeys. Ventrally, we identified three granular fields at or near the frontal pole (area 10, and the medial and lateral subregions of area 11), and two granular fields along the lateral margin of the orbitofrontal cortex (medial and orbital subdivisions of area 12). More caudal and medially, dysgranular and agranular cortices included four subdivisions of area 13 as well as rostral and caudal subdivisions of area 14 (at the ventrome-dial convexity). The ventral frontotemporal transition encompassed at least two subdivisions of agranular insular cortex, as well as the likely homologues of the gustatory cortices. Most of the medial surface was encompassed by area 10 (which projected a caudomedial finger-like extension toward the subgenual cortex), together with a relatively large dysgranular area 32 and an agranular area 25 (in subgenual cortex). Finally, the caudal limit of the medial frontal cortex included two fields of agranular cingulate cortex (areas 24a and 24b). These findings enhance our understanding of the architectural organization of the marmoset frontal cortex and highlight a highly conserved basic organization across simian primates, allowing the informed interpretation of experimental neurological studies.

Electrical stimulation (500 ms trains) delivered to microelectrode sites evoked movements of reach, defense, and grasp, from distinct zones in M1/PM and PPC, in squirrel and owl monkeys. Tracer injections into M1/PM reach, defense, and grasp zones showed dense connections with M1/PM hand/forelimb representations. The densest inputs outside of frontal cortex were from PPC zones. M1 zones were additionally connected with somatosensory hand/forelimb representations in areas 3a, 3b, and 1 and the somatosensory areas of the upper bank of the lateral sulcus (S2/PV). Injections into PPC zones showed primarily local connections and the densest inputs outside of PPC originated from M1/PM zones. The PPC reach zone also received dense inputs from cortex caudal to PPC, which likely relayed visual information. In contrast, the PPC grasp zone was densely connected with the hand/forelimb representations of areas 3a, 3b, 1, and S2/PV. Thus, the dorsal parietal-frontal network involved in reaching was preferentially connected to visual cortex, whereas the more ventral network involved in grasping received somatosensory inputs.

Along the rostrocaudal axis of the postcentral gyrus, we found a gradual and continuous increase in the number of neurons with converging receptive fields and those in which receptive field positions or submodalities were not determined. Deep or skin submodality neurons were dominant in area 3a or 3b respectively. The proportion of skin submodality neurons decreased gradually from area 3b to the more caudal part of the gyrus. The proportion of deep submodality neurons was almost constant from area 3b to area 2 inclusive; they were not the majority in area 2.

Recent physiological data revealed that the disparity selective V2 cells increase their responses when (random-dot stereograms) stimuli within their receptive fields are at or near the boundary of a depth surface. Such highlights to depth (non-luminance) edges are seemingly not computationally required for the correspondence problem. Computationally, these highlights make the boundaries of a depth surface more salient, serving pre-attentive segmentation (between depth planes) and attracting visual attention. In special cases, they enable the psychophysically observed perceptual pop-out of a target from a background of visually identical distractors at a different depth. To achieve the highlights, mutual inhibition between disparity selective cells that are tuned to the same or similar depths is required. However, such mutual inhibition would impede the computation for the correspondence problem, which requires mutual excitation between the same cells. In this work, I introduce a computational model that, I believe, is the first to address both stereo correspondence and pre-attentive stereo segmentation. The computational mechanisms in the model are based on intracortical interactions in V2. I will demonstrate that the model captures the following physiological and psychophysical phenomena: (i) depth-edge highlighting; (ii) disparity capture; (iii) pop-out; and (iv) transparency.",stereo pop-out; stereo correspondence; modelling; contextual influences; V2; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; CONTEXTUAL INFLUENCES; BINOCULAR DEPTH; DISPARITY; CONNECTIONS; VISION; V1; COMPUTATION; ALGORITHM; MACAQUE

It is found that the apical dendrites of medium-sized and large pyramidal cells in layer V group together to form clusters that have a center-to-center spacing of about 56 mum. As these clusters ascend, the apical dendrites of pyramidal cells in layer II/III are added to them. The thinner apical dendrites of the smaller pyramidal cells in layer VIa also form groups that are referred to as bundles. These bundles ascend, into layer IV independent of the clusters, and their arrangement suggests that the bundles are formed so that the apical dendrites of the layer VIa pyramids can pass between the groups of cell bodies of the layer V neurons. It is proposed that the clusters formed from the apical dendrites of the layer V and layer II/III pyramidal cells represent the axes of vertical modules of pyramidal cells, which represent the basic neuronal aggregates within area 17 of cat visual cortex. And it is suggested that these modules can be recruited in various combinations, most obviously by the excitation provided by the thalamic inputs, to form the functional columns, such as the ones that are concerned with eye preference and orientation. Based upon the distribution of the dendritic clusters, the pyramidal cell modules would have diameters of 56 mum, and since they are considered to extend through the depth of the cortex, each one would contain some 203 neurons. The striate cortex of one hemisphere contains 160,000 of these modules, which is about the same as the number of X-cells projecting to one hemisphere from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus and twice the number of X- or beta-ganglion cells in the retina. The form of the pyramidal cell modules in cat striate cortex is compared to those present in monkey striate cortex, in which the similar modules are about 10 times more numerous, but only 31 mum in diameter (Peters and Sethares, 1991a).",nan; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; MICROTUBULE-ASSOCIATED PROTEIN-2; RECEPTIVE-FIELD PROPERTIES; OCULAR-DOMINANCE COLUMNS; MACAQUE STRIATE CORTEX; PYRAMIDAL NEURONS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; ORIENTATION COLUMNS; FUNCTIONAL-ANATOMY; APICAL DENDRITES

Other goals of this investigation are to identify other pretectal nuclear projections from the visual cortex in the guinea pig, and to determine whether there is any visuotopic organization in this pathway. Axonal tracers (biocytin or H-3-leucine) were injected into the striate cortex (Oc 1), and the tissue processed with histochemical or light autoradiographic techniques. All subcortical terminal labeling is ipsilateral in the basal ganglia and thalamic nuclei. Furthermore, projections are traced to the ipsilateral brainstem, including two areas of the pretectal complex: (1) one in the NOT, extending in some cases to the adjacent lateral portion of the posterior pretectal nucleus (PPN), and (2) one in the pars compacta of the anterior pretectal nucleus (APNc). The terminal fields in the APN are consistently located rostrally in the dorsolateral portion of the nucleus, independently of the injection site in Oc 1, whereas in the NOT the terminal fields shift slightly after injections placed in different locations in the striate cortex. A correlation of the injection sites in Oc 1 and terminal fields in the NOT reveals a loose topographic organization in the cortico-NOT projection; accordingly, the rostrocaudal axis of the striate cortex projects to the lateromedial axis of the NOT, with a 90 degrees rotation, whereas lateral parts of the striate cortex project diffusely throughout the rostrocaudal extent of the NOT. These data show for the first time that the NOT in the guinea pig receives a substantial projection from the visual cortex. Given the fact that in the guinea pig the optokinetic nystagmus shares some of the characteristics found in cat and monkey (i.e., consistent initial fast rise in the slow phase velocity and reduced asymmetry in monocular stimulation), the present findings lend support to the hypothesis that a cortical input to the NOT is a necessary condition for these oculomotor properties to be present.

The force co-ordination pattern was investigated by means of a specially designed object that monitored the isometric fingertip forces applied to the contact surfaces during precision grip, Hand function was measured by means of neurological examination, functional hand-grips and dexterity, Brain lesions were identified by series of ultrasound and MRI scans. Normally, the fingertip forces are applied to the object in the initial phase of the lift in an invariant force co-ordination pattern (i.e. grip-lift synergy), in which the grip and load forces are initiated simultaneously and increase in parallel with unimodal force rate trajectories. A majority of children with unilateral brain lesions had not developed the force co-ordination pattern typical for their age, but produced an immature or a pathological pattern. The developmental level of the grip-lift synergy was determined and quantified according to criteria derived from earlier studies on normally developed children, There was a clear relationship between the developmental level of the grip-lift synergy and impaired dexterity, indicating that proper development of the force co-ordination pattern is important for skilled hand function, The grip-lift synergy correlated with the total extent of lesions in the contralateral cortex and white matter and with lesions in the thalamus/basal ganglia, while no correlation was found for isolated cortical lesions. The results suggest that the neural circuits involved in the control of the precision grip are organized in a parallel and distributed system in the hemispheres, and that the basal ganglia are important during the formation of these circuits. Perinatal lesions in specific cortical motor areas may be compensated for by circuits elsewhere in the grip-lift motor system, while large lesions exclude this possibility.",unilateral brain lesion; grip; dexterity; children; cerebral palsy; SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA; HUMAN PRECISION GRIP; POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; CENTRAL CONDUCTION DELAYS; CEREBRAL-PALSY; CORTICOSPINAL PROJECTIONS; ANTICIPATORY CONTROL; MANIPULATIVE FORCES; ISOMETRIC FORCES; MACAQUE MONKEY

However, direct investigation of the influence of brain circuitry on function has been hindered by the lack of a technique for exploring anatomical connectivity in the in vivo brain. Recent advances in magnetic resonance diffusion imaging have given scientists access to data relating to local white matter architecture and, for the first time, have raised the possibility of in vivo investigations into brain circuitry. This review investigates whether diffusion imaging may be used to identify regions of grey matter that are distinct in their connectional architecture, and whether these connectional differences are reflected either in local cytoarchitecture or in local grey matter function. Establishing a direct relationship between regional boundaries based on diffusion imaging and borders between regions that perform different functions would not only be of great significance when interpreting functional results, but would also provide a first step towards the validation of diffusion-based anatomical connectivity studies.",grey matter parcellation; diffusion MRI; tractography; structure/function; MEDIAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; HUMAN THALAMUS; HUMAN BRAIN; AXONAL PROJECTIONS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; CINGULATE CORTEX; CORTICAL FIELDS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; RHESUS-MONKEY

TS activated two sources sequentially within SI: one in the posterior bank of the central sulcus and another in the crown of the postcentral gyrus, corresponding to Brodmann's areas 3b and 1, respectively. Activities from area 3b consisted of 20- and 30-ms responses. Activities from area 1 consisted of three components peaking at 26, 36 and 49 ms. ES activated one source within SI whose location and orientation were similar to those of the TS-activated area 1 source. Activities from this source consisted of three components peaking at 88, 98 and 109 ms, later by 60 ms than the corresponding TS responses. ES and TS subsequently activated a similar region in the upper bank of the sylvian fissure, corresponding to the secondary somatosensory cortex (SII). The onset latency of the SII activity following ES (109 ms) was later by 29 ms than that of the first SI response (80 ms). Likewise, the onset latency of SII activity following TS (52 ms) was later by 35 ms than that of area 1 of SI (17 ms). Therefore, our results showed that the processing of noxious and innocuous stimuli is similar with respect to the source locations and activation timings within SI and SII except that there were no detectable activations within area 3b following noxious stimulation.",epidermal stimulation; magnetoencephalography; secondary somatosensory cortex; serial processing; SOMATIC SENSORY CORTEX; MEDIAN NERVE; MACACA-FASCICULARIS; RESPONSE PROPERTIES; THALAMIC AFFERENTS; EVOKED-POTENTIALS; LATENCY ACTIVITY; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; RHESUS-MONKEY; MOTOR CORTEX

While it is known that accompanying visual and somatosensory signals can benefit auditory perception, often by making the sound seem louder, the specific neural bases for sensory amplification are still debated. In this review, we want to deal with what we regard as confusion on two topics that are crucial to our understanding of multisensory integration mechanisms in auditory cortex: (1) Anatomical Underpinnings (e.g., what circuits underlie multisensory convergence), and (2) Temporal Dynamics (e.g., what time windows of integration are physiologically feasible). The combined evidence on multisensory structure and function in auditory cortex advances the emerging view of the relationship between perception and low level multisensory integration. In fact, it seems that the question is no longer whether low level, putatively unisensory cortex is accessible to multisensory influences, but how.

Results are reported at postnatal day 3 (P3), P15, P30, and from adult animals. The AI core could be distinguished from the DC belt on the basis of its strict tonotopic organization, evident in all chinchillas studied (including the youngest). Averaged by age group and compared to their core counterparts, belt neurons generally had similar absolute (spike rate) thresholds and onset latencies (at a given sound pressure level), but lower maximum spike rates, broader tuning bandwidths, and more complex (multipeaked) receptive fields. Most notably, the fraction of complex belt units in the near-newborn (P3) group was high (similar to 50%), and did not systematically increase with age, while that of complex core units was similar to 10% at P3 and increased steadily to about 40% in adulthood. These results provide further evidence to support the hypothesis that, at least to some extent, core and belt auditory cortex may constitute parallel processing streams which represent different aspects of complex acoustic stimuli.",electrophysiology; extracellular recording; auditory system; tonotopic map; spatial tuning; development; RHESUS-MONKEY; GUINEA-PIG; CAT; AREAS; ORGANIZATION; PARALLEL; SUBDIVISIONS; MULTIPLE; THALAMUS; STREAMS

Studies of visual onset latencies generally suggest that parallel processing occurs throughout the dorsal stream. These studies are at odds with the proposed hierarchies of visual areas based on termination patterns of cortico-cortical projections. In previous studies, a variety of stimuli have been used to compute latencies, and this is problematic as latencies are known to depend on stimulus parameters. This could explain the discrepancy between latency and neuroanatomical based studies. Therefore, the first aim of the present study was to determine whether latencies increased along the hierarchy of visual areas when the same stimuli are used. In addition, the effect of stimulus complexity was assessed. Visual onset latencies were calculated for area 17, PMLS, AMLS, and AEV neurons. Latencies were also computed from neurons in the lateral posterior (LP)-pulvinar complex given the importance of this extrageniculate complex in cortical intercommunication. Latency distributions from all regions overlapped substantially, and no significant difference was present, regardless of the type of stimulus used. The onset latencies in the LP-pulvinar complex were comparable to those seen in cortical areas. The data suggest that the initial processing of information in the visual system is parallel, despite the presence of a neuroanatomical hierarchy. Simultaneous response onsets among cortical areas and the LP-pulvinar suggest that the latter is more than a simple relay station for information headed to cortex. The data are consistent with proposals of the LP-pulvinar as a center for the integration and distribution of information from/to multiple cortical areas.",nan; LATERAL POSTERIOR NUCLEUS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; CONNECTIONAL ORGANIZATION; TEMPORAL INTEGRATION; MOTION INTEGRATION; LAMINAR ORIGINS; THALAMIC NUCLEI; MACAQUE MONKEY; RHESUS-MONKEY; AREAS V1

Within this scheme, output compartments of V1, such as the cytochrome oxidase(CO) rich blobs in cortical layer III, synthesize new output pathways appropriate for the next steps in visual analysis. Our chief aim in this study was to examine and compare the synaptic arrangements and neurochemistry of elements involving direct lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) input from the K pathway with those involving indirect LGN input from the M and P pathways arriving from cortical layer IV. Geniculocortical K axons were labeled via iontophoretic injections of wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase into the LGN and intracortical layer IV axons (indirect P and M pathways to the CO-blobs) were labeled by iontophoretic injections of Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin into layer IV. The neurochemical content of both pre-and postsynaptic profiles was identified by postembedding immunocytochemistry for gamma-amino butyric acid (GABA) and glutamate. Sizes of pre- and postsynaptic elements were quantified by using an image analysis system, BioQuant IV. Our chief finding is that K LGN axons and layer IV axons (indirect input from M and P pathways) exhibit different synaptic relationships to CO blob cells. Specifically, our results show that within the CO blobs: 1) all K cell axons contain glutamate, and the vast majority of layer IV axons contain glutamate with only 5% containing GABA; 2) K axons terminate mainly on dendritic spines of glutamatergic cells, while layer IV axons terminate mainly on dendritic shafts of glutamatergic cells; 3) K axons have larger boutons and contact larger postsynaptic dendrites, which suggests that they synapse closer to the cell body within the CO blobs than do layer IV axons. Taken together, these results suggest that each input pathway to the CO blobs uses a different strategy to contribute to the processing of visual information within these compartments.

Since the contribution of the AGG to pain processing is poorly understood, this study employed PET and magnetic resonance (MR) image co-registration in grouped and individual cases to locate regions of altered relative regional cerebral blood flow (rGBF). Seven right-handed, neurologically intact males were subjects; each received neuropsychological and pain threshold testing. Subjects were scanned during infusion of H-2[O-15]: four randomized scans during innocuous heat stimulation to the back of the left hand and four scans during noxious but bearable heat to the same place. The averaged rGBF values during innocuous stimuli were subtracted from those during noxious stimuli and statistical parametric maps (SPMs) for the group were computed to identify regions of altered relative rGBF. Finally, single-subject PET images of elevated and reduced rCBF were co-registered with MR images and projected onto reconstructions of the medial surface of the hemisphere. The SPM analysis of the group showed one site with elevated rCBF in the midcingulate cortex and one in the perigenual cortex predominantly contralateral to the side of stimulation. There were bilateral sites of reduced rGBF in the cingulofrontal transitional cortex and in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCG). Co-registered PET and MR images for individuals showed that only one case had a single, large region of elevated rCBF, while the others had a number of smaller regions. Six cases had at least one significant elevation of rGBF in the right hemisphere that primarily involved area 24b'; five of these cases also had an elevation in area 32', while the seventh case had elevated rGBF in these areas in the left hemisphere. The rostral site of elevated rCBF in the group was at the border of areas 24/24' and areas 32/32', although most cases had a site of elevation more rostral in the perigenual cingulate cortex. The AGG site of reduced rGBF was in areas 8 and 32 and that in the PCG included much of areas 29/30 in the callosal sulcus, areas 23b and 31 on the cingulate gyral surface and parietal area 7m. The localization of relative rGBF changes suggests different roles for the cingulate cortex in pain processing: (i) elevated rGBF in area 24' may be involved in response selection like nocifensive reflex inhibition; (ii) activation of the perigenual cortex may participate in affective responses to noxious stimuli like suffering associated with pain; and (iii) reduced rCBF in areas 8 and 32 may enhance pain perception in the perigenual cortex, while that in the PGC may disengage visually guided processes.",nociception; cerebral blood flow; limbic cortex; affect; response selection; POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; RHESUS-MONKEY; HUMAN-BRAIN; FUNCTIONAL-ANATOMY; MULTIPLE REPRESENTATIONS; AUTOMATED ALGORITHM; CORTICAL AFFERENTS; MEDIAL THALAMUS; MACAQUE MONKEY; MESIAL AREA-6

This study employed multiple-electrode arrays with relatively high spatial resolution (0.1 or 0.2 mm spacing) to record laminar profiles of somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs), multiple unit activity (MUA) and current source-densities (CSDs) at several sites across the postcentral gyri of two awake monkeys. This high resolution laminar analysis strongly supports our earlier hypothesis based upon low resolution data that N1 is generated by synaptic excitation targeted specifically at the most superficial cortical layers I/II: (1) The excitatory nature of N1 was indicated by elevated MUA which was maximal in layer III and extended down to subcortical white matter where fiber activity exceeded prestimulus levels; (2) In addition to CSD analysis, the observation that N1 was maximally negative within 0.10 mm of the border between layers I and II verified the superficial site of N1 synaptic excitation regardless of conductivity boundaries near the pial surface. A review of the anatomical literature finds that the most likely inputs responsible for N1 activation are the backward cortico-cortical projections from secondary somatosensory areas to SI which in area 1 are the major source of sensory-related input that specifically terminates in layers I/II. We suggest, therefore, that backward projections are involved in the conscious process of touch sensation as it is signaled by N1.",SENSATION; MULTIPLE ELECTRODE ARRAYS; SOMATOSENSORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; MULTIPLE UNIT ACTIVITY; CURRENT SOURCE-DENSITY; LAMINAR ANALYSIS; CORTICAL CONNECTIVITY; AWAKE MONKEYS; RHESUS-MONKEY; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; STRIATE CORTEX; CAT; PARIETAL; CONNECTIONS; CELLS; RESPONSES; THALAMUS; REGIONS

Music acts as a specific stimulus to obtain motor and emotional responses by combining movement and stimulation of different sensory pathways. We explored the efficacy of active music therapy (MT) on motor and emotional functions in patients with PD. Methods: This prospective, randomized, controlled, single-blinded study lasted 3 months. It consisted of weekly sessions of MT and physical therapy (PT). Thirty-two patients with PD, all stable responders to levodopa and in Hoehn and Yahr stage 2 or 3, were randomly assigned to two groups of 16 patients each. We assessed severity of PD with the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale, emotional functions with the Happiness Measure, and quality of life using the Parkinson's Disease Quality of Life questionnaire. MT sessions consisted of choral singing, voice exercise, rhythmic and free body movements, and active music involving collective invention. PT sessions included a series of passive stretching exercises, specific motor tasks, and strategies to improve balance and gait. Results: MT had a significant overall effect on bradykinesia as measured by the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (p < .034). Post-MT session findings were consistent with motor improvement, especially in bradykinesia items (p < .0001). Overtime, changes on the Happiness Measure confirmed a beneficial effect of MT on emotional functions (p < .0001). Improvements in activities of daily living and in quality of life were also documented in the MT group (p < .0001). PT improved rigidity (p <.0001). Conclusions: MT is effective on motor, affective, and behavioral functions.

The task was a complicated right-hand finger movement sequence. The subjects were examined at three stages: during initial practice of the finger movement sequence, in an advanced stage of learning, and after they had learnt the finger movement sequence. Quantitative evaluation of video tapes and electromyographic records of the right forearm and hand muscles demonstrated that the finger movements significantly accelerated and became more regular. Significant mean RCBF increases were induced in the left motor hand area, the left premotor cortex, the left supplementary motor area, the left sensory hand area, the left supplementary sensory area and the right anterior lobe of the cerebellum. During the learning process significant depressions of the mean RCBF occurred bilaterally in the superior parietal lobule, the anterior parietal cortex and the pars triangularis of the right inferior frontal cortex. The mean RCBF increases in these structures during the initial stage of learning were related to somatosensory feedback processing and internal language for the guidance of the finger movements. These activations disappeared when the subjects had learnt the finger movement sequence. Conversely, the mean RCBF significantly rose during the course of learning in the midsector of the putamen and globus pallidus on the left side.

It receives extensive sensory input and sends output to areas important for emotional processing and expression, including medial temporal cortical areas, hypothalamic and brain stem autonomic areas, and the amygdala. In the rat, the functional relationship between the orbitofrontal cortex and amygdala has been investigated in numerous recent studies. Clearer understanding of the complex connections between the rat orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala is fundamental to elucidating the functional contributions of these pathways. Recent work shows that, as in the primate, the subdivisions of the rat orbitofrontal cortex issue different patterns of projections to the amygdala, with intriguing variations in the relative distribution of projections to the sensory-related basal areas compared with output areas, such as the central nucleus. Notably, as has been observed in the monkey, the rat orbitofrontal cortex targets the intercalated nuclei, which contain GABAergic interneurons and provide local inhibitory influences within the amygdala. The complex connections between the orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala, as well as other areas involved in emotion, suggest important implications for the role of the orbitofrontal cortex in anxiety disorders, in which emotional expression is not appropriate to the situation.",amygdala; autonomic; inhibitory influence; intercalated nuclei; hypothalamus; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MEDIODORSAL THALAMIC NUCLEUS; ENDURING MEMORY IMPAIRMENT; RHESUS-MONKEY; CORTICAL PROJECTIONS; BASOLATERAL AMYGDALA; MACAQUE MONKEY; TOPOGRAPHIC ORGANIZATION; GABAERGIC PROJECTION; INSULAR CORTICES

The purpose of this study is to further examine the influence of tactile cues on real and apparent sensations of self-rotation and corresponding vestibular nystagmus during passive yaw rotation. Method: There were 15 healthy subjects (12 men and 3 women, 31 to 49 yr) who were subjected to clockwise yaw rotation at a constant velocity of 120 degrees center dot s(-1). A tactile vest using electromechanical tactors (8 columns x 3 rows) was activated either in the clockwise or counterclockwise direction in a randomized design. The sequential activation of the tactors around the body matched the velocity of chair rotation. Eye movements were monitored using infrared eye tracking. Since it is difficult to control for mental set (alertness and imagined target distance) during eye tracking, in addition to paying attention to the apparent sensation of self-motion, the sensation of rotation and the induced vestibular nystagmus were investigated separately. Results. ANOVA failed to reveal any significant effect. Our results suggested that tactile cueing did not enhance or suppress the subjective sensation of rotation during actual rotation, nor did it enhance or suppress the false sensation of rotation experienced. Also, tactile cueing had no effect on the gain and time constant of the induced per-rotation and post-rotation nystagmus with repeated exposures. Conclusion: It appears that tactile cueing delivered by a tactile garment provides a sense of direction, but it does not affect any concomitant vestibular responses.",vestibular; tactile; somatogyral illusion; nystagmus; COMPENSATORY EYE-MOVEMENTS; RHESUS-MONKEY; ROTATORY TESTS; CORTEX; CONVERGENCE; ORIENTATION; PLASTICITY; PERCEPTION; PROJECTION; THALAMUS

The functions of OFC neurons within this domain have been studied extensively in both rats and primates. Electrophysiological recordings during performance of relevant behavioral tasks provide a coherent portrait of OFC encoding that is reward related. OFC neurons represent associative relationships between events, encoding information that is predictive of outcome value. That encoding can be understood as a neural basis for deficits seen after OFC damage in the use of outcome expectancy to guide performance. There is less agreement, however, on whether OFC itself plays a role in translating information on outcome expectancy into the actual guidance of overt behavioral responding. New findings indicate that rat OFC neurons prominently encode additional task-related information and events related to goal-directed action. This encoding can occur in populations of OFC neurons that are independent of the OFC neurons representing reward value. The significance of this emerging evidence may require studies that address the larger scale network through which OFC integrates expected outcome information with behavioral control.",orbitofrontal cortex; behavioral response; reward; MEDIAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; MEDIODORSAL THALAMIC NUCLEUS; HIPPOCAMPAL PLACE CELLS; BASOLATERAL AMYGDALA; FRONTAL-CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; MACAQUE MONKEYS; RECOGNITION MEMORY

The purpose of this study is to define the cortical regions that subserve voluntary saccadic eye movements and spatial working memory in humans. 2. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) during performance of oculomotor tasks was measured with [O-15]-H2O positron emission tomography (PET). Eleven well-trained, healthy young adults performed the following tasks: visual fixation, visually guided saccades, antisaccades (a task in which subjects made saccades away from rather than toward peripheral targets), and either an oculomotor delayed response (ODR, a task requiring memory-guided saccades after a delay period) or a conditional antisaccade task (a task in which the color of the peripheral target determined whether a saccade toward or away from the target was required). An additional six subjects performed a sequential hand movement task to compare localization of hand-related motor cortex and the frontal eye fields (FEFs) and of the hand- and eye-movement-related regions of the supplementary motor area (SMA). 3. Friston's statistical parametric mapping (SPM) method was used to identify significant changes in rCBF associated with task performance. Because SPM does not take advantage of the anatomic information available in magnetic resonance (MR) scans, each subject's PET scan was registered to that individual's MR scan, after which all PET and MR studies were transformed to conform to a standard reference MR image set. Subtraction images were visually inspected while overlayed on the reference MR scan to which PET images had been aligned, in order to confirm anatomic localization of significant rCBF changes. 4. Compared with visual fixation, performing visually guided saccades led to a significant bilateral activation in FEF, cerebellum, striate cortex, and posterior temporal cortex. Right posterior thalamus activation was also observed. 5. The visually guided saccade task served as the comparison task for the ODR, antisaccade, and conditional antisaccade tasks for identification of task-related changes in rCBF beyond those associated with saccade execution. Performance on the ODR task was associated with a bilateral increase of rCBF in FEFs, SMA, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and posterior parietal cortex. The cortical regions of increased regional blood flow during the ODR task also showed increased rCBF during the antisaccade task; however, FEF and SMA activations were significant only in the right hemisphere. These findings closely parallel those of single-cell recording studies with behaving monkeys in indicating that FEF, DLPFC, SMA, and posterior parietal cortex perform computational activity for voluntary purposive saccades. 6. Comparison of PET scans obtained during performance of eye movement and hand movement tasks indicated that peak activations in FEF were located similar to 2 cm lateral and 1 cm anterior to those of hand-related motor cortex. The oculomotor area of SMA, the supplementary eye field (SEF), was located similar to 7-8 mm anterior and superior to the hand-related area of SMA. 7. During performance of antisaccade and ODR tasks, rCBF was significantly lower in ventromedial prefrontal cortex (PFC), along the rectus gyrus, and in ventral anterior cingulate cortex than during the visually guided saccade and fixation tasks. During the antisaccade task, the ventral region of lower rCBF involved medial structures including left ventral striatum and bilateral medial temporal-limbic cortex. During the ODR task, the ventral aspect of the region of lower rCBF extended laterally, rather than medially, to include the temporal poles. The lower blood flow observed in ventromedial PFC during both the antisaccade and ODR tasks, relative to the visually guided saccade and fixation tasks, suggests that modulation of output from ventromedial PFC to limbic cortex and the striatum may play a role in the voluntary control of saccadic eye movements, possibly in the suppression of responses that would interrupt ongoing purposive behavior. 8. During the ODR task, rCBF changes in DLPFC, FEF, SMA, posterior parietal cortex, ventral anterior cingulate, and orbital frontal cortex were highly intercorrelated. A similar pattern of activation across cortical regions was observed during the antisaccade task, with the exception that activation in SMA was independent from rCBF changes observed in other cortical regions. These findings suggest that widely distributed neural circuitry mediates the voluntary control of saccades in humans.",nan; SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA; DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; VISUALLY GUIDED SACCADES; CEREBRAL BLOOD-FLOW; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; BASAL GANGLIA; RHESUS-MONKEY; FUNCTIONAL-PROPERTIES; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; AUTOMATED ALGORITHM

AN INVESTIGATION USING MEASUREMENT OF REGIONAL CEREBRAL BLOOD-FLOW WITH PET AND MOVEMENT-RELATED POTENTIALS IN NORMAL AND PARKINSONS-DISEASE SUBJECTS,"We investigated the functional anatomy of self-initiated and externally triggered movements. Six patients with Parkinson's disease off medication and six age-matched normals were assessed All subjects had regional cerebral blood pow (rCBF) measurement with PET and recording of movement-related cortical potentials (MRPs) from frontal (F), fronto-central (FC), central (C) and parietal (P) sites to obtain measures of the Bereitschaftspotential (BP). The tasks were (i) self-initiated extension of the right index finger on average once every 3 s, (ii) externally triggered finger extension with the rate yoked to the self-initiated task, and (iii) rest condition with tones presented at a rate yoked with the self-initiated task. For the self-initiated movements, the amplitude of the early and peak BP were lower in Parkinson's disease relative to normals. For the externally triggered movements, the patients and the normals did not differ on any of the measures of cortical negativity prior to movement For both groups, the late and peak BP components, but not the early component, had a lower amplitude in the externally triggered than the self-initiated movements. In normals, the left primary sensorimotor cortex, the supplementary motor area bilaterally anterior cingulate, the lateral premotor cortex bilaterally the insular cortex bilaterally, the left thalamus and the left putamen, parietal area 40 bilaterally and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) were significantly activated during the self-initiated movements relative to rest. For the normals, greater activation of the right DLPFC during the self-initiated movements was the only area that significantly differentiated them from the externally triggered movements. When Parkinson's disease patients and normals were compared for the self-initiated movements relative to rest, normals showed greater activation of the supplementary motor area and anterior cingulate, left putamen, left insular cortex, right DLPFC and right parietal area 40. When the groups were compared for the externally triggered movements relative to rest the global pattern of blood pow and rCBF change in the two groups did not differ, confirming the absence of group differences in BPs for the externally triggered movements. During the self-initiated movements, the lower amplitude of the early BP in patients with Parkinson's disease as well as the underactivation of the supplementary motor area relative to normals support the premises that (i) the supplementary motor area contributes to the early BT: and (ii) the deficit in self-initiated movements in Parkinson's disease is due to supplementary motor area underactivation. The DLPFC is activated in situations requiring non-routine decision making as in the self-initiated movements.",PARKINSONS DISEASE; SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA; DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; BEREITSCHAFTSPOTENTIAL; PET; SELF-INITIATED MOVEMENT; SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA; POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; DORSOLATERAL FRONTAL-CORTEX; CORTICAL POTENTIALS; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; FINGER MOVEMENT; MACAQUE MONKEY; VOLUNTARY MOVEMENTS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; PACED MOVEMENT

Hence, projections involved in higher order cognitive processes might be expected to exhibit a lower degree of collateralization than projections that mediate more basic brain functions. This study sought to determine the degree to which neurons projecting from the prefrontal cortex to the nucleus accumbens collateralize to major cortical and subcortical regions: the contralateral prefrontal cortex, the basolateral amygdala or the ventral tegmental area. Fluoro-Gold and cholera toxin-b were used to label prefrontal cortex neurons that project to these targets, and the proportion of neurons singly and dually labeled by immunofluorescence for these tracers was determined. The prefrontal cortex neurons projecting to these regions exhibited a partially complementary laminar distribution. Furthermore, of the neurons projecting to the nucleus accumbens, 13% sent a collateralized projection to the contralateral prefrontal cortex, 7% collateralized to the basolateral amygdala, and 3% sent a branched projection to the ventral tegmental area. No differences were observed in the degree of collateralization of neurons in superficial versus deep layers. Thus, the degree of collateralization of corticoaccumbens neurons was overall limited, but significantly greater to a cortical target than to subcortical regions. These branching patterns provide anatomical substrates for temporal and spatial coordination of activity in limbic circuits. (C) 2000 IBRO.

By design, the two motor tasks differed in the cognitive processing required, In each trial of immediate pointing, the spatial location of only the most recent target needed to be processed, In each trial of pointing to the previous, instead, while the most recent target was stored in memory for the movement of the next trial, the previous target had to be retrieved from memory to direct the current movement, Limb trajectories were comparable between the two motor tasks in terms of most spatiotemporal parameters examined. Significant rCBF increases were identified using analysis of covariance and t statistics. Compared with visual detection there was activation of primary sensorimotor cortex, ventrolateral precentral gyrus, inferior frontal gyrus in the opercular region, supramarginal gyrus, and middle occipital gyrus, all these sites in the hemisphere (left) contralateral to the moving limb, and cerebellar vermis, during both immediate pointing and pointing to the previous. During immediate pointing there was additional activation of left inferior parietal lobule close to the intraparietal sulcus, and when compared with pointing to the previous, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex bilaterally. During pointing to the previous, instead, there was additional activation of supplementary motor cortex, anterior and midcingulate, and inferior occipital gyrus in the left hemisphere; superior parietal lobule, supramarginal gyrus, and posterior hippocampus in the right hemisphere; lingual gyri acid cerebellar hemispheres bilaterally; anterior thalamus; and pulvinar. The activation of two partially distinct cerebral networks in these two motor tasks reflects the different nature of signal processing involved. In particular, the specific activation of intraparietal sulcus and prefrontal cortex in immediate pointing appears characteristic of a network for visuospatial working memory. By contrast, the corticolimbic network engaged in pointing to the previous could mediate spatial attention and the sequence of encoding, recoding, and decoding of spatial memories required by a dual task with two competing targets.

As to the relay cells in cats' lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), they also have weak but significant orientation bias (OB). It is thus of interest to investigate the fine spatiotemporal receptive field (STRF) properties in LGN, compare them with the dynamics of orientation tuning, and examine the dynamic relationship between STRF and orientation sensitivity in LGN. We mapped the STRFs of the LGN neurons in cats with white noise and characterized the dynamics of the orientation tuning by flashing gratings. We found that most of the LGN neurons showed elongated RFs and that the elongation axes were consistent with the preferred orientations. STRFs and the dynamics of orientation tuning were closely correlated temporally: the elongation of RFs and OB emerged, peaked and decayed at the same pace, with unchanged elongation axis of RF and preferred orientation but consistently changing aspect ratio of RF and OB strength across time. Importantly, the above consistency between RF and orientation tuning was not influenced by the ablation of the primary visual cortex. Furthermore, biased orientation tuning emerged 20-30 ms earlier than those in the primary visual cortex. These data demonstrated that similar to the primary visual cortex, the orientation sensitivity was closely reflected by the RF properties in LGN. However, the elongated RF and OB in LGN did not originate from the primary visual cortex feedback. (C) 2018 IBRO. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

Here we asked whether trichromats express chromatic-specific circuitry in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). The volume of parvocellular (P), magnocellular (M), and koniocellular (K) layers was calculated in Nissl-stained sections from the LGN of adult marmosets (Callithrix jacchus; 10 trichromatic females; 2 dichromatic females; and 13 dichromatic males). Retinal ganglion cell axon terminals within the P and K layers were reconstructed and measured following anterograde tracer (dextran) injections. We show that there is little difference in LGN layer volume with respect to age, weight, or sex of the animals, or between dichromatic and trichromatic phenotypes. The morphology of retinal ganglion cell terminals was largely indistinguishable on comparing dichromats and trichromats, and likewise on comparing terminals representing peripheral or foveal retina. We conclude that the LGN circuits we studied are largely independent of red-green color vision phenotype and visual field location.

Here we describe two independent but also interrelated visual systems, one cortical and the other subcortical, both of which have been modified and expanded in primates for different functions. Available evidence suggests that while the cortical visual system mainly functions to give primates the ability to assess and adjust to fluid social and ecological environments, the subcortical visual system appears to function as a rapid detector and first responder when time is of the essence, i.e., when survival requires very quick action. We focus here on the subcortical visual system with a review of behavioral and neurophysiological evidence that demonstrates its sensitivity to particular, often emotionally charged, ecological and social stimuli, i.e., snakes and fearful and aggressive facial expressions in conspecifics. We also review the literature on subcortical involvement during another, less emotional, situation that requires rapid detection and response-visually guided reaching and grasping during locomotion-to further emphasize our argument that the subcortical visual system evolved as a rapid detector/first responder, a function that remains in place today. Finally, we argue that investigating deficits in this subcortical system may provide greater understanding of Parkinson's disease and Autism Spectrum disorders (ASD).",superior colliculus; pulvinar; snake detection theory; faces; primates; evolution; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; FACE-LIKE STIMULI; REDUCED THALAMIC VOLUME; SACCADIC EYE-MOVEMENTS; RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; MONKEYS MACACA-FUSCATA; MEDIAL PULVINAR; RHESUS-MONKEY; PARKINSONS-DISEASE; FEAR-RELEVANT

These components can be difficult to dissociate using retrospective autobiographical stimuli collection. In this study, we manipulated biographical the episodic/semantic distinction within prospectively collected autobiographical stimuli. Over several months, participants made recordings documenting specific episodes, repeated episodes, and world knowledge. These recordings were later played back to participants during scanning with functional MRI. The results indicated overlapping but distinct patterns of brain activity corresponding to episodic and semantic autobiographical memory. Both episodic and semantic autobiographical memory engaged the left anteromedial prefrontal cortex associated with self-reference, but the episodic condition did so to a greater degree. The episodic condition uniquely engaged the medial temporal, posterior cingulate, and diencephalic regions associated with remote memory recovery. Whereas the episodic condition engaged the right temporo-parietal cortex involved in reconstruction of spatial context and attentional orienting, the semantic condition engaged the left temporo-parietal and parieto-frontal systems involved in egocentric spatial processing and top-down attentional control. Episodic recollection was also associated with suppression of emotional paralimbic regions. These findings support a functional neuroanatomical dissociation between episodic and semantic autobiographical memory, providing concordance to amnesic syndromes with disproportionate impairment in one of these two forms of autobiographical memory.",nan; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; MEMORY-RETRIEVAL; RHESUS-MONKEY; FRONTAL LOBES; CORTICOTHALAMIC CONNECTIONS; CORTICAL AFFERENTS; SPATIAL CONTEXT; CORTEX; BRAIN; SELF

Furthermore, AMX-PD 7 rats, but not AMX-PD 21 rats, displayed a reduction in investigatory behavior after prolonged isolation. This indicates that in AMX-PD 21 rats, mainly appetitive motivational aspects of social behavior were affected, whereas in AMX-PD 7 rats both motivational and Consummatory aspects were disturbed.

We localized GM atrophy and confirmed that it is most pronounced within deep GM; 2. We searched for a spatial relationship between WM lesions and deep GM atrophy; to this end we analyzed WM lesion probability maps by voxel-wise multiple regression, including four variables derived from maxima of regional deep GM atrophy (caudate and pulvinar, each left and right). Results: Atrophy of each deep GM region was explained by ipsilateral WM lesion probability, in the area most densely connected to the respective deep GM region.

The development of excitatory activation in the visual cortex was studied in fetal and neonatal cats. During fetal and neonatal life, the immature cerebral cortex (the cortical plate) is sandwiched between two synaptic zones: the marginal zone above, and an area just below the cortical plate, the subplate. The subplate is transient and disappear by approximately 2 mo postnatal. Here we have investigated whether the subplate and the cortical plate receive functional synaptic inputs in the fetus, and when the adultlike pattern of excitatory synaptic input to the cortical plate appears during development. 2. Extracellular field potential recording to electrical stimulation of the optic radiation was performed in slices of cerebral cortex maintained in vitro. Laminar profiles of field potentials were converted by the current-source density (CSD) method to identify the spatial and temporal distribution of neuronal excitation within the subplate and the cortical plate. 3. Between embryonic day 47 (E47) and postnatal day 28 (P28; birth, E65), age-related changes occur in the pattern of synaptic activation of neurons in the cortical plate and the subplate. Early in development, at E47, E57, and P0, short-latency (probably monosynaptic) excitation is most obvious in the subplate, and longer latency (presumably polysynaptic) excitation can be seen in the cortical plate. Synaptic excitation in the subplate is no longer apparent at P21 and P28, a time when cell migration is finally complete and the cortical layers have formed. By contrast, excitation in the cortical plate is prominent in postnatal animals, and the temporal and spatial pattern has changed. 4. The adultlike sequence of synaptic activation in the different cortical layers can be seen by P28. It differs from earlier ages in several respects. First, short-latency (probably monosynaptic) excitation can be detected in cortical layer 4. Second, multisynaptic, long-lasting activation is present in layers 2/3 and 5. 5. Our results show that the subplate zone, known from anatomic studies to be a synaptic neurophil during development, receives functional excitatory inputs from axons that course in the developing white matter. Because the only mature neurons present in this zone are the subplate neurons, we conclude that subplate neurons are the principal, if not the exclusive, recipients of this input. The results suggest further that the excitation in the subplate in turn is relayed to neurons of the cortical plate via axon collaterals of subplate neurons. Thus an intrinsic set of microcircuits is formed in the developing cerebral cortex that exists only transiently during perinatal life and disappears as subplate neurons are eliminated by programmed cell death after birth. 6. Although the ultimate role of these microcircuits in cortical development is unknown, we suggest that subplate neurons, through synaptic function, may act as a crucial temporary link between forming afferent axonal systems from the thalamus and their final targets, the layer 4 cortical neurons.",nan; SOURCE-DENSITY ANALYSIS; EARLY POSTNATAL-DEVELOPMENT; CAT STRIATE CORTEX; ELECTRICALLY EVOKED-POTENTIALS; RAT CEREBRAL-CORTEX; WHITE MATTER; TEMPORAL CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; HORIZONTAL INTERACTIONS; PRENATAL DEVELOPMENT

Four healthy volunteers (27-46 years) were subjected to positron emission tomographic (PET) investigation of regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF), using [O-15]butanol as tracer. The ethanol (20 mu l, 70%) and saline (20 mu l, 0.9%) were injected intracutaneously 3 times in a single-blinded, semi-randomised manner for the pain experiment. All the injections were performed, adjacent to each other, at the lateral aspect of the right upper arm. Subjective sensory intensity of pain, unpleasantness and anxiety were rated with separate 100-mm visual analogue scales together with the Spielberger's State Anxiety Inventory (Spielberger et al. 1970) and heart rate. Paired-subtraction (pixel-by-pixel) between ethanol and saline was performed. Traumatic pain significantly caused higher ratings of intensity and affect scales, i.e., pain intensity, unpleasantness and increased sympathetic activity (evidenced by tachycardia). In contrast the anxiety rating remained unchanged. Acute traumatic nociceptive pain prominently activated the hypothalamus and periaqueductal gray (FAG). In addition, activations of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), insular, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC); posterior parietal cortex (PPC), primary motor/somatosensory areas (MI/SI: face, upper arm), supplementary motor area (SMA), and cerebellum were also demonstrated, The central processing of the pain-relevant/anticipatory arousal also engaged the FAG. This study demonstrates the involvement of the human cerebral cortex in perception, arousal, cognitive evaluative processes, and, hence, affective reactions (somatic/autonomic outflow) associated with pain. The pain stimulus of traumatic character may, by its very nature, evoke the central processing to involve both the hypothalamus and the FAG.",positron emission tomography; regional cerebral blood flow; hypothalamus; periaqueductal gray; pain; trauma; human brain; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; ANTERIOR CINGULATE CORTEX; CEREBRAL BLOOD-FLOW; RHESUS-MONKEY; BRAIN ATLAS; LOCALIZATION; STIMULATION; RESPONSES; ATTENTION; THALAMUS

All cortical sites responding to specific noxious inputs also responded to nonnoxious stimuli, while the reverse was not always true. Evoked responses in S1 area 3b were systematic for nonnoxious inputs, but seen in only half of cases after nociceptive stimulation. Nociceptive responses were systematically recorded when electrode tracks reached the crown of the postcentral gyrus, consistent with an origin in somatosensory areas 1-2. Sites in the precentral cortex also exhibited noxious and nonnoxious responses with phase reversals indicating a local origin in area 4 (M1). We conclude that a representation of thermal nociceptive information does exist in human S1, although to a much lesser extent than the nonnociceptive one. Notably, area 3b, which responds massively to nonnoxious A beta activation was less involved in the processing of noxious heat. S1 and M1 responses to noxious heat occurred at latencies comparable to those observed in the supra-sylvian opercular region of the same patients, suggesting a parallel, rather than hierarchical, processing of noxious inputs in S1, M1 and opercular cortex. This study provides the first direct evidence for a spinothalamic related input to the motor cortex in humans. Hum Brain Mapp 34:2655-2668, 2013.

Gender differences in emotion processing are a common finding in functional neuroimaging studies, and have been documented in behavioral studies of humor, but have received limited attention in functional neuroimaging studies on humor. Using blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) contrasts with high-field (31) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMR) we investigated 29 healthy subjects (14 female, 15 male) during the processing of humorous cartoons. In women, the ventral system implicated in detection and appraisal of emotion was activated, including amygdala, insula, and Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC). Men showed activation in both the ventral and dorsal processing systems. The results indicate that women process humor though limbic reactivity, involving appraisal of its emotional features, while men apply more evaluative, executive resources to humor processing.

Intracellular recordings were made from 43 spinothalamic (STT) neurons in the lumbosacral region of the spinal cord in anesthetized macaque monkeys. The antidromic responses of these neurons to electrical stimulation of the ventral posterior lateral (VPL) nucleus of the thalamus were examined, and orthodromic responses to electrical stimulation of the sural nerve or to mechanical stimulation of hindlimb skin were recorded to study the electrophysiological features of these neurons and their responses to afferent inputs. 2. The resting membrane potential of the neurons ranged from -26 to -70 mV and the antidromic latency from 2.3 to 9.1 ms. Three of the neurons were located in lamina I and were recorded so briefly that only antidromic and spontaneous activity could be studied. The rest of the neurons were located in laminae III-V and were of the wide-dynamic-range (WDR) type. 3. The antidromic action potentials recorded in the somas of STT neurons typically showed a fast rising phase and a short initial segment-somadendritic (IS-SD) delay. After repetitive antidromic stimulation, a progressive elongation of the IS-SD delay, widening of the spike, and failure of the SD spike were observed. 4. The afterpotential of the antidromic action potential consisted of a fast afterhyperpolarization (AHP(f)) and sometimes a delayed depolarization (DD) and a slow afterhyperpolarization (AHP(s)). The amplitude and the duration of the AHP(s) were progressively increased when longer trains of stimuli were used. When the membrane potential was hyperpolarized, the amplitude of the AHP(s) decreased, suggesting an involvement of K+ and/or Cl- ions. However, the AHP(s) completely disappeared when the strength of stimulation was adjusted to a level just below the threshold for the axon, suggesting that it was unlikely that recurrent inhibition contributed to the AHP(s). 5. The background activity of 32 STT neurons was analyzed. The membrane potential at which spikes were triggered in these neurons was around -42 mV. The width and the rise time of the spontaneous spikes were shorter than those of antidromic action potentials, although the maximum rate of rise was similar. The heights of the spontaneous spikes were slightly shorter than those of antidromic action potentials. 6. Three types of background activity have been observed. One type had a very low average spontaneous rate with a bursting firing pattern, consisting of a few spikes superimposed on a depolarization. This type of activity was seen mostly in lamina I neurons. The second type of activity had moderate to high spontaneous rate with a fairly constant interval between spikes. The slowly rising membrane potential between each pair of spikes resembled a pacemaker potential. The third type of activity was a mixture of the previous two. 7. The background firing rates of neurons recorded both extracellularly and intracellularly were not significantly different. Linear correlation analysis showed that the resting membrane potential recorded intracellularly was highly correlated with the height and the width of the antidromic action potential, but was not correlated with the background firing rate of STT neurons recorded intracellularly. 8. Electrical stimulation of the sural nerve evoked depolarizations and discharges in 35 STT neurons tested. Judged by the threshold and the latency of the evoked activity, three components could be distinguished corresponding to A-beta-, A-delta-, and C-afferent inputs. These depolarizations were all excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), because the amplitude of the evoked depolarization was increased (or decreased) when the membrane potential was artifically hyperpolarized (or depolarized). 9. The threshold for EPSPs evoked by A-delta-input (A-delta-EPSPs) was about 5 times the threshold (5T) for the EPSPS evoked by A-beta-input (A-beta-EPSPs). In most cases, the A-delta-EPSPs could be separated from the A-beta-EPSPs by a small dip in the membrane potential and a discontinuation of spike discharges at that time. Furthermore, the membrane conductance increased more during the A-beta-EPSPs than during the A-delta-EPSPs, judging by the amplitudes of the spikes superimposed on the EPSPs. The latency of the potentials evoked by stimulation of the sural nerve and recorded in the dorsal horn indicated that at least some of the A-beta- and A-delta-EPSPs were evoked by monosynaptic input. 10. In 28 of 35 neurons, EPSPs evoked by C-afferent input (C-EPSPs) were recorded after single shock stimulation of the sural nerve. The threshold for the C-EPSPs was approximately 100T, and stronger stimuli evoked larger responses. 11. Repetitive stimulation (2 Hz) of the sural nerve was used to study the C-EPSPs in 13 STT neurons. Some neurons displayed a very synchronized C-EPSP pattern with a reliable latency, whereas some neurons had an unsynchronized or a mixed response pattern. Both incremental increases (wind-up) or decreases (wind-down) of the C-EPSP were observed during repetitive stimulation. In the case of wind-up of the C-EPSP, there was concurrently a wind-down of the A-afferent-evoked response in some neurons and a wind-up in other neurons. During repetitive stimulation, the membrane potential of the neurons recorded did not show any significant change. 12. Hyperpolarizations followed the excitation of some STT neurons by A- or C-afferent inputs. The amplitude of these hyperpolarizations was smaller when the membrane potential was hyperpolarized, suggesting that these potentials were inhibitory post-synaptic potentials (IPSPs). On the basis of the latency and other observations, the IPSPs were more likely to be evoked by small afferent (A-delta- and C-fibers) inputs than by A-beta-afferents. 13. Mechanical stimulation has been used to observe the pattern of EPSPs underlying evoked discharges in 3 STT neurons. Nociceptive stimuli, including pinching and squeezing, evoked larger EPSPs and a higher rate of discharge than did innocuous stimuli, such as brushing.",nan; LUMBAR SPINAL-CORD; SUPERFICIAL DORSAL HORN; GENE-RELATED PEPTIDE; NOXIOUS THERMAL-STIMULATION; POSTERIOR LATERAL NUCLEUS; C-FIBER; SUBSTANTIA GELATINOSA; NOCICEPTIVE NEURONS; MUSCLE AFFERENTS; LAMINA-II

It was found that the DA-like fibers were distributed within the Paleostriatum augmentatum and the dorsal Archistriatum in a dense meshwork of fibers, while most of the remaining part of the caudal forebrain was innervated by dopaminergic axons which were coiled up like baskets around unlabelled neurons. Within the basket-type innervated structures, the Neostriatum caudolaterale (Ncl) could be distinguished by the high density of its dopaminergic fibers. Retrograde tracer injections into Ncl revealed afferents from the Area ventralis tegmentalis (AVT) and the n. tegmenti pedunculo-pontinus pars compacta (TPc). Since large numbers of DA-like perikarya could be detected in AVT and TPc, it is supposed that these two structures constitute the main source of the dopaminergic innervation of the Ncl. Previous studies had suggested that the Ncl represents an avian equivalent to the mammalian prefrontal cortex. The present results reveal an organization similar to that of the mesocortico-prefrontal system and would thus strengthen this hypothesis.",PIGEON; IMMUNOCYTOCHEMISTRY; TELENCEPHALON; TEGMENTUM; SUBSTANTIA-NIGRA; AREA VENTRALIS-TEGMENTALIS; NEOSTRIATUM; RETROGRADE TRACING; THALAMIC MEDIODORSAL NUCLEUS; FRONTAL-CORTEX; COLUMBA-LIVIA; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; TELENCEPHALIC PROJECTIONS; VISUAL-PATTERNS; RHESUS-MONKEY; SUBSTANCE-P; NEURONS; RAT

The study was carried out on male albino rats aged 3, 18, 24 and 28 months. In order to estimate the volume of the dLGN, neuronal volume density, numerical density and total number of neurons, we used serial sections stained according to the Kluver-Barrera technique and stereological methods. We found that dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus volume increases between 3 and 28 months, with a larger increase between 24 and 28 months. Neuronal volume density and numerical density of neurons are greater at 3 months and undergo a significant; decrease between 24 and 28 months. Finally, the total number of neurons is shown to be smaller in adult and old animals than in younger ones, even though no significant variations are found between 18 and 28 months. Furthermore, this study confirms the need to analyze the total number of neurons and not just neuronal density if we want to correctly evaluate some of the microscopic changes occurring during senescence.

This cortical area has traditionally received little attention, mainly because of its hidden location and the virtual absence of focal lesion studies. However, recent functional imaging findings in healthy subjects suggest a central role for the precuneus in a wide spectrum of highly integrated tasks, including visuo-spatial imagery, episodic memory retrieval and self-processing operations, namely first-person perspective taking and an experience of agency. Furthermore, precuneus and surrounding posteromedial areas are amongst the brain structures displaying the highest resting metabolic rates (hot spots) and are characterized by transient decreases in the tonic activity during engagement in non-self-referential goal-directed actions (default mode of brain function). Therefore, it has recently been proposed that precuneus is involved in the interwoven network of the neural correlates of self-consciousness, engaged in self-related mental representations during rest. This hypothesis is consistent with the selective hypometabolism in the posteromedial cortex reported in a wide range of altered conscious states, such as sleep, drug-induced anaesthesia and vegetative states. This review summarizes the current knowledge about the macroscopic and microscopic anatomy of precuneus, together with its wide-spread connectivity with both cortical and subcortical structures, as shown by connectional and neurophysiological findings in non-human primates, and links these notions with the multifaceted spectrum of its behavioural correlates. By means of a critical analysis of precuneus activation patterns in response to different mental tasks, this paper provides a useful conceptual framework for matching the functional imaging findings with the specific role(s) played by this structure in the higher-order cognitive functions in which it has been implicated. Specifically, activation patterns appear to converge with anatomical and connectivity data in providing preliminary evidence for a functional subdivision within the precuneus into an anterior region, involved in self-centred mental imagery strategies, and a posterior region, subserving successful episodic memory retrieval.",precuneus; medial parietal cortex; visuo-spatial imagery; episodic memory; consciousness; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; FRONTAL EYE FIELD; CONSCIOUS RESTING STATE; EPISODIC MEMORY; RHESUS-MONKEY; DEFAULT-MODE; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; CORTICAL NETWORKS; MOTOR IMAGERY; CORTICOTHALAMIC CONNECTIONS

With the present study, we wanted to examine the impact of emotional information on neural correlates of semantic priming, a well-established technique to investigate semantic processing. Stimuli were presented with a short SOA of 200 ms as subjects performed a lexical decision task during fMRI measurement. Seven experimental conditions were compared: positive/negative/neutral related, positive/negative/neutral unrelated, nonwords (all words were nouns). Behavioral data revealed a valence specific semantic priming effect (i.e., unrelated > related) only for neutral and positive related word pairs. On a neural level, the comparison of emotional over neutral relations showed activation in left anterior medial frontal cortex, superior frontal gyrus, and posterior cingulate. Interactions for the different relations were located in left anterior part of the medial frontal cortex, cingulate regions, and right hippocampus (positive > neutral + negative) and left posterior part of medial frontal cortex (negative > neutral + positive). The results showed that emotional information have an influence on semantic association processes. While positive and neutral information seem to share a semantic network, negative relations might induce compensatory mechanisms that inhibit the spread of activation between related concepts. The neural correlates highlighted a distributed neural network, primarily involving attention, memory and emotion related processing areas in medial fronto-parietal cortices. The differentiation between anterior (positive) and posterior part (negative) of the medial frontal cortex was linked to the type of affective manipulation with more cognitive demands being involved in the automatic processing of negative information.

We recently published a study of synaptic properties of connections between the primary and secondary cortical auditory areas in brain slices from the mouse, and, in the present study, we aimed to extend this by performing analogous studies of the primary and secondary visual areas (V1 and V2). Wefound effectively the same results. That is, connections between V1 and V2 in both directions were quite similar; in each case, the glutamatergic inputs could be classified as one of two types, Class 1B (formerly driver) and Class 2 (formerly modulator). There is a clear laminar correlation for these different inputs, in terms of both the laminae of origin and those in which the recorded cells were located.

While a prominent and characteristic feature of this volumetric shift has been the disproportionate expansion of association cortex across our evolutionary lineage, descent with modification is apparent throughout all neural systems in both human and nonhuman primates. However, despite evidence for the ubiquitous and complex influence of evolutionary forces on brain biology, within the psychological sciences the vast majority of the literature on human brain evolution is entirely corticocentric. This selective focus has contributed to a flawed theoretical framework in which the evolution of association cortex is viewed as an isolated process, removed from the rest of the brain. Here, we review our current understanding of how evolutionary pressures have acted across anatomically and functionally coupled networks, highlighting the diverse set of rules and principles that govern human brain development. In doing so we challenge the systemic mischaracterization of human cognition and behavior as a competition that pits phylogenetically recent cortical territories against evolutionarily ancient subcortical and cerebellar systems. Rather, we propose a comprehensive view of human brain evolution with critical importance for the use of animal models, theory development, and network-focused approaches in the study of behavior across health and disease.",brain evolution; cerebral cortex; subcortical; association cortex; network neuroscience; BASAL GANGLIA; AMYGDALOID COMPLEX; CORTICAL PROJECTIONS; FUNCTIONAL-ANATOMY; GENETIC-REGULATION; NEURONAL CIRCUITS; THALAMIC NUCLEI; RHESUS-MONKEY; PRIMATE BRAIN; LIMBIC SYSTEM

We used stereological methods to estimate the volume of the superficial layers, neuron size, and the number of neurons and glial cells in Wistar male rats aged 3, 24, 26, and 28 months. A 32.6% volume increase was found in the stratum griseum superficiale between the ages of 3 and 26 months, while in the 28-month-old animals a 19% decrease was observed. The stratum opticum did not show any changes in volume with age. Also, our analysis revealed a process of somatic and nuclear atrophy in the neurons of the superficial layers in animals aged 26 and 28 months. On the other hand, no statistically significant differences were found in the numbers of neurons. The number of glial cells in the stratum griseum superficiale showed an increase between the 3rd and 26th month, while the stratum opticum suffered no change.

Recordings were made from the lumbosacral spinal cord in anesthetized macaque monkeys. The inhibitory effects of electrical stimulation of the periaqueductal gray (PAG) and the cerebral cortex or cerebral peduncle (CP) were tested and compared by recording 1) cord dorsum potentials evoked by stimulation of the sural nerve, 2) discharges recorded extracellularly, and 3) membrane potentials recorded intracellularly from spinothalamic tract (STT) neurons at rest (background activity) or in response to stimulation of the sural nerve. 2. Stimulation of the cortex or in the CP preferentially reduced the amplitude of the N1 and N2 waves of the cord dorsum potential evoked by stimulation of the sural nerve, without affecting the N3 wave. Stimulation of the PAG, on the other hand, reduced the amplitude of the N3 wave with little effect on the N1 and N2 waves. 3. The activity of 62 STT neurons was recorded extracellularly. Stimulation of the PAG or the cortex/CP inhibited nonpreferentially the responses of the neurons in the superficial laminae to all afferent inputs. On the other hand, stimulation of the PAG or the cortex/CP inhibited preferentially the responses of most STT neurons in deep layers of the dorsal horn to the small or large afferent input, respectively. 4. Thirty-five neurons were recorded intracellularly. The membrane potential of the neurons averaged -45.5 +/- 10.1 (SD) mV. All neurons were recorded in laminae III-VI; the neurons were of the wide-dynamic-range (WDR) type and had background activity. 5. The inhibitory effects of stimulation of the PAG were tested on all 35 neurons. In 32 of the neurons, stimulation of the PAG evoked a hyperpolarization. The background activity of the neurons was reduced (generally it completely ceased) by the hyperpolarization. In three neurons stimulation of the PAG did not evoke a hyperpolarization and the background activity of the neurons did not change. Nevertheless, the responses of these three neurons to afferent input were inhibited by stimulation in the PAG. 6. The inhibitory effects of stimulating the cortex and/or the CP were tested in 26 of the 35 neurons. Stimulation of the cortex and/or the CP evoked a hyperpolarization in all the neurons, although, in 10 of the 26 neurons, stimulation of the CP also evoked a depolarization. The hyperpolarization generally blocked the background activity of the neurons. 7. The effective stimuli in the PAG and the cortex/CP to evoke a hyperpolarization in STT neurons were short, high-frequency trains of pulses. Temporal summation seemed necessary to maintain an effective inhibition of the background activity and the responses of the neurons to afferent inputs. 8. The hyperpolarizations evoked in 5 of 21 neurons after stimulation of the PAG and in 5 of 14 neurons after stimulation of the cortex and/or the CP were inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs). The IPSPs observed were characterized by an increased (or decreased) amplitude during artificial depolarization (or hyperpolarization) of the membrane potential and an increased membrane conductance during the time course of the IPSPs. 9. The evoked IPSPs usually blocked the background activity of STT neurons completely. No preferential inhibition of the responses of the neurons to A-beta-, A-delta-, and C-afferent inputs was found in STT neurons when stimulation of the PAG and the cortex/CP evoked IPSPs. 10. The hyperpolarizations observed in other STT neurons were quite different from IPSPs. The amplitudes of these hyperpolarizations increased (or decreased) when the membrane potential was hyperpolarized (or depolarized) artificially by injecting DC current, just opposite to the changes observed during IPSPs. Furthermore, there was a slightly decreased membrane conductance during the hyperpolarizations. Such characteristics suggested that the hyperpolarizations reflected a disfacilitation. Disfacilitation has been found in 16 neurons after stimulation of the PAG, and in 9 neurons after stimulation of the cortex/CP. 11. In seven neurons, disfacilitation was evoked by stimulation of both the PAG and the cortex/CP, and so the inhibitory effects could be compared. In these neurons, stimulation in the PAG inhibited the responses to small afferent (A-delta- and C-fibers) inputs to STT neurons more than the cortex did, whereas stimulation of the cortex inhibited the responses to A-beta-afferent input more. 12. It is postulated that IPSPs are suitable for controlling the general sensitivity of STT neurons and that disfacilitation is more suitable for controlling selectively the type of afferent input to the neurons so that the coding properties of the neurons can be switched according to various behavioral states.",nan; NUCLEUS RAPHE MAGNUS; SPINAL NOCICEPTIVE TRANSMISSION; PRIMARY AFFERENT DEPOLARIZATION; VPLC THALAMIC NUCLEUS; MEDIAL BRAIN-STEM; DORSAL HORN; QUANTITATIVE CHARACTERIZATION; IONTOPHORETIC APPLICATION; MIDBRAIN STIMULATION; LAMINAE-II

Monkeys were required to fixate the visual target to obtain a drop of apple juice as reward. We found that the probability of eliciting saccades increased with increases in the delay of electrical stimulation relative to target onset. Also, the current threshold to evoke saccades decreased as electrical stimulation was delivered later following target onset. There were major differences in the magnitude of this effect with stimulation of the DMFC versus the FEF. The current threshold to evoke saccades from the DMFC was 16 times greater when electrical stimulation was delivered 200 ms after target onset as compared to when it was delayed 200 ms after target offset.

These brain sex differences present two main characteristics: they are seen in neural circuits related to sexual behavior and sexual physiology and they take one of two opposite morphological patterns (male > female or female > male). The present work reports sex differences in the olfactory system in a large homogeneous sample of men (40) and women (51) using of voxel-based morphology. Gray matter concentration showed sexual dimorphism in several olfactory regions. Women have a higher concentration in the orbitofrontal cortex involving Brodmann's areas 10, 11 and 25 and temporomedial cortex (bilateral hippocampus and right amygdala), as well as their left basal insular cortex. In contrast, men show a higher gray matter concentration in the left entorhinal cortex (Brodmann's area 28), right ventral pallidum, dorsal left insular cortex and a region of the orbitofrontal cortex (Brodmann's area 25). This study supports the hypothesis that the mammalian olfactory system is a sexually dimorphic network and provides a theoretical framework for the morphofunctional approach to sex differences in the human brain.

The societies of spotted hyenas are remarkably like those of cercopithecine primates with respect to size, structure and patterns of competition and cooperation. These similarities set an ideal stage for comparative analysis of social intelligence and nervous system organization. As in cercopithecine primates, spotted hyenas use multiple sensory modalities to recognize their kin and other conspecifics as individuals, they recognize third-party kin and rank relationships among their clan mates, and they use this knowledge adaptively during social decision making. However, hyenas appear to rely more intensively than primates on social facilitation and simple rules of thumb in social decision making. No evidence to date suggests that hyenas are capable of true imitation. Finally, it appears that the gross anatomy of the brain in spotted hyenas might resemble that in primates with respect to expansion of frontal cortex, presumed to be involved in the mediation of social behaviour.",hyena; hyaena; intelligence; social cognition; brain morphology; POST-CONFLICT BEHAVIOR; MACAQUES MACACA-FASCICULARIS; DOMINATED MAMMALIAN SOCIETY; JUVENILE RANK RELATIONS; VERVET MONKEYS; NEOCORTEX SIZE; TRANSITIVE INFERENCE; TERRITORIAL BEHAVIOR; THALAMIC AFFERENTS; PREFRONTAL CORTEX

Functional neuroimaging studies have identified itch-related brain regions. However, no study has investigated the temporal aspect of itch-related brain processing. Here this issue was investigated using electrically evoked itch in ten healthy adults. Itch stimuli were applied to the left wrist and brain activity was measured using magnetoencephalography (MEG) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). In the MEG experiment, the magnetic responses evoked by the itch stimuli were observed in the contralateral and ipsilateral frontotemporal regions. The dipoles associated with the magnetic responses were mainly located in the contralateral (nine subjects) and ipsilateral (eight subjects) secondary somatosensory cortex (SII)/insula, which were also activated by the itch stimuli in the fMRI experiment. We also observed an itch-related magnetic response in the posterior part of the centroparietal region in six subjects. MEG and fMRI data showed that the magnetic response in this region was mainly associated with itch-related activation of the precuneus. The latency was significantly longer in the ipsilateral than that in the contralateral SII/insula, suggesting the difference to be associated with transmission in the callosal fibers. The timing of activation of the precuneus was between those of the contralateral and ipsilateral SII/insula. Other sources were located in the premotor, primary motor, and anterior cingulate cortices (one subject each). This study is the first to demonstrate part of the time course of itch-related brain processing. Combining methods with high temporal and spatial resolution (e.g., MEG and fMRI) would be useful to investigate the temporal aspect of the brain mechanism of itch.",nan; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; HISTAMINE-INDUCED ITCH; SOMATOSENSORY-EVOKED POTENTIALS; POSITRON-EMISSION-TOMOGRAPHY; UNMYELINATED C-FIBERS; HUMAN CEREBRAL-CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; CORTICAL REPRESENTATION; LASER STIMULATION; CORTICOTHALAMIC CONNECTIONS

For example, after a unilateral lesion to striate cortex (V1), an abnormal anatomical pathway can develop between the lateral geniculate nucleus of the undamaged hemisphere and the motion area V5/MT+ in the damaged hemisphere, accompanied by a hypernormal callosal connection between the area V5/MT+ of the two hemispheres. Here we investigated, using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), the functional significance of these pathways in the blindsight subject GY, in whom they were first demonstrated. We show that TMS applied over the extrastriate area V5/MT+ in GY's damaged hemisphere modulates the appearance of phosphenes induced from V1 in the normal hemisphere. In contrast, in neurologically normal control subjects, TMS applied over V5/MT+ never influenced the phosphenes induced from V1 in the other hemisphere. The findings indicate an abnormal functional connectivity between V5/MT in the damaged hemisphere and the early visual cortex in the normal hemisphere, consistent with GY's abnormal anatomical connectivity.",Transcranial magnetic stimulation; Phosphenes; Visual cortex; Lateral geniculate nucleus; Blindsight; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; VISUAL-CORTEX; AREA V5/MT; PERCEPTION; THALAMUS; MACAQUE; MONKEY

Relating primate anatomy to human pathology could provide new venues for identifying molecular, cellular, and connectional factors linked to the degeneration of striatal neurons and circuits. This review describes and summarizes several developmental, cellular, structural, and connectional features of the primate striatum in relation to patterns of neurodegeneration in the striatum of humans and of non-human primate models.

Second, the localizations of retrogradely labelled striatopallidal neurons and of clusters of aggregated striatonigral neurons (as outlined by the transport of C-14-material) were compared in cats that received four horseradish peroxidase-wheat germ agglutinin injections into the internal segment of the globus pallidus and three nigral injections of C-14-amino acids into the substantia nigra pars reticulata. Two types of striatonigral neurons located predominantly within the matrix compartment were identified: poorly collateralized aggregated cells distributed in clusters and more numerous collateralized cells distributed outside the clusters. In addition, two cell types were distinguished within each cluster of aggregated neurons. Those innervating the center of the substantia nigra pars reticulata were observed after a single nigral injection of the tracer, whereas those projecting to distinct sites of the substantia nigra pars reticulata along a rostrocaudal axis were observed only after multiple injections. Striatal neurons innervating the internal segment of the globus pallidus were heterogeneously distributed predominantly within the matrix but outside the clusters of aggregated striatonigral neurons. Together, these results provide further evidence for the heterogeneity of the matrix and for the complexity of matrix striatonigral connections that send both diverging and converging signals to the substantia nigra pars reticulata.

In conjunction with perturbed sensory processing, migraine sufferers often present with diverse neurological manifestations (premonitory symptoms) that highlight potential brainstem involvement. Thus, as the field moves away from the view of migraine as a consequence of purely vasodilation to a greater understanding of migraine as a complex brain disorder, it is critical to consider the underlying physiology and pharmacology of key neural networks likely involved. Discussion The current review will therefore focus on the available evidence for the brainstem as a key regulator of migraine biology and associated symptoms. We will further discuss the potential role of CGRP in the brainstem and its modulation for migraine therapy, given the emergence of targeted CGRP small molecule and monoclonal antibody therapies. Conclusion The brainstem forms a functional unit with several hypothalamic nuclei that are capable of modulating diverse functions including migraine-relevant trigeminal pain processing, appetite and arousal regulatory networks. As such, the brainstem has emerged as a key regulator of migraine and is appropriately considered as a potential therapeutic target. While currently available CGRP targeted therapies have limited blood brain barrier penetrability, the expression of CGRP and its receptors in several key brainstem nuclei and the demonstration of brainstem effects of CGRP modulation highlight the significant potential for the development of CNS penetrant molecules.",Migraine; brainstem; CGRP; GENE-RELATED PEPTIDE; NORADRENERGIC LOCUS-COERULEUS; PERIAQUEDUCTAL GRAY; SPINAL-CORD; FOS EXPRESSION; AREA POSTREMA; THALAMIC PROJECTIONS; SENSORY INNERVATION; ROSTRAL MEDULLA; RHESUS-MONKEY

Neuronal activity, where frequency of tremor appeared to oscillate independently from peripheral input, was encountered in GPi. In contrast, neuronal activity in Vim regarding frequency of firing also correlated with tremor and was passively driven by kinesthetic stimuli with a somatotopic arrangement. Pallidal lesions based on microrecording induced relative reductions of tremor, while small Vim lesions immediately alleviated tremor. Basal ganglia pathology due to dopamine depletion could generate oscillatory neuronal activity in GPi, which may cause tremor. However, peripheral feedback to the motor cortex via Vim is also significant for tremorgenesis, because Vim may be an excitatory driving source for motor cortical neurons. Thus, a Vim lesion could reduce excitability of the motor cortical neurons and abolish tremor.",Parkinson's disease; tremor; central oscillation; peripheral feedback; basal ganglia; Vim; motor cortex; microrecording; stereotactic surgery; pallidotomy; thalamotomy; GLOBUS-PALLIDUS NEURONS; THALAMIC INPUTS; MACAQUE MONKEY; DISEASE; CORTEX; ORIGIN; PROJECTIONS; REFLEXES

Our aim was to determine whether a standard comprehensive assessment of different praxic functions would demonstrate specific types of errors not attributable to bradykinesia, rigidity tremor or any other abnormal elementary motor deficit. PD patients on chronic levodopa treatment were examined in the 'on' and 'off' (treatment) states. Based on apraxia assessment scores, bilateral ideomotor apraxia for transitive movements was found in eight (75%) and 12 (27%) of PSP and PD patients, respectively. Ideomotor apraxia was mainly characterized by spatial errors (i.e. external and internal configuration body-part-as-object and trajectory). Four PSP but no PD patients exhibited ideomotor apraxia for intransitive movements. PSP as well as PD patients with ideomotor apraxia also had difficulties in imitating hand and finger postures, but none of them failed on pantomime comprehension and pantomime recognition/discrimination. Some PSP patients exhibited in addition, a limbkinetic type of apraxia and a minority of them displayed deficits on tasks involving multiple steps. Neither MSA nor NIP patients showed arty disturbance of praxic functions. There were no differences in age, disease duration, Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE), Unified Parkinson's Disease Racing Scale and Hoehn-Yahr scores between apraxic and non-apraxic PD patients, and ideomotor apraxia scores were similar in the 'on' and 'off' states. A correlation was found between ideomotor apraxia scores in PD patients and deficits in frontal lobe-related neuropsychological tasks such as the Tower of Hanoi, verbal fluency and the Trail Making Test. Furthermore, PD patients with apraxia showed higher Hamilton depression scores than non-apraxic PD patients. In PSP patients, ideomotor apraxia scores correlated significantly with cognitive deficit as measured with MMSE. The presence or absence of cortical involvement, and its severity and distribution might determine the presence and type of apraxia in PD and PSP Apraxia in these conditions would therefore reflect combined cortico-striatal dysfunction.",apraxia; Parkinson's disease; progressive supranuclear palsy; multiple system atrophy; neuroleptic-induced parkinsonism; POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; SUPPLEMENTARY MOTOR AREA; RICHARDSON-OLSZEWSKI SYNDROME; GANGLIA-THALAMOCORTICAL CIRCUITS; BASAL GANGLIA; CORTICOBASAL DEGENERATION; IDEOMOTOR APRAXIA; FRONTAL-LOBE; STRIATONIGRAL DEGENERATION; RHESUS-MONKEY

It remains unknown whether visual deprivation affects the topography of V1-extrastriate projections and their relationship with callosal projections. Two anterograde tracers were injected in V1 and multiple retrograde tracer injections were performed in the contralateral hemisphere of intact and enucleated C57BL/6 mice and in ZRDCT/An mice to determine the effects of prenatal and postnatal afferent sensory activity on the topography of V1-extrastriate and callosal projections.

The model accounts for laminar patterns and for the strength and topography of connections between nearby or distant cortices and subcortical structures, exemplified quantitatively for the principal and special prefrontal connections. Widespread connections of limbic areas and focal connections of eulaminate areas yield a broad range of circuit patterns for diverse functions. These diverse pathways innervate excitatory and functionally distinct inhibitory neurons, providing the basis for differential recruitment of areas for flexible behavior.

In addition, men and women differed in a local network centered at the left inferior orbitofrontal cortex.

Several controls were performed for the separation of memory effects from other factors such as attention, stimulus attributes and eye movements. One of the controls employed a standardised sequence of events ('window trial') during which a window in a black screen was opened and a face, an object or a picture was presented. Unit cell activity was recorded from 209 sites in the posterior parietal cortex (area PG) and 186 sites in the pulvinar. Some units responded during the presentation of the DMS stimuli, mostly those in that part of area PG located in the superior temporal sulcus. They often appeared to be related to the task-related state of attention. There was no indication of pure memory-related changes in activity such as sustained responses during the inter-stimulus interval or specific responses to the second stimulus that would indicate a dependence on the kind of the preceding stimulus. In the window trial, some parietal units, mostly in that part of area PG located in the intraparietal sulcus (a region termed area LIP), responded in a relatively specific manner during and sometimes even after, the presentation of a human face. The responses often seemed to be related to the animal's state of attention. Almost no pulvinar unit responded in this paradigm. It is concluded that area PG and, to a lesser extent, the pulvinar are involved in the modulation of attention in relation to behaviourally relevant changes in the environment.

Thus, besides olfactory dysfunctions, it is conceivable that the compromise of these structures can lead to cognitive impairment. The olfactory bulb is affected by alpha-synuclein pathology in almost all cases of both Parkinson's disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. The clinical distinction between these disorders relies on the timing in the appearance of dementia in relationship to motor symptoms. Typically, it occurs late in the course of Parkinson's disease, and within the first year in dementia with Lewy bodies. The close anatomical proximity of the olfactory bulb with limbic regions, together with the early occurrence of cognitive impairment that is observed in dementia with Lewy bodies, raise the question whether the propagation of alpha-synuclein pathology in this condition might originate in the olfactory bulb, spreading from there to other limbic structures, and thereby reaching the associative neocortex.

Furthermore, no prefrontal unit showed unambiguous spatially dependent delay activity that might mediate working memory for spatial locations. Rather, the cells exhibited diverse correlates that were generally associated with the behavioral requirements of performing the task. This included firing related to intertrial intervals, onset or end of trials, selection of specific arms on the eight-arm radial maze, delay periods, approach to or departure from goals, and selection of paths on the figure-eight track. Although a small number of cells showed similar behavioral correlates across tasks, the majority of cells showed no consistent correlate when recorded across multiple tasks. Furthermore, some units did not exhibit altered firing patterns in any of the three tasks, while others showed changes in firing that were not consistently related to specific behaviors or task components. These results are in agreement with previous lesion and behavioral studies in rats that suggest a prefrontal cortical role in encoding 'rules' (i.e. structural features) or behavioral sequences within a task but not in encoding allocentric spatial information. Given that the hippocampal projection to this cortical region is capable of undergoing LTP, our data lead to the hypothesis that the role of this projection is not to impose spatial representations upon prefrontal activity, but to provide a mechanism for learning the spatial context in which particular behaviors are appropriate.",nan; HEAD-DIRECTION CELLS; LONG-TERM POTENTIATION; FREELY MOVING RATS; NO-GO ALTERNATION; RHESUS-MONKEY; UNIT-ACTIVITY; DELAYED-ALTERNATION; HIPPOCAMPAL-FORMATION; DORSOMEDIAL THALAMUS; VENTRAL HIPPOCAMPUS

We analyzed a series of 20 fetal and two adult human brains using Nissl stain, acetylcholinesterase (AChE) histochemistry, and immunocytochemistry for myelin basic protein (MBP), neuronal nuclei antigen (NeuN), a pan-axonal neurofilament marker, and synaptophysin, as well as postmortem 3T MRI. In comparison with other parts of the cerebral cortex, the cytoarchitectural differentiation of the EC begins remarkably early, in the 10th week of gestation (w.g.). The differentiation occurs in a superficial magnocellular layer in the deep part of the marginal zone, accompanied by cortical plate (CP) condensation and multilayering of the deep part of CP. These processes last until the 13-14th w.g. At 14 w.g., the superficial lamina dissecans (LD) is visible, which divides the CP into the lamina principalis externa (LPE) and interna (LPI). Simultaneously, the rostral LPE separates into vertical cell-dense islands, whereas in the LPI, the deep LD emerges as a clear acellular layer. In the 16th w.g., the LPE remodels into vertical cell-dense and cell-sparse zones with a caudorostral gradient. At 20 w.g., NeuN immunoreactivity is most pronounced in the islands of layer II cells, whereas migration and differentiation inside-out gradients are seen simultaneously in both the upper (LPE) and the lower (LPI) pyramidal layers. At this stage, the EC adopts for the first time an adult-like cytoarchitectural organization, the superficial LD becomes discernible by 3T MRI, MBP-expressing oligodendrocytes first appear in the fimbria and the perforant path (PP) penetrates the subiculum to reach its molecular layer and travels along through the Cornu Ammonis fields to reach the suprapyramidal blade of the dentate gyrus, whereas the entorhinal-dentate branch perforates the hippocampal sulcus about 2-3 weeks later. The first AChE reactivity appears as longitudinal stripes at 23 w.g. in layers I and II of the rostrolateral EC and then also as AChE-positive in-growing fibers in islands of superficial layer III and layer II neurons. At 40 w.g., myelination of the PP starts as patchy MBP-immunoreactive oligodendrocytes and their processes. Our results refute the possibility of an inside-out pattern of the EC development and support the key role of layer II prospective stellate cells in the EC lamination. As the early cytoarchitectural differentiation of the EC is paralleled by the neurochemical development, these developmental milestones in EC structure and connectivity have implications for understanding its normal function, including its puzzling modular organization and potential contribution to consciousness content (awareness), as well as for its insufficiently explored deficits in developmental, psychiatric, and degenerative brain disorders.",acetylcholinesterase; Alzheimer's disease; consciousness; cytoarchitecture; entorhinal cortex; lamina dissecans; perforant path; periallocortex; schizophrenia; temporal lobe epilepsy; COLORING THIOCHOLINE METHOD; HUMAN HIPPOCAMPAL-FORMATION; NUCLEUS-REUNIENS-THALAMI; TRANSIENT SUBPLATE ZONE; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; TOPOGRAPHIC ORGANIZATION; INTERSTITIAL NEURONS; AMYGDALOID COMPLEX; PERIRHINAL CORTEX

Recently, we found that the cortical and perceptual changes induced by repetitive somatosensory stimulation (RSS) at a finger transfer to the face. However, whether such cross-border changes are specific to the face remains elusive. Here, we investigated whether RSS-induced acuity changes at the finger can also transfer to the forearm, which is the body part represented on the other side of the hand representation. Our results confirmed the transfer of tactile learning from the stimulated finger to the lip, but no significant changes were observed at the forearm. A second experiment revealed that the same regions on the forearm exhibited improved tactile acuity when RSS was applied there, excluding the possibility of low plastic ability at the arm representation. This provides also the first evidence that RSS can be efficient on body parts other than the hand. These results suggest that RSS-induced tactile learning transfers preferentially from the hand to the face rather than to the forearm. This specificity could arise from a stronger functional connectivity between the cortical hand and face representations, reflecting a fundamental coupling between these body parts.",nan; SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; CORTICAL REORGANIZATION; AREA 3B; THALAMOCORTICAL CONNECTIONS; MACAQUE MONKEYS; DISCRIMINATION; PLASTICITY; BORDER; REPRESENTATIONS; MAPS

To this end, three rhesus monkeys were rendered hemiparkinsonian by intracarotid injections of MPTP. The animals then received intra-SNr injections of the GABA, receptor agonist muscimol to inactivate small portions of the SNr, Before and after these injections, parkinsonian motor signs were evaluated with a battery of behavioral observation methods. Injections into the centrolateral SNr reduced contralateral limb akinesia and bradykinesia in two animals. By contrast, medial injections induced generalized activation, contralateral turning, and saccadic eye movements in all animals. Injections in the most lateral and posterior portions of the nucleus had no effects. Two of the animals also received ibotenic acid lesions of the SNr, followed by a series of similar observations. These injections induced improvements in limb akinesia, postural improvements, and turning. The experiments suggest that the anterolateral motor territory of the SNr is involved in the development of appendicular parkinsonian motor signs.

The higher resolution tracers - Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin (PHA-L), biocytin, biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) and dextran-conjugates -have already produced new results, simply by providing improved visualization, concerning laminar definition and possible subtypes of connections, as well as the beginning of a database of morphometrics and microstructure. The comparative approach, comparing geniculocortical terminations and cortical connections across several areas, has suggested both specific structural-functional correlations (for example, in extrastriate area MT/V5) and more subtle, possibly gradient-wise variations. Likely future directions for this line of research include more direct correlations of axon geometry with functional architectures, investigations of microcircuitry at the level of electron or confocal microscopy, anatomical and functional investigations of connectional convergence and interactions, and, not least, a more comprehensive database.

Although topography is often found in projections from peripheral sense organs to the brain, it also seems to participate in the anatomical and functional organization of higher brain centers, for reasons that are poorly understood. We propose that a key function of topography might be to provide computational underpinnings for precise one-to-one correspondences between abstract cognitive representations. This perspective offers a novel conceptualization of how the brain approaches difficult problems, such as reasoning and analogy making, and suggests that a broader understanding of topographic maps could be pivotal in fostering strong links between genetics, neurophysiology and cognition.",nan; VISUAL-CORTEX; PREFRONTAL CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; THALAMOCORTICAL PROJECTIONS; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; CORTICAL AREAS; MOTOR CORTEX; ORGANIZATION; RECEPTOR; MAPS

Moving-bar visual stimuli of different extension, stimuli moving in different directions, the impact of non-specific cortical activation upon synchronous oscillation, and the frequency content of EEG associated with synchrony were considered. The magnitude of zero lag synchrony was primarily accounted for by the properties of the eigenmodes of the travelling local field potential superposition waves generated by inputs to the cortex, largely independent of the oscillation properties and associated spectral content. Approximation of the differences in cross-correlation observed with differently moving bar stimuli, and of the impact of cortical activation, required added assumptions on (a) spatial coherence of efferent volleys al-ising from parts of a single stimulus object and (b) the presence of low-amplitude diffuse held noise, with enhancement of cortical signal/noise ratio with respect to the spatially coherent inputs, at higher levels of cortical activation. Synchrony appears to be a ubiquitous property of cortex-like delay networks. Precision in the modelling of synchronous oscillation findings will require detailed description of input pathways, cortical connectivity, cortical stability, and aspects of cortical/subcortical interactions.",nan; MONKEY STRIATE CORTEX; VISUAL-CORTEX; THALAMOCORTICAL SYSTEM; LATERAL CONNECTIVITY; NEURAL DYNAMICS; MACAQUE MONKEY; SYNCHRONIZATION; MODEL; RHYTHMS; BRAIN

The study was carried out with monkeys that either had intact brains or had one hemisphere deprived of visual input by unilateral optic tract section combined in some cases with forebrain commissurotomy. The metabolic mapping revealed activation of sensorimotor cortex only in the hemisphere contralateral to the moving forelimb, irrespective of whether this hemisphere was intact or visually deafferented. These results suggest that visually guided reaching with the forelimb contralateral to the ''blind'' hemisphere is sub-served by that hemisphere's sensorimotor cortex and not by the cortex of the ipsilateral, ''seeing'' hemisphere. Other areas that were more active metabolically in the ''blind'' than in the ''seeing'' hemisphere included the supplementary motor, the secondary somatosensory, and certain posterior parietal cortical areas, intraparietal lateral 5 (lateral 5-ip), 7a, and intraparietal 7 (7-ip). It is suggested that the ''blind'' hemisphere utilizes at least two distinct pieces of information to guide forelimb movements to visual targets: (1) information about the location of the visual target derived from head and eye movements made to this target and mediated via the inferior parietal cortical areas 7a and 7-ip, and (2) information about the instantaneous upper extremity position derived from forelimb proprioceptive mechanisms and mediated via the somatosensory cortex and thereafter via the superior parietal cortical area, lateral 5-ip.",ARM REACHING; MOTOR CORTEX; SENSORY CORTEX; VISUAL CORTEX; AREA-7; AREA-5; VISUOMOTOR TASK; SPLIT-BRAIN MONKEYS; C-14-DEOXYGLUCOSE METHOD; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; PRIMATE MOTOR CORTEX; CORTICO-CORTICAL CONNECTIONS; DIMENSIONAL ARM MOVEMENTS; LATERAL THALAMIC REGION; SOMATIC SENSORY CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEY; 3-DIMENSIONAL SPACE; ASSOCIATION CORTEX; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY

Full definition of these areas will require a combination of functional and histological methods but, by using six complementary histological methods, of which most have been used in the monkey, we provide a clearer description of these areas. The primary auditory area was located on the posteromedial two-thirds of the first transverse temporal (Heschl's) gyrus and was distinguished by a dense band of cytochrome oxidase activity in layer IV and the base of layer III, as well as a relatively thick, pale layer V and VI. Layers V and VI together made up 40% of the cortical thickness. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-containing pyramidal cells were sparsely distributed within the primary auditory area. The anterolateral third of Heschl's gyrus did not have a clear band of high cytochrome oxidase activity but contained a moderately high density of AChE-containing pyramidal cells and thus appeared to be part of the auditory belt. Within Heschl's sulcus there was a third area, which had a band of high cytochrome oxidase activity and bands of high parvalbumin immunoreactivity and AChE activity in layer IV. This area appeared to be part of the auditory core. Thus the use of staining methods for cytochrome oxidase, AChE and parvalbumin provided additional information which allowed a clearer definition of auditory areas than Nissl or myelin staining alone. Our results suggest that there are two core areas surrounded by at least six belt areas in the human auditory region.",architectonic; temporal lobe; auditory system; primary auditory cortex; BINDING PROTEIN IMMUNOREACTIVITY; TONOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; CYTOCHROME-OXIDASE; MACAQUE MONKEYS; PARVALBUMIN IMMUNOREACTIVITY; HUMAN THALAMUS; CORTEX; ACETYLCHOLINESTERASE; SUBDIVISIONS; CONNECTIONS

This study investigates the potential roles of feedback interactions in neural information processing. We consider a two-layer continuous attractor neural network (CANN), in which neurons in the first layer receive feedback inputs from those in the second one. By utilizing the intrinsic property of a CANN, we use a projection method to reduce the dimensionality of the network dynamics significantly. The simplified dynamics allows us to elucidate the effects of feedback modulation analytically. We find that positive feedback enhances the stability of the network state, leading to an improved population decoding performance, whereas negative feedback increases the mobility of the network state, inducing spontaneously moving bumps. For strong, negative feedback interaction, the network response to a moving stimulus can lead the actual stimulus position, achieving an anticipative behavior. The biological implications of these findings are discussed.

One of these circuits, the motor circuit, is critically involved in the development of parkinsonian motor signs. Current pathophysiologic models postulate that parkinsonism is associated with increased activity in the basal ganglia output nuclei. The neuronal activity in the motor portion of one of these output nuclei, the internal segment of the globus pallidus (GPi), has been characterized in detail in intact and parkinsonian animals, but the neuronal activity in the second major basal ganglia output nucleus, the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), has received far less attention. This study in primates represents a comparison of the effects of parkinsonism, induced by injections of the dopaminergic neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP), on the neuronal discharge in the GPi and SNr. These electrophysiologic recording experiments were carried out in three African green and two rhesus monkeys. One hundred and twenty-four neurons were recorded in the GPi before treatment with MPTP, and 93 neurons thereafter. In the SNr, 55 cells were recorded before treatment with MPTP, and 41 cells thereafter. MPTP induced a non-significant increase in the average discharge rate and a significant decrease in the median interspike interval length (ISI) in the GPi (by 13%), whereas no changes were detected in either parameter in the SNr. The average ISI distributions were markedly asymmetric in both structures, and could be modeled by a logarithmic normal distribution. With the MPTP treatment, the mode of the ISI distribution fell by 24% in the GPi (P less than or equal to 0.01), whereas it did not change significantly in the SNr. An algorithm that detects burst discharges in the raw ISI data (based on the method by Legendy and Salcman) detected a significant increase in the proportion of action potentials that participated in bursts of discharge in both structures (increase by 257% in the GPi, and by 67% in the SNr). Power spectral and autocorrelation analysis revealed that treatment with MPTP increased the proportion of cells with oscillatory burst patterns at 3-8 Hz in both structures (from 0.8% to 27% of all neurons in the GPi, and from none to 10% in the SNr). The results show that neuronal discharge in the SNr is affected in parkinsonism, but that the changes in the SNr are less pronounced then those seen in the GPi.","substantia nigra; MPTP; parkinsonism; primate; electrophysiology; basal ganglia; PEDUNCULOPONTINE TEGMENTAL NUCLEUS; ADVANCED PARKINSONS-DISEASE; BASAL GANGLIA; GLOBUS-PALLIDUS; SUBTHALAMIC NUCLEUS; FUNCTIONAL-ANATOMY; 1-METHYL-4-PHENYL-1,2,3,6-TETRAHYDROPYRIDINE MPTP; MOTOR THALAMUS; RHESUS-MONKEY; PALLIDOTOMY"

Here we tested, in rats, the hypothesis that BLA is critical for conditioned reinforcer devaluation during the period when the primary reinforcer (food) is being devalued (by feeding it to satiety), but not thereafter for guiding behavioral choices. We used a spatially independent task that used two visual cues, each predicting one of two foods. An instrumental action (lever press) was required for reinforcer delivery. After training, rats received BLA or sham lesions, or cannulae implanted in BLA. Under control conditions (sham lesions, saline infusions), devaluation of one food significantly decreased responding to the cue associated with that food, when both cues were presented simultaneously during extinction. BLA lesions impaired this devaluation effect. Transient inactivation of BLA by microinfusion of the gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor type A agonist muscimol resulted in an impairment only when BLA was inactivated during satiation. When muscimol was infused after satiation and therefore, BLA was inactivated only during the choice test, rats showed no impairment. Thus, BLA is necessary for registering or updating cues to reflect updated reinforcer values, but not for guiding choices once the value has been updated. Our results are the first to describe the contribution of rat BLA to specific components of reinforcer devaluation and are the first to show impairment in reinforcer devaluation following transient inactivation in the rat.",muscimol; pharmacological inhibition; lesion; reward; goal-directed behavior; ORBITAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; RHESUS-MONKEYS; MEDIODORSAL THALAMUS; NEUROTOXIC LESIONS; REWARD VALUE; TASK; CONNECTIONS; INHIBITION; MACAQUES

Using simulations of cerebral cortex and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) we show patterns of zero-lag synchronisation (associated with empirically realistic spectral content) can arise from both linear and nonlinear mechanisms. For low levels of activation, we show the synchronous field is described by the eigenmodes of the resultant damped wave activity. The first and second spatial eigenmodes (which capture most of the signal variance) arise from the even and odd components of the independent input signals. The pattern of zero-lag synchronisation can be accounted for by the relative dominance of the first mode over the second, in the near-field of the inputs. The simulated cortical surface can act as a few millisecond response coincidence detector for concurrent, but uncorrelated, inputs. As cortical activation levels are increased, local damped oscillations in the gamma band undergo a transition to highly nonlinear undamped activity with 40 Hz dominant frequency. This is associated with locking between active sites and spatially segregated phase patterns. The damped wave synchronisation and the locked nonlinear oscillations may combine to permit fast representation of multiple patterns of activity within the same field of neurons.",synchronous oscillation; Principal Component Analysis; zero-lag synchronisation; cortical activation; spatial eigenmode; nonlinear phase locking; stimulus feature binding; CAT VISUAL-CORTEX; THALAMOCORTICAL SYSTEM; NEURONAL OSCILLATIONS; COUPLED OSCILLATORS; NEURAL DYNAMICS; PYRAMIDAL CELLS; MACAQUE MONKEY; STRIATE CORTEX; SYNCHRONIZATION; CONNECTIONS

Subjects were three males and three females who were candidates for neurosurgical treatments of partial epilepsy. Subdural electrodes were attached to the medial and basal temporal lobe cortices, allowing ECoG and electroencephalogram from the scalp vertex (Cz EEG) to be recorded simultaneously during all night sleep. In one case, subdural electrodes were attached also on the parietal lobe. Fast Fourier transformation (FFT) analyses were performed on the ECoG and Cz EEG signals. No organized sleep spindles or sigma band (12-16 Hz) peaks in FFT power spectra were observed from the medial or basal temporal lobes of the non-epileptogenic hemispheres during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. In a case with parietal electrodes, organized spindle bursts were observed in parietal signals synchronized with Cz spindles. Although delta band (0.3-3 Hz) power from both the medial and basal temporal lobes fluctuated across each night as expected, sigma activity changed little. However, 14 Hz oscillatory bursts were observed in the medial basal temporal lobe of epileptogenic hemisphere in two cases and bilaterally in one case during not only NREM sleep but rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and wakefulness. From the present study we conclude that sleep spindle activities are absent in the medial and basal temporal lobes. Fourteen Hz oscillatory bursts observed from the medial or basal temporal lobe in some cases were not considered to be sleep spindles since they also appeared during REM sleep and wakefulness.

The movements evoked by the NL mainly concerned forelimb and head segments. Only in a few cases were movements of hindlimb segments evoked. Motor effects were obtained according to a precise topographical pattern. This pattern delimited functional zones, or representations, within the NL, each zone being specifically related to a particular segment of the body. A few body segments were activated from single zones only (single representation) whereas some other body segments could be activated from different zones of the NL. Among them, the axio-proximal body segments were activated in a similar way from all sites (multiple representation) whereas the distal body segments were differently activated from the various representation zones (specific representation). The multiple and specific representations were distributed between the 3 cytoarchitectonic subregions of the NL (NLm, DLH and slp) in such a way that the body segments were usually represented only once in each individual NL subregion. Each NL subregion included sets of representations concerning body segments characterized by a topographical continuity (e.g. the different segments of the forelimb in both DLH and slp). Thus, the individual NL subregions may bring into play coordinate plurisegmental muscular activities of the limbs and/or of the head. The NLm controls movements of all the segments of the head and those of axio-proximal segments of both limbs. The DLH particularly controls movements of the head, including both the proximal (neck) and the oral regions. To a lesser degree, DLH controls movements of the various segments of the forelimb, including synchronous flexion of all the digits. The slp is specifically involved in the control of motor activities of: i) the proximal segment of the head (rotation of the neck) as well as its distal segments (displacement of individual vibrissae, rotation of the ear pinna) and ii) the various segments of the forelimb including individual digits. Functionally, the proximal segments would be concerned in the spatial displacement of the limbs or of the head whereas the distal segments would be involved in the realization of precise and discrete movements related to specific functions of the distal segments concerned. The 3 subregions of the NL may be concerned in different motor functions. The results suggest the involvement of: i) the NLm in the postural adjustments of the body, or of part of it; ii) the DLH in motor behaviours which integrate the oral and the forelimb motor activities; iii) the slp in exploratory activities (by moving individual vibrissae, the ear pinna and individual digits) and/or in discrete manipulative activities.",CEREBELLUM; NUCLEUS LATERALIS; RAT; MOTOR ORGANIZATION; MICROSTIMULATION; MOTOR CORTEX; FUNCTIONAL-ORGANIZATION; TOPOGRAPHIC ORGANIZATION; THALAMIC PROJECTIONS; INFERIOR AREA-6; MACAQUE MONKEY; MOVEMENTS; FORELIMB; HAND; BODY

It is believed that anatomical connectivity can be used to probe hierarchical organization, however direct characterization of this principle in-vivo within humans remains elusive. Here, we use resting-state functional connectivity as a complement to anatomical connectivity to investigate topographical principles of human S1. We employ a novel approach to examine mesoscopic variations of functional connectivity, and demonstrate a topographic organisation spanning the region's hierarchical axis that strongly correlates with underlying microstructure while tracing along architectonic Brodmann areas. Our findings characterize anatomical hierarchy of S1 as a 'continuous spectrum' with evidence supporting a functional boundary between areas 3b and 1. The identification of this topography bridges the gap between structure and connectivity, and may be used to help further current understanding of sensorimotor deficits.",Somatosensory cortex; Hierarchy; Gradients; Functional connectivity; BODY-SURFACE REPRESENTATIONS; FUNCTIONAL CONNECTIVITY; CORTICOCORTICAL CONNECTIONS; CUTANEOUS REPRESENTATIONS; ANTERIOR PULVINAR; MACAQUE MONKEYS; CORTICAL AREAS; PROJECTIONS; MOTOR; THALAMUS

These differences indicate a different circuit design for mouse V1 than that of cat or monkey. Here we develop a large-scale computational model of an effective input layer of mouse V1. Constrained by experiment data, the model successfully reproduces experimentally observed response properties-for example, distributions of firing rates, orientation tuning widths, and response modulations of simple and complex neurons, including the contrast dependence of orientation tuning curves. Analysis of the model shows that strong feedback inhibition and strong orientation-preferential cortical excitation to the excitatory population are the predominant mechanisms underlying the contrast-sharpening of OS in excitatory neurons, while the contrast-broadening of OS in inhibitory neurons results from a strong but nonpreferential cortical excitation to these inhibitory neurons, with the resulting contrast-broadened inhibition producing a secondary enhancement on the contrast-sharpened OS of excitatory neurons. Finally, based on these mechanisms, we show that adjusting the detailed balances between the predominant mechanisms can lead to contrast invariance-providing insights for future studies on contrast dependence (invariance).",orientation selectivity; contrast invariance; contrast dependence; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; SIMPLE CELLS; RECEPTIVE-FIELDS; RESPONSE PROPERTIES; CORTICAL-NEURONS; THALAMIC INPUT; MACAQUE V1; INHIBITION; ORGANIZATION; INVARIANT

Pathological changes in white matter are evident in adults with autism, particularly affecting axons below the anterior cingulate cortices (ACC). It is still unknown whether axon pathology appears early or late in development and whether it changes or not from childhood through adulthood. To address these questions, we examined typical and pathological development of about 1 million axons in post-mortem brains of children, adolescents, and adults with and without autism (ages 3-67years). We used high-resolution microscopy to systematically sample and study quantitatively the fine structure of myelinated axons in the white matter below ACC. We provide novel evidence of changes in the density, size and trajectories of ACC axons in typical postnatal development from childhood through adulthood. Against the normal profile of axon development, our data revealed lower density of myelinated axons that connect ACC with neighboring cortices in children with autism. In the course of development the proportion of thin axons, which form short-range pathways, increased significantly in individuals with autism, but remained flat in controls. In contrast, the relative proportion of thick axons, which form long-range pathways, increased from childhood to adulthood in the control group, but decreased in autism. Our findings provide a timeline for profound changes in axon density and thickness below ACC that affect axon physiology in a direction suggesting bias in short over distant neural communication in autism. Importantly, measures of axon density, myelination, and orientation provide white matter anisotropy/diffusivity estimates at the level of single axons.

Here, we examined the relationship between the heterogeneity of neuronal responses and population coding.

We examined the effects of extrinsic (i.e., distance) and intrinsic (i.e., size) properties of the second target on the various kinematic phases of reaching-grasping. We randomly varied distance and size of both stimuli across the experimental session. The kinematics of the reach initial phase of both patients and controls was influenced by the distance of both the first and the second target. In particular, peak acceleration increased far farther position of the second target. However, in the subsequent phase, patients, differently from controls, modified their reaching kinematics, removing the effects of second target position. These results were due neither to a visual interference effect of the second target on reaching-grasping nor to the complexity of movement sequence. Finally, the size of the second target did not affect grasp kinematics of both patients and controls. The results of the present study support the hypothesis that PD patients are able to compute the general program of an action in which extrinsic properties of both the actual and the final target are computed. However, PD patients re-program movement during its execution. This suggests a decay of the motor program.

We used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) during tonic painful heat stimulation to test the hypothesis of increases in both glutamate and GABA, two neurotransmitters with a key role in pain processing. Using a 3 T MR scanner, we acquired spectra from the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) in 13 healthy right-handed subjects at rest and during painful heat Stimulation. The Painful stimulus consisted Of a suprathreshold painful tonic heat Pulse, Which was delivered to the right upper leg via a fMRI-compatible Peltier element. Compared to non-painful Stimulation, painful tonic heat was associated with a significant increase in GABA concentrations in the rACC. No changes in glutamate concentrations were detected during noxious stimulation. This study provides the first evidence that GABA is released in the human cerebral cortex during painful stimulation. The results are in line with animal findings on the role of GABA in pain processing and with studies in humans showing analgesic efficacy of GABA-related drugs in clinical pain conditions.

Recent experiments have suggested that alpha band activity originating from the pulvinar coordinates this inter-areal cortical communication. Using a computer model we investigated whether top-down induced shifts in the relative alpha phase between two cortical areas could modulate cortical communication, quantified in terms of changes in gamma band coherence between them. The network model was comprised of two uni-directionally connected neuronal populations of spiking neurons, each representing a cortical area. We find that the phase difference of the alpha oscillations modulating the two neuronal populations strongly affected the interregional gamma-band neuronal coherence. We confirmed that a higher gamma band coherence also resulted in more efficient transmission of spiking information between cortical areas, thereby confirming the value of gamma coherence as a proxy for cortical information transmission. In a model where both neuronal populations were connected bi-directionally, the relative alpha phase determined the directionality of communication between the populations. Our results show the feasibility of a physiological realistic mechanism for routing information in the brain based on coupled oscillations. Our model results in a set of testable predictions regarding phase shifts in alpha oscillations under different task demands requiring experimental quantification of neuronal oscillations in different regions in e.g. attention paradigms.",nan; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; INFORMATION-TRANSMISSION; NEURONAL SYNCHRONIZATION; BRAIN OSCILLATIONS; OCCIPITAL CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; HUMAN THALAMUS; IN-VITRO; ATTENTION; COHERENCE

Thus, it is possible that eye-hand coordination may differ in these two types of movement. To examine this issue we compared the response characteristics of combined eye and hand movements made towards visual versus remembered targets. In addition, the influence of the eye movement on the hand movement was investigated by comparing the effects of visual fixation in each task. Our results demonstrated that hand movement amplitude was greater when the hand movements were produced in isolation versus in combination with an eye movement. This was true regardless of whether the movement was made to a visual or a remembered target. This suggests that the integration of eye position information into the manual motor response occurs at a common neural site for both tasks. By contrast, the timing between saccade and hand onsets and offsets differed in the two conditions. This is consistent with the idea that the timing inherent in eye-hand coordination is the result of separate processing within either the basal ganglia or cerebellar systems. Taken together, the results from this study demonstrate that certain processes underlying eye-hand coordination during movements to visual versus remembered targets share a common neural substrate whereas others function independently.",eye-hand coordination; basal ganglia; cerebellum; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; PREMOTOR CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; BASAL GANGLIA; ARM MOVEMENTS; SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; HEAD MOVEMENTS; THALAMIC INPUT; LIMB MOVEMENTS; SUPPLEMENTARY

This operation leads to many characteristic cortical nonlinearities in integrating multiple stimuli. The cortical computation must combine such local processing with hierarchical processing across areas.

The strength of bimodal-cell response to a visual stimulus depends on its proximity to the hand. We tested the hypothesis that hand proximity to a visual stimulus would influence unconscious residual vision in the blind field. MB is a 26-year-old man with a dense upper-left quadrantanopia following surgical treatment that severed Meyer's loop, and SB is a 35-year-old man with a dense left hemianopia following childhood meningitis. Testing for hand-assisted blindsight in MB allowed us to evaluate whether phenomena related to hand proximity are dependent on information relayed through the optic radiations. We presented target objects of different sizes to the blind fields of these gentlemen, and asked them to estimate target size with their right hand by adjusting thumb-finger distance or reaching and grasping the object. Concurrently, we varied the location of the resting left hand. In the hand-far condition, the left hand rested on their lap, and in the hand-near condition, it was placed just to the left of the target object. In the hand-far condition, both patients showed no scaling of either size-estimation aperture (SEA) or peak grip aperture PGA) to object size. In the hand-near condition, however, both PGA and SEA were scaled to object size. Additional studies of MB suggest that hand proximity effects cannot be attributed solely to changes in spatial attention. These results imply that if bimodal cells are recruited when the hand is placed nearby the visual target, they must receive information from cortical areas that do not depend on the integrity of the optic radiations.

In Experiment 1, we showed that a simultaneous auditory stimulus increases sensitivity, but not response biases, to the detection of an electrical cutaneous stimulus delivered to the hand. Experiment 2 demonstrated that this enhancement of somatosensory perception is spatially specific-only monaural sounds on the same side increased detection. Experiment 3 revealed that the effects of audition on touch are also frequency dependent-only sounds with the same frequency as the vibrotactile frequency enhanced tactile detection.

To study the effect of these connections on neural responses, we recorded spikes and local field potentials (LFPs) from multi-electrode arrays that were implanted in monkey and cat primary visual cortex. Spikes at each location generated outward traveling LFP waves. When the visual stimulus was absent or had low contrast, these LFP waves had large amplitudes and traveled over long distances. Their effect was strong: LFP traces at any site could be predicted by the superposition of waves that were evoked by spiking in a similar to 1.5- mm radius. As stimulus contrast increased, both the magnitude and the distance traveled by the waves progressively decreased. We conclude that the relative weight of feedforward and lateral inputs in visual cortex is not fixed, but rather depends on stimulus contrast.

By using behavioral tasks together with electro-physiological recordings it has been possible to advance in our understanding on the functional role of this area. Given its pattern of connections, the premotor ventral cortex is well suited to participate in perceptual decisions, in which sensory information is combined with knowledge on previous outcomes and expectancies to reach a behavioral choice. The neuronal correlates of the decision process have been described in several cortical areas of primates. In this work we describe our experimental results showing that different stages or elements of perceptual decisions are encoded in the firing rate of premotor ventral cortex neurons. This provides compelling evidence suggesting that this area is involved in the use of sensory evidence-maintained in working memory or retrieved from long-term memory-to reach a decision. Furthermore, after the behavioral response the same neurons convey all the information needed to evaluate the outcome of the choice. This suggests that the premotor ventral cortex could participate in shaping future behavior as a result of this evaluation.",Decision-making; Errors; Individual neurons; Monitoring of behaviour; Performance evaluation; Ventral premotor cortex; CORTICAL AREAS; MACAQUE MONKEYS; BASAL GANGLIA; FRONTAL-LOBE; CORTICOSPINAL PROJECTIONS; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; THALAMIC INPUTS; PARIETAL CORTEX; MOTOR CORTEX; CONNECTIONS

We injected the tracer CTb into V1 of juvenile ferrets, and visualized the pattern of labeled axon terminals in extrastriate cortex. Bouton density of FF projections to target areas 18, 19, and 21 declined steadily from 4 to 8 weeks postnatal.

During this postnatal period, mean interbouton intervals along individual FF axons to all visual areas increased, and we observed a concomitant moderate decrease in axon density in areas 18, 21, and Ssy. These data suggest that FF circuits linking V1 to its main extrastriate targets remodel largely synchronously in the weeks following eye opening, that FF and FB cortical circuits share a broadly similar developmental timecourse, and that postnatal visual experience is critical for the refinement of both FF and FB cortical circuits.",Corticocortical; Extrastriate; Visual development; V1; CORTICAL AREA V2; B SUBUNIT CTB; CALLOSAL CONNECTIONS; MACAQUE MONKEY; MAGNETIC-RESONANCE; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; CHOLERA-TOXIN; CORTICOCORTICAL CONNECTIONS; HIERARCHICAL DEVELOPMENT; THALAMOCORTICAL AXONS

Sensory processing and the influence of attention in the pulvinar appeared to reflect its cortical inputs. However, pulvinar deactivation led to a reduction of attentional effects on firing rates and gamma synchrony in V4, a reduction of sensory-evoked responses and overall gamma coherence within V4, and severe behavioral deficits in the affected portion of the visual field. Conversely, pulvinar deactivation caused an increase in low-frequency cortical oscillations, often associated with inattention or sleep.

The supratemporal regions of four normal human brains (eight hemispheres) were processed histologically, and serial sections were stained for parvalbumin, calretinin or calbindin.

Calretinin labelling was lighter than that of parvalbumin or calbindin in AI; calretinin-positive bipolar and bitufted neurons were present in supragranular layers. In non-primary auditory areas, the intensity of labelling tended to become progressively lighter while moving away from AI, with qualitative differences between the cytoarchitectonically defined areas.

Here we report the effects, on the gain of LGN neurons, of differentially stimulating the extraclassical receptive field, with feedback from the striate cortex intact or inactivated in the marmoset monkey, Callithrix jacchus. A horizontally oriented grating of optimal size, spatial frequency, and temporal frequency was presented to the classical receptive field. The grating varied in contrast (range: 0-1) from trial to trial, and was presented alone, or surrounded by a grating of the same or orthogonal orientation, contained within either a larger annular field, or flanks oriented either horizontally or vertically. V1 was ablated to inactivate cortico-geniculate feedback. The maximum firing rate of LGN neurons was greater with V1 intact, but was reduced by visually stimulating beyond the classical receptive field. Large horizontal or vertical annular gratings were most effective in reducing the maximum firing rate of LGN neurons. Magnocellular neurons were most susceptible to this inhibition from beyond the classical receptive field. Extraclassical inhibition was less effective with V1 ablated. We conclude that inhibition from beyond the classical receptive field reduces the excitatory influence of V1 in the LGN. The net balance between cortico-geniculate excitation and inhibition from beyond the classical receptive field is one mechanism by which signals relayed from the retina to V1 are controlled.",marmoset; cortico-geniculate feedback; gain; context; THALAMIC RETICULAR NUCLEUS; NEW-WORLD MONKEY; VISUAL-CORTEX; CORTICOFUGAL FEEDBACK; STRIATE CORTEX; CALLITHRIX-JACCHUS; MACAQUE LGN; RELAY CELLS; CAT; ORGANIZATION

Anatomical studies have delineated multiple areas in and around primary auditory cortex and demonstrated connectivity among these areas, as well as between these areas and the rest of the cortex, including prefrontal cortex. Physiological recordings of auditory neurons have found that species-specific vocalizations are useful in probing the selectivity and potential functions of acoustic neurons. A number of cortical regions contain neurons that are robustly responsive to vocalizations, and some auditory responsive neurons show more selectivity for vocalizations than for other complex sounds. Demonstration of selectivity for vocalizations has prompted the question of which features are encoded by higher-order auditory neurons. Results based on detailed studies of the structure of these vocalizations, as well as the tuning and in formation-coding properties of neurons sensitive to these vocalizations, have begun to provide answers to this question. In future studies, these and other methods may help to define the way in which cells, ensembles, and brain regions process communication sounds. Moreover, the discovery that several nonprimary auditory cortical regions may be multisensory and responsive to vocalizations with corresponding facial gestures may change the way in which we view the processing of communication information by the auditory system.",prefrontal cortex; acoustic; communication; temporal lobe; complex sounds; frontal lobe; SUPERIOR TEMPORAL SULCUS; DORSOLATERAL PREFRONTAL CORTEX; LATERAL FRONTAL LESIONS; THALAMOCORTICAL CONNECTIONS; FUNCTIONAL SPECIALIZATION; MULTISENSORY CONVERGENCE; TONOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; RHESUS MACAQUES; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; UNIT-ACTIVITY

In order to gauge the potential therapeutic benefits of neuroprotective or restorative treatments, it is necessary to create an animal model that is associated with readily measurable and long-lasting functional impairments. The undifferentiated neostriatum and limited behavioural repertoire of rodents have led to the extension of our investigations into the common marmoset, We have used quinolinic acid to create unilateral excitotoxic lesions of the caudate nucleus or the putamen in this small non-human primate, Following rigorous investigation of each monkey on a battery of behavioural tests, we found that the unilateral putamen lesion mas associated with a contralateral motor impairment that persisted for at least 9 months and withstood repeated testing, However, the unilateral caudate nucleus lesion did not appear to be associated with any detectable motor deficit. The stability and the reproducibility of the unilateral putamen lesion in the marmoset provide a suitable tool for the investigation of potential treatments for neurodegenerative disorders that attack this region of the brain.",striatum; Huntington's disease; excitotoxin; primate; STRIATAL DOPAMINE DEPLETION; SKILLED FORELIMB USE; KAINIC ACID LESIONS; ADULT-RAT BRAIN; HUNTINGTONS-DISEASE; QUINOLINIC ACID; CAUDATE-PUTAMEN; CORTICOSTRIATAL PROJECTIONS; THALAMOCORTICAL CIRCUITS; MACACA-FASCICULARIS

Animal work demonstrates that interactions among these regions are critical for flexible feedback-guided learning, but it remains unknown to what extent such anatomical-functional interactions operate in humans. Here, we use connectivity analyses in both structural and functional MRI to further our understanding of how brain circuits work in conjunction to promote goal-directed behavior. In particular, fiber tracking based on diffusion-weighted imaging provides information about anatomical connectivity between brain structures, and functional MRI provides estimates of functional connectivity between structures. We found that, during a feedback-guided reversal learning task, the strength of estimated white matter tracts from the amygdala to the hippocampus, orbitofrontal cortex, and ventral striatum predicted both how subjects adapted their behavior following positive and negative feedback, and the functional connectivity (estimated from functional MRI time series) between the amygdala and these regions. In addition, we identified a dissociation between an amygdala-hippocampus circuit that predicted response switching, and an amygdala-orbitofrontal cortex circuit that predicted learning following rule reversals. These findings provide novel insights into how the anatomy and functioning of amygdala-related brain circuits mediate different aspects of feedback-guided learning behavior. (c) 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Impaired smooth pursuit in humans with cerebral lesions usually signifies damage to posterior parietal hemispheric regions. The authors have recently studied horizontal smooth pursuit in 23 patients with discrete unilateral cerebral hemispheric lesions. Ten patients had pursuit asymmetry with lower gain when tracking toward the side of cerebral hemispheric damage. None had lower gain when tracking away. Two patients with lower ipsilateral gain had frontal lobe lesions. Areas of anatomical overlap of lesions associated with asymmetric pursuit in eight patients provide evidence for a pursuit pathway that originates in Brodmann's areas 19 and 39 (angular gyrus), and that these cortical areas are the human homologues of areas MT and MST in the simian cerebral cortex. A normal phase relationship between smooth eye motion and target motion in these patients indicated that prediction in the smooth pursuit system is resistant to cerebral hemispheric damage. The initiation of smooth pursuit in response to step-ramp targets was studied in 18 patients with focal cerebral hemispheric lesions. Seven patients had retinotopic pursuit defects, consisting of low smooth eye movement gain in both horizontal directions in the hemifield contralateral to the cerebral lesions. Only four of those seven patients had complete hemianopia and three had normal visual fields, indicating that 'blindness' for motion detection and/or motion generation can occur independently of damage to the geniculostriate pathway. Four patients with complete hemianopia occasionally made smooth eye accelerations to targets stepped into the blind hemifield, in the correct direction, but with low velocity. They did not adjust saccade amplitude to the direction or size of the target step. These measurements of steady state responses to sine wave targets and to step ramp targets enabled the authors to identify four classes of cerebral hemispheric smooth pursuit defects: (1) Ipsilateral low gain pursuit. Contralateral pursuit gain may be normal, low or high. (2) Bidirectional low gain smooth pursuit. (3) Retinotopic impairment of pursuit in both directions in the contralateral visual field.

Intense staining for both the unphosphorylated and the phosphorylated forms of the AMPA receptor subunit GluR1 was observed in the cell bodies and proximal dendrites of neurons in this nucleus. In comparison to GluR1, less intense staining for GluR2/3 was observed in the cell bodies and processes. NMDAR1 immunoreactivity was present in cell bodies and large numbers of small diameter dendrites. Light staining was observed in cell bodies with mGluR1a and no staining was observed on cell bodies with mGluR5. The neuropil, however, contained many processes that were labeled for mGluR1a or mGluR5. Electron microscopy showed that label was present in cytoplasmic locations in cell bodies and dendrites, in addition to components of the synaptic region, in sections stained for GluR1, GluR2/3 and NMDAR1. In contrast, very lightly labeled or unlabeled cell bodies but labeled dendrites and axon terminals, was observed in sections stained for mGluR1a and mGluR5. In addition to neural processes, occasional astrocytic processes were also labeled for mGluR5. Of the immunogold particles that were associated with components of the synaptic region, label for ionotropic glutamate receptors was mostly present on postsynaptic densities, whilst that for metabotropic glutamate receptors was mostly present in a perisynaptic location. The ratio of GluR1/GluR2 messenger RNAs has been reported to increase in the aged hippocampus (PAGLIUSI, S. R., GERRARD, P., ABDALLAH, M., TALABOT, D. & CATSICAS, S. (1994) Neuroscience 61, 429-433.), and it is possible that a similar change in the ratio of GluR1 and GluR2 may occur in neurons of the subthalamic nucleus with age. It is postulated that this could result an increase in calcium permeability via AMPA receptors, and an enhancement of excitatory transmission in this nucleus.",nan; PARAFASCICULAR THALAMIC NUCLEI; FRONTAL EYE FIELD; EFFERENT CONNECTIONS; RAT HIPPOCAMPUS; FUNCTIONAL EXPRESSION; MACACA-FASCICULARIS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; SQUIRREL-MONKEY; MESSENGER-RNA; GLUR1 SUBUNIT

The latter are nearly exclusively of the spinous type and are predominantly located in upper layer IV. Retrograde transport of the carbocyanine dye DiI, applied to the corpus callosum, showed that, up to P6, all callosally projecting neurons resemble pyramids in the possession of an apical dendrite reaching layer I. At P10. however, callosally projecting neurons with stellate morphology were found. A study was designed to distinguish whether these neurons are late in extending their axons to the corpus callosum or, alternatively, have transient apical dendrites. To this end, callosally projecting neurons were retrogradely labeled by fluorescent beads injected in areas 17 and 18 at P1-P3 and then either relabeled with DiI applied to the corpus callosum at P10 or intracellularly injected with Lucifer Yellow at P57. Double-labeled stellate and pyramidal cells were found in similar proportions to those found for the total, single-labeled population of callosally projecting neurons. It is therefore concluded that callosally projecting spiny stellate cells initially possess an apical dendrite and a pyramidal morphology. At P6, i.e. close to the time when stellate cells appear, layer IV neurons with an atrophic apical dendrite were found, suggestive of an apical dendrite in the process of being eliminated.",CEREBRAL CORTEX; CORPUS CALLOSUM; DENDRITES; SPINY STELLATE NEURONS; KITTEN; MONKEY STRIATE CORTEX; THALAMIC RECIPIENT NEURONS; POSTNATAL-DEVELOPMENT; DENDRITIC GROWTH; ELECTRON-MICROSCOPY; IDENTIFIED NEURONS; MACACA-NEMESTRINA; SPINE ACQUISITION; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; GANGLION-CELLS

Striosomes were visualized in all striatal regions but the anterior two thirds of the CN tail. They were highly immunoreactive (-ir) for ENK and LAMP, devoid of PV and AChE staining, and surrounded by a ring of tissue with pale TH- and CB-ir neuropil. In the Put, other rings of tissue completely free of ENK labeling surrounded certain striosomes (clear septa). In the CN body, gyrus and tail some markers revealed gradients and heterogeneities along the dorsoventral and mediolateral axes. A rim of striatal tissue densely stained for ENK and LAMP and poorly labeled for PV was noticeable along the lateral edge of the Put and the dorsolateral sector of the CN body.

The present electrophysiological study identified the corresponding area in rats as a vagal afferent projection region and examined the cytoarchitecture. Electrical stimulation of the cervical vagus nerve elicited a field potential comparable in waveform, latency, and amplitude to the simultaneously evoked potential in the insular Visceral sensory cortex. The potential field adjoined the S1 trigeminal region without overlap, and was rostroventral to the lip representation barrel field, which was identified histochemically, and rostrodorsal to the tongue representation region, which was identified electrophysiologically. The vagal potential underwent a phase reversal in the middle layers; thus, the current sink site was cytoarchitectonically identified as the most rostral part of the parietal granular cortex or the S1, where no somatosensory input has previously been demonstrated. The rat S1 contains a region representing general visceral information, topographically located as if the visceral organs protruded from the mouth.

Cortex rostral and caudal to the primary somatosensory area (SI) contained neurons that responded to stimulation of deep receptors and to muscle and joint manipulation. The region of cortex rostral to SI was termed the rostral field (R) because of possible homologies with a similar field described in other mammals. Cortex caudal to SI had neurons that responded to stimulation of deep receptors and has been termed the parietal medial area (PM), as in previous investigations in squirrels. Like SI, both R and PM contained a complete or almost complete representation of the body surface, although the receptive field size for clusters of neurons in these regions was somewhat larger than those for clusters of neurons in SI. Electrophysiological recording results were correlated with histologically processed tissue that had been sectioned tangentially. Although SI was clearly identified as a myelin-dense region, both R and PM stained much less densely for myelin. Our results indicate that as in a number of other mammals including monotremes, marsupials, carnivores, and primates, the anterior parietal cortex of the California ground squirrel contains multiple representations of the sensory epithelium. This work, as well as a growing body of studies of somatosensory cortex organization in a variety of mammals, indicates that anterior parietal fields other than SI existed early in mammalian evolution, and were present in the common ancestor of all mammals.

A battery of attentional, motion and mnemonic processing tasks were used and performance was examined during deactivation of each region. The results show a clear dissociation of functions. Deactivation of MS cortex resulted in profound deficits on a visual orienting task and on the discrimination of direction of motion, whereas deactivation of vPS cortex severely impaired both retention and learning of novel and overlearned object discriminations. In addition, deactivation of either MS or vPS cortex impaired discrimination of learned patterns when components of the patterns were in motion, whereas only deactivation of vPS cortex impaired the discrimination when all components were static. Together, these results show that a region of parietal cortex contributes to the processing of visual motion and to attentional processes, whereas a region of temporal cortex contributes to the learning and recognition of three-dimensional objects and two-dimensional patterns. This functional dissociation is linked to differences in underlying visual pathways, which have many features in common with the parietal and temporal visual processing streams previously identified in monkeys and humans. Furthermore. the broad similarity in neural operations carried out in parietal and temporal cortices of cats, monkeys and humans suggests the existence of a common plan for cortical processing machinery within mammals with well developed cerebral cortices.",nan; LATERAL SUPRASYLVIAN CORTEX; RETINOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; MOTION PERCEPTION; CEREBRAL-CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; THALAMIC PROJECTIONS; SELECTIVE IMPAIRMENT; CORPUS-CALLOSUM; BEHAVING CAT; AREA 20

In turn, the CM/Pf complex receives a substantial innervation from the internal globus pallidus (GPi). In this study, we demonstrate that the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr) also provides a massive input to Pf in monkeys. These pallidothalamic and nigrothalamic projections provide routes whereby information can flow in functional loops between the basal ganglia and the intralaminar nuclear group. To understand better the anatomical organization and the degree of functional specificity of these loops, we combined retrograde and anterograde labeling methods from functionally defined regions of the striatum and GPi/SNr to determine the relationships between thalamostriatal neurons and basal ganglia afferents. Together with previous studies, our data suggest the existence of tightly connected functional circuits between the basal ganglia and the CM/Pf in primates: 1) A sensorimotor circuit links together the medial two-thirds of CM, the postcommissural putamen, and the ventrolateral part of the caudal GPi; 2) a limbic circuit involves the rostral one-third of Pf, the ventral striatum, and the rostromedial pole of GPi; and 3) an associative circuit exists between the caudal two-thirds of Pf, the caudate nucleus, and the SNr. An additional associative circuit that involves the caudate-receiving territory of GPi (dorsal one-third), the dorsolateral Pf (Pfdl), and the precommissural putamen was also disclosed. In conclusion, findings of this study provide additional evidence for the high degree of functional specificity of the thalamostriatal system through which CM/Pf may provide attention-specific sensory information important for conditional responses to the primate striatum.

An ideal testbed for such models is the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Mechanisms shaping LGN responses include the linear receptive field and two fast adaptation processes, sensitive to luminance and contrast. We propose a compact functional model for these mechanisms that operates on sequences of arbitrary images. With the same parameters that fit the firing rate responses to simple stimuli, it predicts the bulk of the firing rate responses to complex stimuli, including natural scenes. Further improvements could result by adding a spiking mechanism, possibly one capable of bursts, but not by adding mechanisms of slow adaptation. We conclude that up to the LGN the responses to natural scenes can be largely explained through insights gained with simple artificial stimuli.",nan; RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; CONTRAST GAIN-CONTROL; PRIMARY VISUAL-CORTEX; RECEPTIVE-FIELD ORGANIZATION; LIGHT ADAPTATION; THALAMOCORTICAL RELAY; SPATIAL SUMMATION; MACAQUE MONKEY; NEURAL CODE; CAT RETINA

Of these, the orbital network and the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex both receive multimodal sensory inputs and appear to function as regions for integration of this information, with an important role in the assessment of sensory objects or stimuli. The orbital network receives prominent olfactory, taste, and visceral inputs, as well as visual and somatosensory inputs; it is probably especially important for assessment of food. The ventrolateral prefrontal region does not receive olfactory or taste visceral inputs but does receive the same visual and somatosensory inputs, as well as auditory inputs.

We observed specific multi-dimensional distributions over the spinal segments for small immunopositive cells in Rexed laminae II-III and medium-to-large cells of varying morphology in lamina I and laminae V-VIII. The small neurons in laminae II-III were clustered into the columns along the dorsal horn curvature. The medium-to large cells were grouped into four assemblages that were located in (1) the most lateral region of lamina VII at the L1-L4 level; (2) the laminae IV-V boundary at the L5-L7 level; (3) the lamina VII dorsal border at the L5-L7 level; and (4) the lamina VIII at the L5-S3 level. The data obtained suggest that the morphological and physiological heterogeneity of calbindin immunolabeling cells formed morphofunctional clusters over the gray matter.

Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, we investigated the cortical sensory representation of the oral area, including the teeth. First, we identified the somatotopic representation of the lips, teeth and tongue in the postcentral gyrus (GpoC). Tactile stimuli were applied to the lower lip, tongue and teeth. The foci activated by each stimulus were characterized by the center of gravity (COG) of activated areas. Secondly, we examined the rostro-caudal changes in the somatotopic organization in the GPoC in terms of the overlap between each sensory representation. In the rostral portion of the GPoC, the COG of the representation of teeth was located significantly superior to that of the tongue and inferior to that of the lip, consistent with the classical 'sensory homunculus' proposed by Penfield; however, this somatotopic representation became unclear in the middle and caudal portions of the GPoC. The overlap between each representation in the middle and caudal portions of the GPoC was significantly greater than that in the rostral portion of the GPoC.

Specifically, auditory inputs were shown to suppress activations in visual cortices when presented alone but amplify the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) responses to concurrent visual inputs (and vice versa). This concurrent transcranial magnetic stimulation-functional magnetic resonance imaging (TMS-fMRI) study applied repetitive TMS trains at no, low, and high intensity over right intraparietal sulcus (IPS) and vertex to investigate top-down influences on visual and auditory cortices under 3 sensory contexts: visual, auditory, and no stimulation. IPS-TMS increased activations in auditory cortices irrespective of sensory context as a result of direct and nonspecific auditory TMS side effects. In contrast, IPS-TMS modulated activations in the visual cortex in a state-dependent fashion: it deactivated the visual cortex under no and auditory stimulation but amplified the BOLD response to visual stimulation. However, only the response amplification to visual stimulation was selective for IPS-TMS, while the deactivations observed for IPS- and Vertex-TMS resulted from crossmodal deactivations induced by auditory activity to TMS sounds. TMS to IPS may increase the responses in visual (or auditory) cortices to visual (or auditory) stimulation via a gain control mechanism or crossmodal interactions.

Here we asked if orientation selectivity, once established, is altered by successive stages of cortical processing. We measured patterns of orientation selectivity at all depths of the cat's visual cortex by making whole-cell recordings with dye-filled electrodes. Our results show that the synaptic representation of orientation indeed changes with position in the microcircuit, as information passes from layer 4 to layer 2+3 to layer 5. At the earliest cortical stage, for simple cells in layer 4, orientation tuning curves for excitation (depolarization) and inhibition (hyperpolarization) had similar peaks (within 0-7 deg, n = 11) and bandwidths. Further, the sharpness of orientation selectivity covaried with receptive field geometry (r = 0.74) - the more elongated the strongest subregion, the shaper the tuning. Tuning curves for complex cells in layer 2+3 also had similar peaks (within 0-4 deg, n = 7) and bandwidths. By contrast, at a later station, layer 5, the preferred orientation for excitation and inhibition diverged such that the peaks of the tuning curves could be as far as 90 deg apart (average separation, 54 deg; n = 6). Our results support the growing consensus that orientation selectivity is generated at the earliest cortical level and structured similarly for excitation and inhibition. Moreover, our novel finding that the relative tuning of excitation and inhibition changes with laminar position helps resolve prior controversy about orientation selectivity at later phases of processing and gives a mechanistic view of how the cortical circuitry recodes orientation.",nan; RECEPTIVE-FIELD STRUCTURE; CORTICAL SIMPLE CELLS; SHREW STRIATE CORTEX; DIRECTION SELECTIVITY; SPATIAL SUMMATION; COMPLEX CELLS; SYNAPTIC INTEGRATION; LOCAL CIRCUITS; MACAQUE MONKEY; THALAMIC INPUT

II. Effect of muscimol inactivation of the caudal fastigial nucleus,"The medioposterior cerebellum [vermian lobules VI and VII and caudal fastigial nucleus (cFN)] is known to play a major role in the control of saccadic gaze shifts toward a visual target. To determine the relative contribution of the cFN efferent pathways to the brainstem reticular formation and to the superior colliculus (SC), we recorded in the head-unrestrained cat the effects of cFN unilateral inactivation on gaze shifts evoked by electrical microstimulation of the deeper SC layers. Gaze shifts evoked after muscimol injection still exhibited the typical qualitative features of normal saccadic gaze shifts. Nevertheless, consistent modifications in amplitude and latency were observed. For ipsiversive movements (evoked by the SC contralateral to the inactivated cFN), these changes depended on the locus of stimulation on the motor map: for the anterior 2/3 of the SC, amplitude increased and latency tended to decrease; for the posterior 1/3 of the SC, amplitude decreased and latency increased. For the contraversive direction, amplitude moderately decreased and latency tended to increase for all but the caudal-most stimulated SC site. These modifications of SC-evoked gaze shifts during cFN inactivation differed from the ipsiversive hypermetria/contraversive hypometria pattern observed for visually triggered gaze shifts recorded during the same recording sessions. We conclude that (i) the topographical organization of gaze shift amplitude in the deeper SC layers is influenced by the cerebellum and is either severely distorted or demonstrates an amplitude reduction during inactivation of the contralateral or ipsilateral cFN, respectively; (ii) gaze shifts evoked by SC microstimulation and visually triggered gaze shifts either rely on distinct cerebellar-dependent control processes or differ by the location of the caudal-most active SC population. We present a functional scheme providing several predictions regarding the modulatory influence of the cerebellum on SC neuronal activities and on the topographical organization of fastigial-SC projections.",cerebellum; dysmetria; eye movement; saccade; tectum; SACCADIC EYE-MOVEMENTS; THALAMIC SUPRAGENICULATE NUCLEUS; PONTINE RETICULAR-FORMATION; HORSERADISH-PEROXIDASE; CEREBELLAR VERMIS; MACAQUE MONKEYS; OCULOMOTOR REGION; PURKINJE-CELLS; PREPOSITUS-HYPOGLOSSI; EFFERENT PROJECTIONS

To examine whether STSd makes a similar contribution to visual recognition memory, performance on visual delayed nonmatching-to-sample (DNMS) was assessed in rhesus monkeys with combined or separate ablations of the perirhinal cortex and STSd as well as in unoperated controls. Consistent with previous findings, ablations of perirhinal cortex produced deficits nearly as severe as that found after rhinal (i.e., entorhinal plus perirhinal) cortex lesions. However, combined lesions of perirhinal cortex and STSd produced a deficit no greater than that produced by perirhinal cortex ablation alone, and lesions of STSd alone were without effect on DNMS.

We varied stimulus luminance to alter the timing and magnitude of visual responses in the SC and examined how these changes correlated with resulting saccade behavior. Increasing target luminance resulted in multiple modulations of the visual response, including increased magnitude and decreased response onset latency. These signal modulations correlated strongly with changes in saccade latency and metrics, indicating that these signal properties carry through to the neural computations that determine when, where and how fast the eyes will move. Thus, components of the earliest part of the visual response in the SC provide important building blocks for the neural basis of the sensorymotor transformation, highlighting a critical link between the properties of the visual response and saccade behavior.",contrast; eye movement; monkey; sensorimotor integration; stimulus intensity; visuomotor transformation; THALAMIC RETICULAR NUCLEUS; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; FRONTAL EYE FIELD; MACAQUE AREA V4; EXPRESS SACCADES; REACTION-TIMES; SPATIAL ATTENTION; NEURONAL-ACTIVITY; STRIATE CORTEX; MONKEY

The aim of the present study was to elucidate the mechanisms of surround suppression in V1. Using stationary-flashed sinusoidal grating as stimuli, we observed temporal changes of surround suppression in V1 and the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and of the response to CRF stimulation in V1. The spatial frequency (SF) tuning of surround suppression in V1 neurons changed over time after the stimulus onset. In the early phase (< 50 ms), the SF tuning was low-pass, but later became band-pass that tuned to the optimal SF in response to CRF stimulation. On the other hand, the SF tuning of CRF responses in V1 was band-pass throughout the response time whereas the SF peak shifted slightly toward high SF. Thus, SF tuning properties of the CRF response dissociated from that of surround suppression in V1 only in the early phase. We also confirmed that the temporal changes of the SF tuning of surround suppression in the LGN occurred in the same direction as surround suppression in V1, but the shift from low-pass to band-pass SF tuning started later than that in V1. From these results, we suggest that subcortical mechanisms contribute to early surround suppression in V1, whereas cortical mechanisms contribute to late surround suppression.",coarse-to-fine processing; cortical mechanism; extraclassical receptive field; spatiotemporal dynamics; subcortical mechanism; CLASSICAL RECEPTIVE-FIELD; RETINAL GANGLION-CELLS; CONTEXTUAL RESPONSE MODULATION; MACAQUE V1; STRIATE CORTEX; ORIENTATION SELECTIVITY; FEEDBACK CONNECTIONS; THALAMIC AFFERENTS; INTEGRATION FIELD; CORTICAL-NEURONS

A Bayesian modeling approach to quantify the probability of ipsilateral activations revealed that areas OP 1, OP 4, and OP 3 of the SII cortex as well as the trunk and face representations within all SI subareas (areas 3b, 1, and 2) show robust bilateral responses to unilateral stimulation. Such bilateral response properties are in good agreement with the transcallosal projections demonstrated for these areas in nonhuman primates and other mammals. In contrast, the SI hand region showed a different pattern. Whereas ipsilateral areas 3b and 1 were deactivated by tactile hand stimulation, particularly on the left, there was strong evidence for ipsilateral processing of information from the right hand in area 2. These results demonstrate not only the behavioral importance of the hand representation, but also suggest that area 2 may have particularly evolved to form the cortical substrate of these specialized demands, in line with recent studies on cortical evolution hypothesizing that area 2 has developed with increasing manual abilities in anthropoid primates featuring opposable thumbs.",nan; HUMAN PARIETAL OPERCULUM; MEDIAN NERVE-STIMULATION; NEW-WORLD MONKEYS; SOMATOTOPIC ORGANIZATION; MACAQUE MONKEYS; CORTICAL AREAS; CYTOARCHITECTONIC AREAS; THALAMIC CONNECTIONS; BODY-SURFACE; CORTICOCORTICAL CONNECTIONS

It is well known that different visual functions and their underlying circuitry mature and attain adultlike characteristics at different stages in postnatal development with varying growth rates. The developmental timecourse and duration of refinement varies significantly both in V1 of various species and among different visual cortical areas; while basic visual functions like spatial acuity mature earlier requiring less time, higher form perception such as contour integration is more complex and requires longer postnatal time to refine. This review will highlight the importance of systematic comparative analysis of the differential rates of refinement of visual circuitry and function as that may help reveal underlying key mechanisms necessary for healthy visual development during infancy and adulthood.

We propose a quantitative framework whereby this drive represents a multisensory self-motion estimate computed through an internal model that uses sensory prediction errors of vestibular, visual, and somatosensory cues to improve on-line motor drive. We show how restraint-dependent strength of recurrent connections within the attractor can explain differences in head direction cell firing between free foraging and restrained passive rotation. We also summarize recent findings on how gravity influences azimuth coding, indicating that the velocity drive is not purely egocentric. Finally, we show that the internal compass may be three-dimensional and hypothesize that the additional vertical degrees of freedom use global allocentric gravity cues.",nan; FREELY MOVING RATS; NUCLEUS-RETICULARIS GIGANTOCELLULARIS; MEDIATED EQUILIBRIUM REFLEXES; ANGULAR PATH-INTEGRATION; SPATIAL ORIENTATION; ANTERIOR THALAMUS; DROSOPHILA-MELANOGASTER; MULTIMODAL INTEGRATION; VESTIBULOOCULAR REFLEX; MACAQUE CEREBELLUM

These studies highlighted the need for detailed anatomic analyses to delineate its many cortical fields more clearly. In the present study, neurofilament protein, and the calcium-binding proteins parvalbumin, calbindin, and calretinin were used as neurochemical markers to study the differences among areas and subareas in the distributions of particular cell types or neuropil staining patterns. The most rostral parts of the anterior cingulate cortex were marked by a lower density of neurofilament protein-containing neurons, which were virtually restricted to layers V and VI. Immunoreactive layer III neurons, in contrast, were sparse in the anterior cingulate cortex, and reached maximal densities in the posterior cingulate cortex. These neurons were more prevalent in dorsal than in ventral portions of the gyrus. Parvalbumin-immunoreactive neurons generally had the same distribution. Calbindin- and calretinin-immunoreactive nonpyramidal neurons had a more uniform distribution along the gyrus. Calbindin-immunoreactive pyramidal neurons were more abundant anteriorly than posteriorly, and a population of calretinin-immunoreactive pyramidal-like neurons in layer V was found largely in the most anterior and ventral portions of the gyrus. Neuropil labeling with parvalbumin and calbindin was most dense in layer III of the anterior cingulate cortex. In addition, parvalbumin-immunoreactive axonal cartridges were most dense in layer V of area 24a. Calretinin immunoreactivity showed less regional specificity, with the exception of areas 29 and 30. These chemoarchitectonic features may represent cellular reflections of functional specializations in distinct domains of the cingulate cortex.

The responses of 126 neurons in primary gustatory cortices of two rhesus monkeys were recorded during sapid stimulation of the tongue with 18 taste stimuli. Ten of these stimuli were dissolved in distilled water (DW): 1.0 M sucrose (Suc), 0.1 M and 0.03 M sodium chloride (NaCl), 0.003 M hydrochloric acid (HCl), 0.001 M quinine hydrochloride (QHCl), 0.03 M monosodium glutamate (MSG), 0.03 M polycose, 0.3 M glycine, 0.1 M proline, and 0.1 M malic acid. Seven other stimuli were dissolved in 0.03 M MSG; the last stimulus was a mixture of 1.0 M Suc and 0.03 M NaCl. 2. The average spontaneous rate (2.2 +/- 0.2 spikes/s, mean +/- SE) and response to DW (2.5 i 0.2) of these 126 neurons was low but within the range previously reported for neurons in primate taste cortex. Suc was the most effective stimulus for 24.1% of the neurons tested followed by NaCl (15.7%), QHCl (14.8%), HCl (11.1%), MSG (10.2%), and other miscellaneous unitary gustatory stimuli (8.3%). Binary taste mixtures were the most effective stimuli for 15.7% of the sample. The net responses (corrected for DW, in spikes/s) for Sue-best (3.3), NaCl-best (4.3), HCl-best (3.4), QHCl-best (2.3), and MSG-best (4.1) were sluggish, but comparable with that reported previously. 3. The response breadth of the 82 neurons that responded best to either Sue, NaCl, HCl, or QHCl measured with the entropy coefficient indicated a moderate response breadth for these neurons (mean = 0.79; range = 0.30-0.98). According to the response criteria adopted in this experiment (water response +/- 1.96 SD), however, 81 of these 82 neurons (98.1%) responded to only one or two of the four basic taste stimuli. The disparity between the entropy- and criterion-based measures of response derive from the nature of the two statistics. Adjustments that would make the entropy statistic less inclusive and the definition of a response according to statistical criteria less exclusive would increase their concordance. 4. Three multivariate statistics (cluster, principal axis factor, and multidimensional analysis) were used to analyze the data. Cluster analysis enabled us to divide the 82 taste neurons into groups on the basis of response similarity. Each of the four largest groups was dominated by neurons that responded best to one of the four basic taste stimuli: Suc, NaCl, QHCl, and HCl (ranked in descending order); the fifth largest cluster contained neurons that responded best to MSG. Principal axis factor analysis demonstrated that 80.8% of the total variance could be accounted for by three factors. Neurons responding best to Suc, NaCl, and QHCl each were closely associated with one of those three factors, but the loadings of the HCl-best neurons were evenly distributed across all three factors. The communality coefficient of these three factors was > 80% for the Suc-, NaCl-, HCl-, and QHCl-best neurons; the MSG-best neurons, by comparison, had very few high loadings on any of these three factors and a correspondingly low communality coefficient of 40.4%, a difference that was statistically significant from the other four groups. Thus the three factors related to Suc-, NaCl-, HCl-, and QHCl-best neurons are not relevant to MSG-best neurons. We used multidimensional analysis to arrange the neurons that responded best to Suc, NaCl, HCl, QHCl, and MSG into five loosely arranged and partially overlapping clusters. A multidimensional space based on stimulus similarity showed that MSG was as different from the four basic taste stimuli as they were from one another. 5. Mixture suppression, a common observation in human psychophysical experiments, was examined at the neurophysiological level by including binary tastants in the stimulus battery. The average response of 19 Suc-best neurons to 1.0 M Suc (4.1 spikes/s) decreased to near 0 when the solvent was changed from DW to either 0.03 M MSG or 0.03 M NaCl. Similar decrements were observed in NaCl- and MSG-best neurons tested with Suc/NaCl mixtures. The addition of 0.03 M NaCl to 1.0 M Suc caused the across neuron profile of evoked activity to shift away from Suc and toward NaCl. The profile of the Suc/MSG mixture, on the other hand, resembled neither of the constituent stimuli. These data suggest that the Sue-salt mixtures underwent changes in both taste intensity and quality.",nan; HAMSTER PARABRACHIAL NEURONS; SUPERIOR LARYNGEAL NERVE; ALERT CYNOMOLGUS MONKEY; THALAMIC VPM NUCLEUS; AMINO-ACIDS; GUSTATORY RESPONSES; CITRIC-ACID; MONOSODIUM GLUTAMATE; MACAQUE MONKEYS; ORAL CAVITY

A clear distinction between cortico-subthalamic (hyperdirect) and cortico-tegmental projections (superolateral medial forebrain bundle, slMFB) so far is elusive. Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) of the slMFB (for major depression, MD and obsessive compulsive disorders, OCD) has on the one hand been interpreted as actually involving limbic (prefrontal) hyperdirect pathways. On the other hand slMFB's stimulation region in the mesencephalic ventral tegmentum is said to impact on other structures too, going beyond the antidepressant (or anti OCD) efficacy of sole modulation of the cortico-tegmental reward-associated pathways. We have here used a normative diffusion MRT template (HCP, n = 80) for long-range tractography and augmented this dataset with ex-vivo high resolution data (n = 1) in a stochastic brain space. We compared this data with histological information and used the high resolution ex-vivo data set to scrutinize the mesencephalic tegmentum for small fiber pathways present. Our work resolves an existing ambiguity between slMFB and prefrontal hyperdirect pathways which-for the first time-are described as co-existent. DBS of the slMFB does not appear to modulate prefrontal hyperdirect cortico-subthalamic but rather cortico-tegmental projections. Smaller fiber structures in the target region-as far as they can be discerned-appear not to be involved in slMFB DBS. Our work enfeebles previous anatomical criticism and strengthens the position of the slMFB DBS target for its use in MD and OCD.",dMRI; Deep brain stimulation; Hyperdirect pathways; Anterior limb of internal capsule; Major depression; Obsessive compulsive disorder; Superolateral medial forebrain bundle; MEDIAL FOREBRAIN-BUNDLE; DEEP BRAIN-STIMULATION; ANTERIOR THALAMIC RADIATION; HUMAN ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; PRIMARY MOTOR CORTEX; CORTICAL PROJECTIONS; REWARD CIRCUITRY; MACAQUE MONKEY; FRONTAL-LOBE; RAT

I. Areal organization,"We have examined the topography of the cerebral cortex of the Australian echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus), using Nissl and myelin staining, immunoreactivity for parvalbumin, calbindin, and nonphosphorylated neurofilament protein (SMI-32 antibody), and histochemistry for acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and NADPH diaphorase. Myelinated fibers terminating in layer IV of the cortex were abundant in the primary sensory cortical areas (areas S1, R, and PV of somatosensory cortex; primary visual cortex) as well as the frontal cortex. Parvalbumin immunoreactivity was particularly intense in the neuropil and somata of somatosensory regions (S1, R, and PV areas) but was poor in motor cortex. Immunoreactivity with the SMI-32 antibody was largely confined to a single sublayer of layer V pyramidal neurons in discrete subregions of the somatosensory, visual, and auditory cortices, as well as a large field in the frontal cortex (Fr1). Surprisingly, SMI-32 neurons were absent from the motor cortex. In AChE preparations, S1, R, V1, and A regions displayed intense reactivity in supragranular layers. Our findings indicate that there is substantial regional differentiation in the expanded frontal cortex of this monotreme. Although we agree with many of the boundaries identified by previous authors in this unusual mammal (Abbie [19401 J. Comp. Neurol. 72:429-467), we present an updated nomenclature for cortical areas that more accurately reflects findings from functional and chemoarchitectural studies.

In the mammalian cerebral cortex, excitatory neurons have been ascribed to one of two main dendritic morphologies, either pyramidal or stellate, which differ mainly on the extent of the apical dendrite. Developmental mechanisms regulating the emergence and refinement of dendritic morphologies have been studied for cortical pyramidal neurons, but little is known for spiny stellate neurons. Using biolistics to label single cells on acute brain slices of the ferret primary visual cortex, we show that neurons in layer 4 develop in a two-step process: initially, all neurons appear pyramidal, growing a prominent apical dendrite and few small basal dendrites. Later, a majority of these neurons show a change in the relative extent of basal and apical dendrites that results in a gradual sculpting into a stellate morphology. We also find that similar to 22% of neurons maintain the proportionality of their dendritic arbors, remaining as pyramidal cells at maturity. When ferrets were deprived of retinal input at early stages of postnatal development by binocular enucleation, a significant proportion of layer 4 spiny neurons failed to remodel their apical dendrites, and similar to 55% remained as pyramidal neurons. Our results demonstrate that cortical spiny stellate neurons emerge by differential sculpting of the dendritic arborizations of an initial pyramidal morphology and that sensory input plays a fundamental role in this process.",nan; MONKEY STRIATE CORTEX; THALAMIC RECIPIENT NEURONS; OCULAR DOMINANCE COLUMNS; SPINY STELLATE NEURONS; POSTNATAL-DEVELOPMENT; MACAQUE MONKEY; IN-VIVO; ANATOMICAL ORGANIZATION; PROJECTION NEURONS; CEREBRAL-CORTEX

We report that a novel pathway from the anterior cingulate cortex, an area which has a key role in attention, projects directly to the primary olfactory cortex in rhesus monkeys, innervating mostly the anterior olfactory nucleus. Axons from the anterior cingulate cortex formed synapses mostly with spines of putative excitatory pyramidal neurons and with a small proportion of a neurochemical class of inhibitory neurons that are thought to have disinhibitory effect on excitatory neurons. This novel pathway from the anterior cingulate is poised to exert a powerful excitatory effect on the anterior olfactory nucleus, which is a critical hub for odorant processing via extensive bilateral connections with primary olfactory cortices and the olfactory bulb. Acting on the anterior olfactory nucleus, the anterior cingulate may activate the entire primary olfactory cortex to mediate the process of rapid attention to olfactory stimuli.",Olfaction; Attention; Anterior cingulate cortex; Primary olfactory cortex; Anterior olfactory nucleus; Posterior orbitofrontal cortex; THALAMIC RETICULAR NUCLEUS; COMMISSURAL FIBER SYSTEMS; MONKEY PREFRONTAL CORTEX; RAT PIRIFORM CORTEX; OLD-WORLD MONKEY; ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; MACAQUE MONKEY; TOPOGRAPHIC ORGANIZATION; SYNAPTIC CONNECTIONS; SELECTIVE ATTENTION

In primates, the prefrontal cortex (PFC) has been thought to contribute to each of these processes; however, causal relationships between particular subdivisions of the PFC and specific functions have been difficult to establish.

Using a novel 2DG/immunostaining technique to double-label hamster barrel cortex for metabolism and phenotype, we have recently shown that while many GABAergic neurons are heavily 2DG labeled during normal exploratory behavior, a subset of GABAergic cells shows relatively sparse 2DG labeling. For this study we used the 2DG/immunostaining technique to test whether, in awake behaving animals, calcium-binding protein expression in a given cell in barrel cortex (as indicated by immunohistochemistry for PV or CA) was related to the degree of 2DG labeling. We found that most PVC cells were moderately to heavily 2DG labeled, while most CA+ cells were lightly 2DG labeled. Our data indicate that the PV+ and CA+ cells represent metabolically distinct subpopulations of GABAergic neurons in barrel cortex. This distinction corresponds well with the in vitro physiological and anatomical data from frontal cortex and suggests functional implications for the expression of PV and CA, or other colocalized factors, in normally functioning cortical circuitry.

Usually, the location and modality of the stimulus is represented by the location and specificity of the receptor and the intensity of the stimulus and its temporal modulation is thought to be encoded by the instantaneous firing rate. Recent studies have shown that, primarily in cortical structures, special features of a stimulus also are represented in the temporal pattern of spike activity. Typical attributes of this time structure are oscillatory patterns of activity and synchronous discharges in spatially distributed neurons that respond to inputs evoked by a coherent object. The origin and functional significance of this kind of activity is less clear. Cortical, subcortical and even very peripheral sources seem to be involved. Most of the relevant studies were devoted to the mammalian visual system and cortical findings on temporally structured activity were reviewed recently (Eckhorn, 1994, Progr. Brain Res., Vol. 102, pp. 405-426; Singer and Gray, 1995, Annu. Rev. Neurosci., Vol. 18, pp. 555-586). Therefore, this article is designed to give an overview, especially of those studies concerned with the temporal structure of visual activity in subcortical centers of the primary visual pathway, which are the retina and the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). We discuss the mechanisms that possibly contribute to the generation and modulation of the subcortical activity time structure and we try to relate to each other the subcortical and cortical patterns of sensory activity.

In the striatum, gradients of neuropil immunostaining define four major territories: The first (T1) includes all but the rostroventral half of the putamen and is characterized by enhanced matriceal PV and SMI-32 immunoreactivity (4). The second territory (T2) encompasses most part of the caudate nucleus (Cd) and rostral putamen (PuT), which show enhanced matriceal CB-ir. The third and fourth territories M and T4) comprise rostroventral parts of Cd and PuT characterized by complementary patch/matrix distributions of CB- and CR-ir, and the accumbens nucleus (Acb), respectively. The latter is separated into lateral (prominently enhanced in CB-ir) and medial (prominently enhanced in CR-ir) subdivisions. In the pallidum, parallel gradients also delimit four territories, T1 in the caudal half of external (GPe) and internal (GPi) divisions, characterized by enhanced PV- and SMI-32-ir; T2 in their rostral half, characterized by enhanced CB-ir; and T3 and T4 in their rostroventral pole and in the subpallidal area, respectively, both expressing CB- and CR-ir but with different intensities. The subthalamic nucleus (STh) shows contrasting patterns of dense PV-ir (sparing only the most medial part) and low CB-ir. Expression of CR-ir is relatively low, except in the medial, low PV-ir, part of the nucleus, whereas SMI-32-ir is moderate across the whole nucleus, The substantia nigra is characterized by complementary patterns of high neuropil CB- and SMI-32-ir in pars reticulata (SNr and high CR-ir in pars compacta (SNc) and in the ventral tegmental area (VTA). The compartmentalization of calcium-binding proteins and SMI-32 in the human basal ganglia, in particular in the striatum and pallidum, delimits anatomofunctional territories that are of significance for functional imaging studies and target selection in stereotactic neurosurgery.

Numerous signatures of attention have been identified throughout the brain, and now experimenters are seeking to determine which of these signatures are causally related to the behavioral benefits of attention, and the source of these modulations within the brain. Here, we review the neural signatures of attention throughout the brain, their theoretical benefits for visual processing, and their experimental correlations with behavioral performance. We discuss the importance of measuring cue benefits as a way to distinguish between impairments on an attention task, which may instead be visual or motor impairments, and true attentional deficits. We examine evidence for various areas proposed as sources of attentional modulation within the brain, with a focus on the prefrontal cortex. Lastly, we look at studies that aim to link sources of attention to its neuronal signatures elsewhere in the brain.

If development is tied to time since conception, preterm infants should match the developmental trajectories of fullterm infants when plotted in postterm age. By contrast, if development is influenced by visual experience, preterm and fullterm infants should match when plotted in postnatal age. Luminance (light/dark) and chromatic (red/green) contrast sensitivities (CS) were measured in 25 preterm (born, on average, 6.6 weeks early) and 77 fullterm infants, between 1 and 6 months postterm. In the first few months, luminance CS was found to be predicted by postterm age, suggesting that preprogrammed development is sufficient to account for luminance CS. By contrast, chromatic CS exceeded that predicted by postterm age, which suggests that time since birth confers a bene fit on chromatic CS. The preterms' 6.6 weeks of additional time since birth is roughly equivalent to 3.7 weeks of development in chromatic CS. In sum, these results suggest that chromatic CS is more influenced by early postnatal visual experience than luminance CS, which may have implications for development of parvocellular and magnocellular pathways.",infant vision; preterm; premature; contrast sensitivity; luminance; chromatic; LOW-BIRTH-WEIGHT; LATERAL GENICULATE-NUCLEUS; VISUAL-EVOKED-POTENTIALS; MONKEYS MACACA-NEMESTRINA; EARLY UNILATERAL BLUR; TEMPORAL-MODULATION SENSITIVITY; THALAMIC RECIPIENT NEURONS; SPINY STELLATE NEURONS; PATTERN REVERSAL VEP; POSTNATAL-DEVELOPMENT

We have used SMI-32, a monoclonal antibody that recognizes a nonphosphorylated epitope on the medium- and high-molecular-weight subunits of neurofilament proteins. This antibody labels primarily the cell body and dendrites of pyramidal neurons in cortical layers III, V, and VI. Neurofilament protein-immunoreactive neurons were prominent in 20 visual cortical areas (areas 17, 18, 19, 20a, 20b, 21a, 21b, and 7; posteromedial lateral, posterolateral lateral, anteromedial lateral, anterolateral lateral, dorsal lateral, ventral lateral, and posterior suprasylvian areas; anterior ectosylvian, the splenial, the cingulate, and insular visual areas; and the anterolateral gyrus area). In addition, we have also found strong immunopositive cells in the A laminae of the dorsal part of the lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and in the medial interlaminar nucleus, but no immunoreactive cells were present in the parvocellular C (1-3) laminae of the dLGN, in the ventral part of the LGN and in the perigeniculate nucleus. This SMI-32 antibody against neurofilament protein revealed a characteristic pattern of immunostaining in each visual area. The size, shape, intensity, and density of neurofilament protein-immunoreactive neurons and their dendritic arborization differed substantially across all visual areas. Moreover, it was also obvious that several visual areas showed differences in laminar distribution and that such profiles may be used to delineate various cortical areas. Therefore, the expression of neurofilament protein can be used as a specific marker to define areal patterns and topographic boundaries in the cat visual system.
