Five percent wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGAHRP) in sterile saline was pressure injected into the cuneate nucleus using a Hamilton syringe onto which was attached a micropipette with a tip diameter of 40-50 pm. Injections were placed approximately 2 mm apart and each injection consisted of 0.02-0.04 ~1 in volume the total volume injected being approximately 0.1 ~1. In the seven animals used for spinothalamic projections the cervical (n = 4) or the lumbar (n = 3) enlargement of the spinal cord was surgically exposed after a laminectomy and 5% WGA-HRP was pressure injected into the dorsal horn of the cord medial to the dorsal root entry zone. Iniections were placed approximately 2 mm apart rostrocaudally and eachinjection was 0.024.04 ~1 in volume the total volume iniected over the enlareement being approximately 0.14 ~1 labeling about two or three cons&utive spinal segments. The injections labeled extensive regions of the dorsal and ventral horn gray matter (see Fig. The brain and spinal cord were removed and the thalamus was blocked in the stereotaxic plane (Olszewski 1952) and the injected segments of the medulla and cord cut into transverse blocks. The injection sites and the thalamus were serially sectioned with a Vibratome at 100 pm thickness. For light microscopy cord medulla and thalamus sections were mounted on slides in serial order to determine the extent of the injection and projection sites respectively. Results Light microscopy We examined the WGA-HRP transport to VPLc following microinjections of the tracer into the contralateral cuneate nucleus or cervical or lumbar enlargements. Spinal injections resulted in discrete clusters of terminal axonal arbors in the somatotopically appropriate region of the VPLc nucleus of the thalamus upper extremity representation being medial to that of the lower extremity. Three-dimensional reconstructions of ML or STT afferents reveal that a given segment of the relay cell dendritic arbor receives labeled terminals from one or the other source; for instance RL profiles contacting a particular dendritic segment are labeled after dorsal column nuclei injection or after spinal cord injection respectively. All terminals contacting this segment of dendrite were labeled after WGA-HRP injections into the spinal cord. Not all terminal profiles contained label in this series which may be attributed to the extent of the spinal cord injection.""",

Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) experiments In eight animals injections of a solution containing 8% HRP conjugated to wheat germ agglutinin (Sigma) were made with a microsyringe (Hamilton 5 p1) mounted on a microdrive. Small amounts (0.05 ~1) of the injectate were delivered 1.5 mm below the pial surface at each of two adjacent sites separated by 1-2 mm over a 30-minute period. HRP was injected in orbital areas 11 and 12 lateral area 12 and ventral area 46 (cases 1-4). In addition injections were placed in areas within the mediodorsal prefrontal sector: medial area 32 (case 5) dorsal area 46 (case 71 and dorsal area 8 (cases 8 and 9). Composite of injection sites shown on the medial (A) lateral (B) and basal (C) surfaces of the cerebral hemisphere. The injection sites are superimposed on an architectonic map of the prefrontal cortex (Barbas and Pandya '89). Fluorescent tracer experiment With the surgical procedures outlined above one animal received an injection of the fluorescent tracer fast blue (3% 0.4 pl) in medial area 14 (case 6). Outlines of brain sections the location of retrogradely labeled neurons ipsilateral to the injection site and the site of blood vessels used as landmarks were transferred from the slides onto paper by using an X-Y recorder (Hewlett Packard 7044B) which was electronically coupled to the stage of the microscope. The size of the injection site and histochemical variables inadvertently differ from case to case. Anatomic definition of injection sites The cortical areas containing the injection sites were reconstructed serially using the sulci as landmarks and are shown on diagrams of the surface of the cortex. They are illustrated in diagrams of coronal sections through the injection site in the previous study (Barbas '88; see Figs. Figure 10F shows the injection site in area 8 in case 8; the boundaries of area 8 are shown in a matched section stained with thionin in Figure 10G. In case 6 not hitherto described the extent of the injection site of fast blue was plotted from coronal sections which were then counterstained with cresyl violet and returned to the microscope to determine architectonic borders (see Fig. On the basal and lateral surfaces the injections were in architectonic areas designated by the same numbers by Walker ('40b); on the medial surface our map corresponds more closely to that of Brodmann ('05). The injections were in four basoventral (area 11 case 1; orbital 12 case 2; lateral 12 case 3; ventral area 46 case 41 and five mediodorsal (area 32 case 5; area 14 case 6; dorsal 46 case 7; dorsal area 8 cases 8-9) prefrontal areas. Eight of the cases appeared in previous studies on cortical projections as described above (see Anatomic definition of injection site). The relationship of the injection sites to architectonic areas of the prefrontal cortex is shown in Figure 1.

Only when injections encroached on the lateral belt cortex were substantial numbers of labeled neurons found in the ventral (MGv) division of the MGC consistent with the absence of significant connections between the parabelt and core fields. By placing injections of different distinguishable tracers in rows along the rostrocaudal extent of the parabelt region we could determine whether the parabelt region defined as auditory by inputs from the belt also receives auditory inputs from the thalamus. MATERIALS AND METHODS In five macaque monkeys (three M. mulatta three M. nemestrina) microinjections of four to seven anatomical tracers were made at equal intervals along the dorsal superior temporal gyrus within 3 mm of the lateral sulcus in the left hemisphere. The procedures for making tracer injections and evaluating their locations have been described in detail in our previous paper on cortical connections based on the same cases (Hackett et al. The postinjection survival period was 7 days when WGA-HRP was used (three cases) and 12 days when only fluorescent tracers were injected (two cases).

This cell was typical of the large cells found in the lateral and central PM which were not labeled by our parabelt injections. The large cells in the medial PM were frequently labeled by injections of the parabelt. Thalamic connections of the parabelt auditory cortex The thalamocortical connections of the parabelt auditory cortex were determined by injecting retrograde tracers into the superior temporal gyrus near the ventral lip of the lateral sulcus (Fig. Cell labeling in the MGv was nearly absent when tracer injections were limited to the parabelt and did not involve the cortex of the lateral belt on the superior temporal plane. In case 9552 the FB (open triangles) WGA-HRP (filled squares) and DY (open squares) injections involved both the parabelt and the lateral belt adjacent to AI (Fig. In the thalamus these injections resulted in substantial cell labeling in the MGv (Fig. In the same case labeled cells associated with these three injections were also found dorsal to the MGd in a region corresponding in location to the posterior nucleus (Po). Connections of the dorsal medial geniculate nuclei (MGpd and MGad) exhibited a rostrocaudal topography with the parabelt that is rostral injections of the STG tended to label cells posteriorly and caudal injections labeled cells anteriorly in the MGd. 6) restriction of the parabelt injections to the rostral half of the STG resulted in topographic labeling in the posterior MGd corresponding to MGpd whereas the MGad was virtually devoid of labeled cells. The large cells in the central PM were not labeled by parabelt injections and were larger than those in the medial PM which were sometimes labeled by parabelt injections. 4 sections 111 and 121) labeled cells were distributed in patches that were often segregated from cells labeled by other injections. Furthermore as in case 9464 section 111 labeled cells associated with the same injection were sometimes segregated into groups. In the rostral third of the MGm fewer numbers of labeled cells were found and these were usually associated with the most caudal injection sites. The patches of labeled cells sometimes reflected the rostrocaudal sequence of injections in the cortex but more often the patches contained labeled cells associated with the same injection indicating that separate zones in the MGm project in parallel to the same location in cortex. 4) cells labeled by rostral and caudal parabelt injections overlapped in sections 111 and 121 with little evidence of segregation. In case 961 cells labeled by the most rostral and most caudal injections overlapped in the most posterior section analyzed (Fig. In case 9552 the distribution of labeled cells appeared to be slightly more patchy than in the other cases and even cells labeled by closely spaced injections were segregated (Fig. Note that the three most caudal injections in this case also involved the cortex of the lateral belt but it is unclear whether this contributed significantly to the greater segregation. In case 9464 only one labeled cell was found in the MGm that was associated with the Fast Blue injection (Fig. This injection made in area Tpt (Pandya and Sanides 1973) caudal to the parabelt was the most caudal injection made in the five cases analyzed for this study and labeled many cells in the PM PL and Sg/Lim. The distribution of cells in the cortex labeled by this injection was also unique virtually circumscribing the caudal belt areas (Hackett et al. It was common to find cells in the MGm that were double-labeled by closely spaced injections. Figure 8 shows a cell in the MGm (case 961) double labeled by injections of FR (Fig. The injections were placed about 4 mm apart in the parabelt lateral to R (Fig. 4) numerous cells labeled by the rostral DY injection (filled circles) were found in posterior sections containing the Sg/Lim (sections 111 121 and 131). Anteriorly a mixed population of cells labeled by rostral and caudal injection sites was found but the number of cells labeled by the rostral injection was reduced (e.g. 5) in which only labeled cells associated with the most caudal injections were found in the anterior Sg/Lim. 6) very few cells in the Lim were labeled by the three most rostral injection sites (filled symbols) and apparently none in the Sg. This contrasts sharply with the relatively dense cell labeling in the PM and MGC associated with these injections. In contrast the number of labeled cells in the Sg/Lim was much greater for the other more caudal injections in this case (open symbols). These injections were positioned lateral to the rostral subdivision (R) of the auditory core whereas the three rostral injections were placed beyond the rostral border of R. In case 9552 (Fig. In posterior sections labeled cells from only the most rostral parabelt injections occupied the extreme ventromedial portion of the medial Fig. Dorsorostral view of the left macaque superior temporal region showing the major regions of the auditory cortex (core medial/ lateral belt parabelt) and locations of injection sites for each case.

In more anterior sections the distribution of labeled cells spread dorsally and laterally involving cells labeled by the more caudal parabelt injections. Labeled cells associated with widely spaced injection sites along the rostrocaudal axis of the parabelt tended to remain segregated in the medial pulvinar whereas closely spaced injection sites resulted in overlapping distributions. Typically cells labeled by caudal injection sites occupied positions dorsal and lateral to cells labeled by rostral injections. 6) labeled cells associated with the most rostral injection (FB filled circles) were clearly segregated from cells associated with the three most caudal injections in PM. The DY (open squares) and FR (open triangles) injection sites which were particularly close together yielded very similar distributions of labeled cells some of which were labeled by both tracers (i.e. In contrast double-labeled cells associated with more widely spaced injection sites were not observed in PM. The overlapping distribution of cells often observed in the central PM tended to be associated with injections in the caudal parabelt whereas rostral parabelt injections labeled cells nearer the medial and dorsal edge of the PM. In many sections large scattered cells labeled by the most rostral injection sites were found along the extreme dorsomedial edge of PM coextensive with the narrow band of intense calbindin immunoreactivity described above (e.g. Cells labeled by more caudal injections occupied relatively ventral and lateral positions in medial PM. Projections from the ventral nucleus (MGv) were only observed when the cortex of the lateral belt was involved in the injection; thus the MGv does not appear to be significantly connected with the parabelt. In the present study the thalamocortical connections of the parabelt region were examined by placing injections of several retrograde tracers into the dorsal half of the STG within 35 mm of the lateral sulcus. A topographic pattern of connections was reflected in these projections such that rostral parabelt injections labeled more caudal Fig. Projections from the MGv were observed only when the cortex of the lateral belt was involved in the tracer injection. The involvement of the belt cortex by the injection was associated with the appearance of labeled cells in the auditory core which is unlabeled after injections restricted to the parabelt (Hackett et al. Although the thalamocortical connections of the parabelt region have not been systematically studied previously tracer injections in the superior temporal gyrus have not revealed significant connections with the MGv (Pandya et al. Only when these injections appeared to encroach on the lateral belt or core were labeled cells found in the MGv (Fitzpatrick and Imig 1978; Morel and Kaas 1992; Morel et al. Likewise when lesions or injections of the thalamus are restricted to the MGv degenerated terminals or labeled cells are limited to the areas in and around the core on the superior temporal plane (Pandya and Sanides 1973; Mesulam and Pandya 1973; Burton and Jones 1976; Hashikawa et al. In our material labeled cells were found in the MGm after all parabelt injections. For example rostral parabelt injections tended to label the caudal MGm and vice versa but distributions of labeled cells from the rostral and caudal parabelt sometimes overlapped in patches usually midway between the rostral and caudal thirds of the nucleus. Conversely even labeled cells associated with adjacent injections were segregated in patches usually in the dorsoventral dimension. Based on the sizes and depths of our injections it is likely that both populations of cells were labeled in the MGm possibly accounting for the complex pattern of connections. An additional observation gleaned from the present study was that numerous labeled cells were found in the MGm after all parabelt injections but not after a single injection in Tpt (open squares case 9464) which labeled cells in the Sg/Lim and pulvinar. For example after a large isotope injection in Tpt possibly limited to the exposed surface of the STG labeled terminals were found in the pulvinar suprageniculate and MGd but not the MGm or MGv (Pandya et al. However when the adjacent area paAc just medial to Tpt on the superior temporal plane was involved by injections of Tpt in other cases labeled terminals were then found in the MGm. Furthermore injections in the areas immediately rostral to Tpt corresponding to the parabelt region (i.e. Injections of the rostral parabelt labeled cells posteriorly in the MGpd whereas injections of the caudal parabelt labeled cells anteriorly primarily in the MGad. Thus injections in the parabelt caudal to lateral extension of the AI/R border tend to label cells in the caudal belt and caudal parabelt whereas STG injections rostral to the border of AI and R tend to label cells in the rostral belt and parabelt (Hackett et al. (1995) injections of retrograde tracers were made in the rostral and caudal portions of the lateral belt region. Although no injections were placed in the medial belt it was clear that the MGad projected more strongly to the lateral auditory belt caudal to the border of AI and R whereas the MGpd projected to the lateral belt cortex rostral to that border. In our material most of the injections into the parabelt labeled cells in the Sg/Lim. Burton and Jones (1976) found topographically organized labeling in the granular insula following isotope injections restricted to the Sg and Sg/Lim complex in rhesus and squirrel monkeys. In their material label was found in the lateral sulcus and caudal STG only when an injection involved the MGC. (1989) found anterograde and retrograde labeling associated with injections of WGA-HRP into AI as well as cells labeled retrogradely by fluorescent tracers. In owl monkeys injections of tracers into AI and R of the core produced retrogradely labeled cells in the Sg (Fitzpatrick and Imig 1978; Morel and Kaas 1992) although injections restricted to R were associated with much sparser labeling compared with AI. Morel and Kaas (1992) also found labeled cells in the owl monkey Sg associated with injections into the lateral belt and rostral superior temporal gyrus. (1993) in M. fascicularis although labeling in the Sg appeared to be heavier following injection of the lateral belt compared with AI. (1995) except that they made no injections into the STG. In rats Kurokawa and Saito (1995) found that a population of smaller neurons in the Sg projected to premotor frontal cortex whereas the overlapping population of larger cells was retrogradely labeled by injections in the auditory association cortex of the temporal lobe (i.e. Following parabelt injections cell labeling in the PM tended to overlap with regions of darker immunoreactivity for calbindin. Rostral injections in the auditory parabelt tended to label cells along the medial edge of the PM whereas more caudal injections revealed connections dorsally and laterally but typically not more lateral than the central third of the nucleus; thus the projections to the parabelt originated in the medial and central PM but not the lateral PM. In their material rostral injections into the dorsal bank of the STS labeled cells in the medial PM (cases 1 and 2) whereas more caudally placed injections in the dorsal bank of the STS resulted in labeling in the central/lateral PM as well as PL (cases 38).""",

The results showed that each of these areas receives afferents from a set of thalamic nuclei and that this set differs qualitatively and quantitatively according to the injected area. All of the injected areas receive a strong projection from the medial dorsal nucleus (MD). Although there are several reports in the literature concerning the thalamic input to superior or mesial area 6 in most of them no systematic attempt was made to correlate the location of the injection sites with anatomically or physiologically well-defined areas (Kievit and Kuypers 1977; Miyata and Sasaki 1983 1984; Schell and Strick 1984; GoldmanRakic and Porrino 1985; Ilinsky et al. In addition in the few studies in which the physiological properties of the injected areas (SEF: Huerta and Kaas 1990; Shook et al. However in both of the abovementioned studies the locations of the injection sites were not correlated with architectonical or physiological data. More recently injections of tracers were made into F3 (SMA-proper) following physiological definition by Rouiller et al. In the present study injections of tracers into F3 and F6 were made after physiological identification of the two areas and the locations of the injections were correlated with their cytoarchitectonic boundaries. In addition the number and percentage of retrogradely labeled cells in each thalamic nucleus were determined in order to assess the exact contribution of each nucleus to the injected area. In all animals retrograde transport of neuronal tracers injected into the cortex was used to define the origin of thalamic input to mesial and superior area 6. In all animals but one (case lo) the injections of tracers were made following electrophysiological identification with intracortical microstimulation of the injected sites. Table 1 summarizes the monkey species the physiological procedure employed and the body movements evoked at the injection sites. In case 10 the injection sites in F2 were chosen by using the superior precentral sulcus as an anatomical landmark on the basis of previous physiological studies (Weinrich and Wise 1982; Kurata 1989; Godschalk et al. Tracer injections and histological procedures Once the appropriate cortical site was chosen wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP; 4% in distilled water) fast blue (FB; 3% in distilled water) true blue (TB; 5% in distilled water) or diamidino yellow (DY 2% in 0.2 M phosphate buffer pH 7.2) was slowly pressure injected through a glass micropipette (tip diameter 50-100 km) attached to a 1 pl Hamilton microsyringe. Table 2 summarizes the locations of the injections the injected tracers and their amounts. The tracers injected into the medial cortical convexity were delivered at 1.5 mm below the pial surface. Those injected into the mesial cortex were delivered at different depths from the cortical crown; the locations were based on the electrophysiological results. Following each injection the dural flap was sutured the bone was replaced and the superficial tissues were sutured in layers. After survival periods of 2 days following WGA-HRP injections and of 12-14 days following fluorescent tracer injections each animal was anesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride (15 mg/kg i.m.) followed by an intravenous lethal injection of sodium thiopental and was perfused through the left cardiac ventricle by one of the following fixation procedures: 1) the fixation procedure described by Mesulam (1982; cases 3 and 9); 2) 0.9% sodium chloride 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.4 10% sucrose and 1.5% dimethyl sulfoxide in the same buffer (cases 1 2 and 4); or 3) 0.9% sodium chloride 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 7.4 5% glycerol in the same buffer (case 10; Rosene et al. The extent of each WGA-HRP injection site was taken to be the densely stained region adjacent to the needle track and the surrounding halo. Each dye injection site had two concentric zones: 1) an inner zone which was sharply delineated around the needle track that appeared necrotic and intensely fluorescent; and 2) a second less sharply delineated zone that was less brilliantly fluorescent. The outer border of the second zone was considered to be the border of the injection. To determine the locations of the injection sites Nissl and cytochrome-oxidase-stained material was used to identify the various areas of the agranular frontal cortex following the criteria defined by Matelli et al. The borders between the different areas and the extent of the injection sites were then plotted on individual section drawings and were mapped onto an unfolded view of the cortical surface of the hemisphere. The stimulation sites were plotted on unfolded views of the cortical surfaces and the stimulation maps were then superimposed on the cytoarchitectonic maps and correlated with the locations of the injection sites. In all cases and for all tracer injections the thalamic labeling was quantified by counting all of the marked neurons in each plotted section and by determining the total number and percentage of labelled neurons in all thalamic nuclei. differences in tracer sensitivity differences in the amount and spread of the used tracer differences in the laminar cortical involvement if mesial vs. dorsolateral convexity injections are compared) may account for the differences observed among the various cases in the total number of labeled neurons. Despite this variability the percentage distributions of the labeling observed for injections of different tracers into the same area were almost similar.

The extent of the injection site (black area) plotted onto the flattened dorsal and mesial view of the hemisphere is shown on the upper left. The locations of the injection sites and the thalamic distribution of the marked cells with the two tracers are illustrated in Figure 6. Following injections into the leg field TB-labeled neurons were found laterally whereas following injections into the arm field DY-labeled neurons were found centrally in these nuclei. The values represent the mean values of all F3 injections. Motor thalamus projections to F6 (pre-SMA) Three injections of tracers were made in F6 in two monkeys. In case 4 (left hemisphere) an injection of DY was made into the rostral part of F6. The location of the injection site and the distribution of the labeled cells in selected thalamic levels are shown in Figure 8. The thalamic labeling was markedly different from that observed following injections in F3. In the right hemisphere of case 4 an injection of FB was made into the caudal part of F6. The location of the injection and the results obtained are shown in Figure 9 and the quantitative data are shown in Table 3. Figure 10 illustrates the results obtained following an injection of FB into the caudal and dorsal edge of F6 just rostral to the F6-F3 cytoarchitectonic border. One can see from the figure and from Table 3 that the distribution of the labeling was substantially the same as that observed in the two other injections into F6 the only difference being a more dense labeling in VApc. Motor thalamus projections to F2 Two injections of fluorescent tracers were made into the caudal part of F2 in case 10 one medial (TB) and one lateral (FB) to the superior precentral sulcus (Fig. According to previous physiological data the medial injection site should correspond to F2 leg field whereas the lateral injection should corresponds to the arm field (Weinrich and 10969861 1996 1 Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1096-9861(19960812)372:1<59::AID-CNE6>3.0.CO;2-L by Rwth Aachen Hochschulbibliothe Wiley Online Library on [12/09/2023].

The extent of the injection sites is shown on the upper left. Following both injections the heaviest labeling was found in the VPLoIVLc complex. Dense labeling was found also in VLc following the medial injection and in VPLo following the lateral injection. Some labeling was found in VLo and in the case of the lateral injection in VLm. Motor thalamus projections to F7 Two tracer injections were made into the dorsal part of F7 in two monkeys. The location of the injection site and the distribution of the thalamic labeling of case 9 (WGA-HRP) are illustrated in Figure 12. Note that the labeling of VAmc is a peculiar characteristic of the thalamic projections to the dorsal part of F7 and was not found following injections into the other areas forming the superior and mesial sectors of area 6. Figure 13 shows the results of the second monkey in which dorsal F7 was injected (case 2 FB). One tracer injection (case 2 DY) was made into the ventral part of F7. A microelectrode exploration of F7 which was made before the injection showed that unlike dorsal F7 no eye movements could be evoked from this part of F7. The results of the tracer injection experiment are illustrated in Figure 14. A comparison between dorsal and ventral F7 injections (compare Figs. The location of labeling within MD varied although with some overlap following injections into the different areas of the agranular frontal cortex and it did not respect strictly the cytoarchitectonic boundaries of MD subdivisions according to Olszewski (1952). The rostrocaudal extent of the Iabeling observed following injections into F2 (case 10) was similar to that following injection into F3 (AP +6.0 to +3.0). The two territories partially overlapped in the ventral and caudal parts of MD whereas more rostrally the labeling following F2 injections was located more dorsally and laterally than the labeling seen following F3 injection. DISCUSSION General organization of thalamocortical projections to the agranular frontal cortex In the first systematic study of the thalamocortical projections to the frontal agranular cortex made with neuronal tracers Kievit and Kuypers (1977) reported that tracer injections made into a given cortical region produced a retrograde labeling in the thalamus that was organized in longitudinal bands extending across several thalamic nuclei. However because of the large extent of the injection sites the possibility remained that more restricted injections could produce labeling in a single thalamic nucleus. Indeed a different model of thalamocortical connectivity was proposed by Schell and Strick (1984) on the basis of a series of injections made into area 4 SMA and postarcuate cortex. Distribution of retrogradely labeled thalamic neurons following FB and TB injections into the arm and leg representations of F2 respectively in a series of selected coronal sections. The extent of the injection sites is shown on the upper left. This point of view was not confirmed by a number of subsequent studies which demonstrated that restricted injections of tracers made into different parts of the agranular frontal cortex produced labeling in several thalamic nuclei (Miyata and Sasaki 1984; Goldman-Rakic and Porrino 1985; Ilinsky et al. Unfortunately in most of these studies no attempt was made to correlate the location of the injection site with architectonical and/or physiological properties of the injected area. Exceptions to this are some more recent studies in which tracer injections were made under physiological control into inferior area 6 and area4 (Matelliet al. The results of all these studies show that each injected area and even a single somatotopic field within a given area receive thalamocortical projections from a multiplicity of thalamic nuclei although in different proportion. Following injections into F3 (SMA-proper) the most heavily labeled nucleus is VLo. The percentage of labeling found in this nucleus varied from 21.2 to 30.7 in the different cases (mean value 25.6%) and it was very similar for arm and leg field injections (30.7 vs. 27.7% respectively). (1995) in which the arm field of F3 was injected. Evidence in favor of a multiplicity of sources of the thalamic input to F3 can be found in other studies in which although no distinction was made between F3 and F6 it is possible to attribute the location of the injection to F3 only. This appears to be the case for the injections into the caudal portion of mesial area 6 of the study of Wiesendanger and Wiesendanger (1985a) and of the SMA injection of Darian Smith et al. Following injections into F6 the set of labeled thalamic nuclei is markedly different from that projecting to F3. The percentage of labeling in VApc is much higher than that seen following injections into F3. In addition MD is much more heavily labeled following F6 than following F3 injections. Because SMA was classically considered to be coextensive with the whole extent of mesial area 6 it is difficult to find reports in the literature of tracer injections that can be attributed to F6 only (most of them involved both F3 and F6). However in the case of the SMA injection reported by Miyata and Sasaki (1984) the injection site appears to be located well in front of the AP level of the genu of the arcuate sulcus; thus presumably it is into F6. Those authors reported that injections made caudally (presumably in F3) produced labeling mostly in VLo and VLc whereas injections made rostrally (presumably in F6) produced labeling mostly in VApc area X and VLc. Finally injections made into the middle one-third of mesial area 6 produced labeling mainly in VLo and VLc but also in VApc and area X.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License 80 present data indicate that this gradual shift is only apparent and is probably due to involvement of both F3 and F6 in their middle injections. The abrupt change in the thalamic connectivity as one moves from F3 to F6 is very clear if one compares the results of case 1 in which the injection made into the arm field of F3 and the injection made into the caudal part of F6 although they were very close anatomically produced a markedly different distribution of labeling in the thalamus. (1990) the injections that are classified as being located in area 6aa instead appear to be located rostrally probably in F7. (1993) following their 6DC injections in addition to observing labeling in VLc also observed labeling in area X and VApc. However the location of the injection shown in their Figure 2 appears to be rostral with respect to that of the present study so that the labeling in VApc and in area X could be due to an involvement of F7 or to a difference in the thalamic input to the part of F2 closer to the arcuate sulcus. In a recent study Inase and Tanji (1994) injected F2 in a location similar to our FB injection of case 10 and the described location of the labeling in the ventrolateral thalamus was also similar with the exception that the rostralmost part of the labeling was attributed by those authors to VApc. Although our injections into F2 were not made under physiological control we used the superior precentral sulcus as a useful marker in order to inject the cortical sector where a number of authors have described the presence of set-related activity which is one of the main physiological characteristics of this area (Weinrich and Wise 1982; Weinrich et al. Following injections into the part of the cortical region called the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) from which set-related activity was recorded Kurata (1994) observed labeling mainly in VLc and VLo but not in VApc and very little in area X. In agreement with these physiological findings the thalamic distribution of labeling observed following injection into ventral F7 was very M. MATELLI AND G. LUPPINO different from that in dorsal F7. Although these findings derive from one injection only a similar distribution of labeling in the motor thalamus was also observed by Nakano et al. (1993) in their dorsorostral area 6 injection by Darian Smith et al. (1990) in some of their 6aa injections that did not involve the SEF region in the area 6 injection (dorsorostral part) of Miyata and Sasaki (1983) and by Inase and Tanji (1994). Somatotopic organization in the motor thalamus In their classical study Kievit and Kuypers (1977) described a mediolateral topographical arrangement of the thalamic connectivity that was found to depend on the location of the injected region. This somatotopic organization is also found when similar somatotopic fields are injected in other agranular frontal areas to which VPLo send minor projections regardless of their topographic position on the cortex. In the present study for example injections into the arm fields of F3 and F2 produced labeling in the arm representation of VPLo whereas injections into the leg field of the same areas produced labeling in the corresponding representation in this nucleus. The lateral part of VLo contains labeled neurons following injections into the leg field of F3 (major projection) or of F2 (minor projection) whereas following injections into the arm field of the same areas the labeled VLo neurons are located more centrally in the nucleus. Previous reports have also shown that injections into the leg arm and face fields of F1 produce labeling in the lateral central and medial parts of VLo respectively (Kievit and Kuypers 1977; Matelli et al. 1991) produce labeling in the medial part of this nucleus whereas injections into F6 in which the arm is mostly represented or into the hand field of F5 (Matelli et al. Finally injections into the face field of F5 produce labeling in the lateralmost part of area X (Matelli et al. Area X was never found to be labeled following injections into leg fields of the various agranular areas. This possibility is supported by a study of Inase and Tanji (1994) in which pallidal efferents and retrograde labeling from injections into 6DC and 6DR (possibly F2 and ventral F7 respectively) were found to overlap in the rostral part of VLC. The rostral and lateral parts of substantia nigra have been found to be labeled also by transneuronal transport of viruses injected into FEF (Lynch et al. Several data pointing in this direction include: 1) The corticostriatal projections of F6 and of ventral F7 reach mainly the associative territory of striatum (Kunzle 1978 6D injections; Parthasarathy et al. 1991); and 4) in contrast the part of VApc that sends a minor projection to F3 does not appear to be labeled following injection into prefrontal cortex (Goldman-Rakic and Porrino 1985; Barbas et al. Furthermore on the basis of experiments in which the labeling obtained with transneuronal transport of WGA-HRP or viruses has been plotted in the cerebellar nuclei following injections into different cortical areas it appears that the organization of the cerebellar outflow could be even more complex. The rostral and dorsal parts of the dentate and the anterior interpositus were found to be transneuronally labeled following injections of WGA-HRP (Wiesendanger and Wiesendanger 1985b; Orioli and Strick 1989) in F1 and a similar distribution of the labeling was observed also following injection into the caudal part of mesial area 6 (F3; Wiesendanger and Wiesendanger 1985b). Labeling in more ventral and caudal parts of the dentate and in the posterior interpositus has been observed following injections into rostral mesial area 6 (probably F6; Wiesendanger and Wiesendanger 198513) or into the postarcuate cortex (Orioli and Strick 1989). The thalamic labeling in the cerebellar recipient thalamus following injections into F1 and F3 was found mainly in VPLo VLc and the VPLo/VLc complex whereas following injections into F6 and postarcuate cortex it was located mainly in the central part of area X. Recently the caudal parts of the dentate and posterior interpositus were found to be transneuronally labeled following injections of viruses into the FEF with a thalamic labeling in the medial part of area X in the lateral part of MD and in VA (Lynch et al. Finally with the same method it was shown that injections into area 46 produced labeling in the ventralmost parts of dentate and posterior interpositus (Middleton and Strick 1994) with a thalamic labeling in MD VApc and VLc. Given this anatomical complexity the issue of which of these inputs may reach the motor areas through MD may be clarified only with double-tracer experiments in which specific cortical areas and the subcortical structures are injected in the same animal.""",

thalamus,The functional parcellation of the motor thalamus of primates has suffered from serious historical and technical drawbacks which have led to extreme confusion This is a problem when thalamic stereotaxy is again being use clinically The cause usually imputed is the historical conflict between two main schools the Vogt and the Anglo-American Michigan which used different nomenclatures In fact the reasons are more profound and serious A combination of them led to an archaic rigid conception of the thalamic nucleus overexploitation of cytoarchitectonic technique comparative anatomy and cortical connections underexploitation of subcortical afferent territories recent misuse of these territories hesitations in the use of the VA-VL system and opposition between ventral relay and dorsal associative nuclei Previous and current parcellations and nomenclatures for the lateral region finally appeared inappropriate Before presenting a new parcellation and nomenclature for the lateral region we explain why we did not adopt one of most common or of recently proposed nomenclatures and were led to make our own This is established according to rational and historically grounded rules Precise definition of thalamic elements is provided A thalamic region is a gross topographic division corresponding to the former nuclei A territory is defined as the cerebral space filled by afferent endings from one source When having a distinct topography in a region a given territory makes a subregion For each of the studied motor territories a review was made of its known cortical projections The thalamic space where neurons project to a given cortical target constitutes a source space Topographical comparison of the sources spaces with territories reveals that there is often no coincidence between different afferent or efferent neuronal set spaces It appears that source spaces are coincident in the pallidal and nigral territories but not in the cerebellar territory where two topographically distinct source spaces could be distinguished A thalamic nucleus is defined as the intersection of a thalamocortical source space with one territory A rapid review of the general anatomy of the diencephalon is made The dorsal thalamus is divided into allo- and isothalamus the latter with bushy and microneurons The lateral region is isothalamic The motor thalamus makes the anterior part of the lateral region The present work aims to analyse the functional anatomy of the motor thalamus by using precise topography and three-dimensional analyses of the subcortical territories receiving from the cerebellar nuclei part II the medial nucleus of the pallidum part III and the pars reticulata and mixta of the substantia nigra part IV Large injections were used to obtain the maximal extent of each territory A major deficiency of previous studies was inadequate cartography Reliance on ventricular CA-CP landmarks observed by use of orthogonal teleradiography is mandatory A study was made of intra- and interspecific variations and their effect on stereotactic and cartographic precision in macaques All three subcortical motor afferent territories to the motor thalamus of macaques are examined in precise cartography with three dimensional reconstructions rotations and reslicing The motor thalamus is made up of three topographically distinct and separate territories cerebellar pallidal territory and nigral They cover the entire anterior part of the lateral region There is no polar subdivision without lower afferents in front of the pallidal and nigral territories and thus no reason for isolating a nucleus lateralis polaris or a polar VA The cerebellar territory is continuous and dense in front of the somesthetic nucleus and everywhere separate from it It has a complex three-dimensional shape strongly convex anteriorly Its caudal portion is dorsal to the spmesthetic nucleus In the lateral dimension it extends from the lateral region to the paralaminar region of the medial complex The cerebellar territory primarily dentate also contains islands of axons from the interposed and fastigial nuclei the vestibular nuclei and the spinothalamic tract It corresponds to at least five previously isolated cytoarchitectonic nuclei It cannot be seen as a single entity but contains distinct ventrolateral and a mediodorsal source spaces Its complex three-dimensional shape its particular intersection with different cytoarchitectonic nuclei and source spaces can be simplified into two nuclei nucleus lateralis intermedius lateralis LIL and nucleus intermedius mediodorsalis LIM The stereotacticians ventralis intermedius Vim is discussed at length Tremorosynchronous and kinesthetic neurons are essentially located ventrally and laterally The intrathalamic topography observed in human patients indicates that the stereotacticianss target where tremorosynchronous neurons are found is within lateral cerebellar territory receiving cerebellar afferents and projecting to the motor cortex The hypothesis that the nucleus interpositus could be particularly involved is presented The nucleus lateralis intermedius lateralis LIL of the present study is equivalent in macaques to the stereotacticians Vime subject to interspecific differences The pallidal territory is anterior to and separate from the cerebellar territory in the oral part of the lateral region It covers the whole ventrodorsal extent of the thalamus It is crescent shaped strongly curved in the anteroposterior dimension and ends dorsally over the cerebellar territory It is also curved in the mediolateral dimension following the lateral border of the thalamus The territorial border does not coincide with cytoarchitectonic borders The pallidal territory includes various cytoarchitectonic nuclei Only the cloud-like ventral oral part is easily recognizable on purely cytoarchitectonic criteria The others are cytoarchitectonically ill defined The pallidal territory may be delineated using calbindin immunostaining Other targets of the medial pallidum are the central centre-médian-parafascicular complex the pedunculo-pontine complex and the lateral habenula In relation to its afferent and efferent connections the pallidal thalamus seems to be made up of a single piece and could be considered as the lateral oral subregion or nucleus LO The nigrothalamic connection has been ignored for a long time and remains undervalued Precise topographic description shows that the nigral territory is much more extensive than usually thought It is located medial to the pallidal territory and as the most rostral of all three subcortical afferent territories is named nucleus lateralis rostralis LR Orally the nigral territory covers the whole ventrodorsal extent of the lateral region of the thalamus A posterior part ends ventrally and medially just in front of the central complex A topographically distinct amygdalar coterritory forms a subdivision named nucleus Lateralis Rostralis pars medialis LRM A posterodorsal part ends in the anterior paralaminar part of the medial complex in front of the cerebellar territory Islands of nigral terminations are observed within the medial nucleus Three dimensional studies and artificial reslicing shows a posteroanterior sequence of the lemniscal cerebellar pallidal and nigral territories The three motor territories extend over the whole ventrodorsal extent of the dorsal region There appears to be no opposition of ventral to dorsal nuclei Nuclei of the lateral region are thus given the first adjective Lateralis The second adjective is from the initial sequence devised by C Vogt caudalis-intermedius-oralis to which we add rostralis The lemniscal territory is named subregio Lateralis Caudalis with two pars nucleus Lateralis Caudalis Lateralis LCL and nucleus Lateralis Caudalis Medialis LCM cerebellar territory is named subregio Lateralis Intermedia with two nuclei nucleus Lateralis intermedius Lateralis LIL which is the main source to the motor cortex and nucleus Lateralis Intremedius Medialis LIM The pallidal territory is subregio or nucleus Lateralis Oralis LO The nigral territory is subregio or nucleus Lateralis Rostralis LR with a particular pars made by the amygdalar coterritory LRM An atlas of the macaque motor thalamus comprising twelve levels is presented with mean dimensions for Macaca mulatta Boundaries are not primarily cytoarchitectonic but topographic territories and sources spaces This produces a modified parcellation of the macaque thalamus Each level is described and compared

Three Macaca two Macaca fascicularis (MI 32 MI 44 D) and one Macaca mulatta (MM 22) received intracerebellar injections of mixed [3H]leucine and [3 H]proline. The experimental study of the pallidal territory was based on the results of injections in seven adult macaques of both sexes. Five Macaca fascicularis (MI27 MI28 MI30 MI33 MI40) received pallidal injections of tritiated tracers. Two Macaca mulatta (MM21D and MM22D) received pallidal injections of WGA-HRP. The data from three macaques that received intrathalamic injections (MI24 MI36 and MS16) already used in previous works from the laboratory [96106] were reanalysed. The cartography of the nigral territory was drawn from 11 macaques: five Macaca fascicularis (MI22 MI27 MI31 MI35 MI41) and one Macaca mulatta (MM18) received nigral injections of tritiated tracers. Four Macaca mulatta (MM19 MM21 MM22G MM23G) and one Macaca fascicularis (MI43) received nigral injections of WGA-HRP. MM27 received one injection of Biocytin and one of WGA-HRP. Intrastriatal injections were performed on four macaques: three Macaca fascicularis and one Macaca arctoides. All other monkeys received stereotactic injections. The markers and the injected quantities were as follows. The volume of the cerebellar injections within the cerebellar nuclei was 0.3 or 0.4 ~1 of mixed [3H]leucine and -proline. The volumes of the pallidal injections were 0.3 or 0.4 ~zl of mixed [3H]leucine and -proline and 0.3 p~l of WGA-HRP. The volume of the thalamic injection ranged from 0.2 to 0.6 ~1 of WGA-HRP as a 10% solution in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) 0.01 M; pH 7.4. The volume of the nigral injections was of 0 3 or 0.4 ~1 of mixed [3H]leucine and -proline or ranged from 0.2 to 0.6 ~1 of WGA-HRP as a 10% solution in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) 0.01 M; pH 7.4. The duration of each injection was 10-20 min. After each injection the canula was left in place for a further 10-15 min. Our cerebellar injections were made in relation to another ventricular system of coordinates visualized by ventriculography relying on the fastigial point F located at the top of the 4th ventricle [1293]. The location in the brain was each time verified after the intracerebral trajectory and before any injection. Lower part: the Cartesian system of ventricular coordinates used for stereotaxic placements of injections and for cartography of the thalamus. Lesion and injection sites in the cerebellum The lesion sites involved the whole posterior part of the cerebellum the cerebellar nuclei and the white matter leaving only an anterior wall of cerebellar cortex (see [276] Fig. The injection site in MI32 and MI44 located in the hilum of the dentate nucleus involved the totality of the dentate and interposed nuclei and the lateral part of the fastigial nu- cleus. The injection site of MM 22 was essentially located within the fastigial nucleus bilaterally. Intrathalamic topography The intrathalamic distribution of the cerebellar axonal endings was identical in the lesioned and the injected monkeys. Source of the cerebellothalamic connection One retrograde study showed that the source of cerebel- lothalamic axons was located in all cerebellar nuclei [353] even though only the dentate and interposed nuclei were transsynaptically labelled after cortical injections [262375]. Some injections of [24110177] were restricted to the interposed nuclei. Some injections [252631181183] were restricted to the fastigial nucleus. The projection to the supplementary motor cortex found by many authors [81164232318376] was recently denied and attributed to the concomittent injection of 'pre-SMA' frontal eye fled and supplementary motor eye field [334]. In this place labelled islands were observed [119] retrogradelly after area 4 injections (vertical hatching). 10L of [329] showed labelled islands of neurons in the same place after area 5 injections. [239] made injections and observed a projection to 4 and 3a. Most experimental data have been drawn from observations after lesion of the substantia nigra region and the dopaminergic nigrostriatal tract with or without injection of harmaline [121198296]. Pallidal injection sites Pallidal injections of anterograde tracers all extended over a large pallidal volume. In MI27 and MI31 the injection filled the anterior two thirds and in MI33 the posterior two thirds of the pallidum. In MI 28 the injection was almost complete. In all cases there was some injection of the internal capsule and of the medial part of the lateral pallidum. Vertical hatching injection site (see also Figs. Track of injection in levels + 6.5 to + 7.3 with most medial position at level CP + 7. Vertical hatching injection site (see also Figs9 and 11). Source of the pallidothalamic axons The extent of the three intrathalamic injections of a retrograde tracer included all the thalamic regions receiv- ing axons from the pallidum. Vertical hatching injection site (see also Figs. These are furnished with pallidal inputs by several modestly branched axons observed after PHA-L injection 'forming rather dense terminal plexuses'. 16 and 17 had an almost complete injection with only a small anterior and ventral non-injected portion. Due to the rather large injections the topography of the territory was identical to that of dorsal injections (MI43 and MI35) and also lateral (MM18) or antero-medial (MM21) injections. Source of the nigrothalamic axons In the two cases where injections of WGA-HRP were placed in the thalamic territory the cell bodies of project- ing neurons were found as already shown [106] in the pars reticulata and mixta (located above the pars com- pacta) and not in the pars lateralis. Vertical hatching injection site (see also Figs. Vertical hatching injection site (see also Figs. The oblique transcapsular trajectory of the injection needle is shown hatched diagonally.

After large injections into the amygdala in three mon- keys we observed a projection of amygdalar axons in the medial and ventral part of the nigral territory. In monkey MS16 which received an injection of HRP in the nigral territory [106] there were labelled neurons in the substantia nigra and in the amygdala. Few fibers were labelled after Biocytin injection into the amyg- dala in MM27.""",

Nonetheless following unilateral injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in macaque prefrontal cortex we have observed labeled thalamic cells that although lying close to the midline are clearly located in the contralateral thalamus. In Cases 12 and 3 a series of sections through the injection site was reacted with diaminobenzidine (DAB). The frontal areas included in the injection sites were determined by comparison to the macaque cytoarchitectonic map of Walker ('40). We considered the effective injection site to be the area of cortex in which the concentration of TMB reaction product was sufficient to render the cortex opaque or black under brightfield illumination obscuring labeled axons and perikarya (Mesulam '82). Estimated injection sites obtained with this criterion were more conservative than those obtained with DAB the dense TMB zone being considerably larger than the region which contained the core and halo of DAB reaction product. In Case 1 in which two pellets were placed in the ventral rim of the rostral principal sulcus the injection site included rostral portions of the lateral medial and orbital cortex. In Case 2 with two pellets placed near the orbital margin the injection site covered the lateral part of the orbital surface and much of the cortex ventral to the principal sulcus on the lateral surface. Four pellets were implanted at the dorsomedial margin of the frontal lobe in Case 3 and the injection site included the frontal pole much of the cortex dorsal to the principal sulcus and the medial cortex. The injection site included mainly the cortex within and surrounding the principal sulcus although there was also some involvement of lateral orbital cortex. In Cases 1 and 3 the estimated injection sites included the rostral portions of cingulate cortex to varying degrees in addition to prefrontal cortex. In Case 3 in which pellets were placed mesially the presence of a small amount of diffuse reaction product in the contralateral ventromedial cortex raised the possibility that HRP may have spread to the opposite hemisphere although this observation is also consistent with anterograde transport from the injection site. In spite of differences in the location of injections the distribution of labeled cells and fibers in the 10969861 1987 2 Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.902570211 by Rwth Aachen Hochschulbibliothe Wiley Online Library on [12/09/2023]. The region of cortex containing dense tetramethyl benzidine (TMB) reaction product which we regard as the effective injection site is indicated by dark hatching. In Case 2 the injection site is centered in area 12 at the orbital marpin but also involves ventral area 46 in and around the principal sulcus as well as areas 11 and 13 on the orbital surface. The injection site for Case 3 covers virtually all of Walkers areas 9 and 10 along with portions of areas 46 12 11 25 and 24. In Case 4 the injection site is centered on the principal sulcus (Walkers area 46) spreading into adjacent parts of areas 911 and 12. In this and all subsequent figures the left side of the brain is ipsilateral to the cortical injection. A major result of this study is that in the hemisphere contralateral to the injection anterograde label was found in 10969861 1987 2 Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.902570211 by Rwth Aachen Hochschulbibliothe Wiley Online Library on [12/09/2023]. In all cases contralateral MDmc was heavily labeled and MDpc lightly labeled even though both subdivisions of MD were very heavily labeled ipsilateral to the injection (Figs. 3A) although the densely labeled portion of MDmc was more restricted anteroposteriorly in the thalamus contralateral to the injection than ipsilaterally. A: In the left thalamus ipsilateral to the injection anterograde label is dense in both MDpc and MDmc. By contrast it appears that few if any crossed prefrontothalamic fibers travel in the large commissures of the forebrain as we observed no labeled fibers descending from the corpus callosum in the internal capsule contralateral to the injection or in the anterior commissure. Labeled cells are present on both sides of the midline although they are more numerous ipsilateral to the injection. Since we observed approximately 15 cells per section in the densely labeled region of contralatera1 AM and we saved and reacted every tenth section through the thalamus we estimate that there were typically several hundred cells in contralateral AM that projected to any given area of prefrontal cortex injected in this study. First HRP could have spread from the injection site to the contralateral hemisphere. In three of the four cases however HRP was clearly limited to the injected hemisphere; in the one instance (Case 3) in which HRP may have spread to the opposite hemisphere there was no evidence of subsequent transport to the thalamus. Ipsilateral thalamic labeling The observed pattern of retrograde and anterograde labeling of the thalamus ipsilateral to the injection is largely consistent with previous investigations of the thalamic connectivity of prefrontal cortex in primates (thalamocortical projections: Asanuma et al. We attribute these differences to the superior sensitivity of the anterograde HRP tracing method used in this investigation compared to the autoradiographic and degeneration methods used in prior studies and to the large size of our injections. The very dense projection to contralateral MDmc observed in Case 2 may arise from the orbital cortex as both Goldman ('79) and Akert and Hartmann-von Monikow ('80) reported dense projections to contralateral MDmc in macaques with injections of radioactive tracer confined to this region. ('85) injected WGA-HRP into rat motor cortex and noted that ""one or two labeled cells were occasionally observed in some sections in the contralateral thalamus."" However Jurgens ('82) noted bilateral retrograde labeling of Cif Reu and MD following injections of free HRP into squirrel monkey motor cortex and Asanuma et al. ('85) observed bilateral retrograde labeling of Cdc and the central medial nucleus (CeM) with fluorescent dye injections in macaque prefrontal cortex (CeM probably corresponds to Cif in Olszewski's nomenclature).

However the crossed projections originating from these nuclei may not terminate exclusively in the prefrontal region as Cavada and Goldman-Rakic (unpublished observation) have observed labeled cells in the contralateral AM following injections of WGA-HRP in macaque posterior parietal cortex. (These observations made with much smaller injections of tracer than those of the present study also indicate that large injections are not required to demonstrate crossed thalamocortical projections.) ('85) have reported that sectioning the corpus callosum in rats results in no apparent diminution of anterograde labeling of the contralateral thalamus following cortical HRP injections.""",

Small injections restricted to areas 23a 23b or 30 provide a basis for distinguishing among the connections of these areas and those of' area 29. MATERIALS AND METHODS Surgical procedures In all instances in which injections were made into cingulate cortex the monkey was anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and mounted in a stereotaxic instrument. A midline craniotomy was made and mannitol (Osmitrol 25%) was injected I.V. First ten animals received large 0.2-0.3-pl injections of 20% HRP in cingulate cortex and were allowed to survive 2 days. In a second series of five animals very limited HRP injections were made with 0.015 pl of 5% HRP conjugated to wheat germ agglutinin (HRP-WGA Sigma) and the brains were prepared according to the above protocol.

The autoradiographic data were verified by injecting each cortical projection area with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and observing the pattern of retrogradely labeled somata within the thalamus. Injections in the precentral gyrus near the anterior subcentral sulcus retrogradely labeled neurons within VPMpc whereas injections further caudally near the floor of the central sulcus labeled neurons within VPM. METHODS Subjects Fourteen juvenile and adult cynomolgus monkeys (M. fmcicularis) ranging in weight from 1.5 to 7.0 kg received injections of tritiated leucine and/or proline (50-125 pCiIp1) in either the thalamic taste area (the parvicellular division of the ventroposteromedial nucleus; VPMpc) or the thalamic trigeminal somatosensory nucleus (VPM) or in adjacent nongustatory nonlingual areas. These autoradiographic deposits were made either by pressure injection (20-120 nl) or iontophoretically (+ lpA for 8-10 minutes). Bilateral tritiated amino acid injections were made in two monkeys after it was determined that all thalamocortical projections under study were ipsilateral. Five of these monkeys received bilateral injections. Areas of autoradiographic label HRP-labeled neuronal perikarya cytoarchitectonic boundaries and injection sites were subsequently added to the anatomical charts by using bIood vessels and gross anatomical boundaries as landmarks. Autoradiographic and horseradish peroxidase injection sites were considered to have a primary focus and a halo of secondary involvement (e.g. Areas of light label (signal-to-noise ratio approximately 2:l) were noted only if the label could be traced from the injection site appeared on two or more adjacent sections and confirmed other cases where more definitive label was observed. RESULTS Cortical projections of the ventroposteromedial nucleus Discrete unilateral autoradiographic injections were made within the VPMpc (N = 3) VPM (N = 2) centromedianum (CM N = l) and along the VPMpcNPM border (N = 3) in nine monkeys. In two additional cases bilateral injections were made in the VPMpc and VPM (cases HllR and H11L) and within the VPM and nucleus centromedianum (cases HlOR and HlOL). The differential distribution of the VPMpc and VPM efferent projections on cortex is best illustrated by those cases in which small restricted autoradiographic injections were made. For this reason the injections made in one bilateral preparation (cases HllR and H11L) and one unilateral case (case R4) are described in detail. Animals that received bilateral injections were given case numbers with the suffix R or L. In several of the experimental cases the autoradiographic injection spread beyond the ventrobasal thalamus into the CM. Autoradiographic injections of the CM (cases R14 HlOL) that did not spread into either VPMpc or VPM produced dense terminal label within the caudal ventrolateral putamen but not within cortex. An additional control injection medial to the VPMpc in case R12 failed to label any cortical fields. Mechanical stimulation of the tongue did not drive neurons near the injection site but was an effective stimulus for neurons at two other locations 1.0 mm lateral and dorsal to the target. Although the injection was centered in the VPMpc there was secondary involvement of the VPM and nucleus centromedianum (CM). Labeled axons were noted leaving the injection site anterior and lateral through the VPM and VPL as well as within the internal capsule. This thalamostriate projection was weak in this case but more pronounced in others in which the injection sites involved ventral the CM to a greater degree. Efferent projections of the VPM: Case HllL mediobasal injection The autoradiographic deposit in case H11L was made in the mediobasal corner of the VPM 1.0 mrn lateral to an area where neurons responded to both gustatory and mechanical stimulation of the tongue (Figs. This injection was made contralateral to the injection of the VPMpc described in the previous section (case H11R). 2. fiojection drawing of coronal sections from case HllR showing an autoradiographic injection site centered in the VPMpc and the resultant terminal plexus on orbitofrontal insular and opercular cortices as wet1 as on the precentral gyrus.

Efferent projections of the VPM: Case R4 dorsolateral injection The injection site in case R4 was centered in the dorsolatera1 VPM. Neurons within the region of the injection site responded to mechanical stimulation of the tongue primarily of the contralateral side. Other labeled fibers reached motor and premotor cortex caudal to the principal sulcus presumably due to spread of the injection into the VL. Figure 8 summarizes the distribution of the thalamic afferent plexus observed in four separate experiments following autoradiographic injections into the VPMpc and VPM. Two of these injections have been described in detail previously.

The orthographic reconstruction of cortex in the lower left comer shows the relationship between the data from this case and the total projection area based upon all of the VPMpc and VPM autoradiographic injections (see Fig. Projection drawing of coronal sections from case R4 showing the autoradiographic injection site centered in the dorsolateral corner of VPM and the resultant terminal plexus on the pre- and post central gyri. The orthographic projection in the lower right corner shows the relationship between the data from this case and the total projection area based upon all of the VPMpc and VPM autoradiographic injections. The two injections differ however in that only one! injection (case H1OR) spread significantly into the VPMpc. Two additional autoradiographic injections (cases R4 and R9) placed further dorsolaterally within the VPM labeled cortex more medially and as far caudally as the floor of the central sulcus. Collectively the injection sites in these preparations involved all of the VPMpc as well as dorsal and medial VPM. HRP results In each case described above the injection site spread beyond the target area making it difficult to determine precisely the nuclear boundaries from which the cortical labeling originated. The cells of origin within the thalamus were located by injecting HRP into each cortical area revealed in the autoradiographic experiments: orbitofrorital cortex frontal insular and opercular cortices and the lateral margin of the precentral gyrus. Figure 9 shows the location of four ELRP injection sites superimposed on an orthographic map sum- :\ \ \ - Fig. Orthographic projection summarizing the total distribution of cortical label based upon all of the VPMpc and VPM autoradiographic injections. The densest part of each of four autoradiographic injection sites was drawn on a single projection drawing of the left thalamus. Two small (30 nl) injections of HRP were made in lateral orbitofrontal cortex in case H13L after multineuron responses were recorded in the region during electrical stimulation of the VPMpc. In another preparation (case H12L) an injection made further caudally in the insula proper produced a similar pattern of light retrograde cell labeling in the VPMpc. In one case (H9R) there was retrograde label in the medial putamen following an HRP injection of the rostra1 precentral gym. A similar pattern of retrograde labeling was found in the VPMpc following HRP injections into cortex lateral to the anterior subcentral sulcus (cases H2 and. corded at the injection site during gustatory and tactile stimulation of the posterior tongue as well as during elec-- trical stimulation of the VPMpc (latency 5-14 ms). Small clusters of densely labeled neurons were also foundl within the paralamellar division of medialis dorsalis (MD) and centralis lateralis following injections of HRP into the most rostral part of the precentral gyrus (cases H2 H9R and H11). The labeled neurons observed in case H7 are probably due to inadvertent spread of the HRP injection to broken fibers o:f passage dorsal to the operculum. The cortex on the postcentral gyrus overlying this injection site was responsive to perioral tactile stimulation usually of the lips and cheek. In the present experiment horseradish peroxidase injections into insular-opercular cortex and the precentral gyrus retrogradely labeled neurons in the VPMpc but not in the pontine parabrachial nuclei or any other area caudal to the diencephalon. In a related set of experiments in Old World monkey which will be reported separately autoradiographic injections into the pontine parabrachial nuclei also failed to reveal any projections to cortex (Hamilton et al.

The autoradiographic injections of the ventrobasal thalamus that Burton and Jones ('76) used to parse SI cortex included not only the thalamic oral and perioral somatosensory area (VPM) but also the thalamic taste area (VPMpc). In the present report more circumscribed autoradiographic injections of the thalamic taste area reveal that the VPMpc projects to the precentral gyrus within area 3b rostral to (though perhaps partially overlapping) the oral and perioral somatosensory field. This was verified by injecting the VPMpc projection area on the precentral gyrus with horseradish peroxidase and observing retrogradely labeled somata within the VPMpc. Based on our injections of horseradish peroxidase into the precentral gyrus we conclude that the laryngeal and gustatory areas are discrete. Previous descriptions of the afferent connections of the motor and sensory laryngeal areas were based upon large horseradish peroxidase injections that probably spread into the gustatory projection area as well (Jurgens '82). In the present study horseradish peroxidase injections in the cortical gustatory area retrogradely labeled somata in the VPMpc and medialis dorsalis but not in anterior cingulate or mediofrontal cortex.""",

Selemon Ph.D. Department of Neuroscience Yale University School of Medicine New Haven CT USA Abstract Maternal injection of 3H-thymidine ([3H]dT) during gestation in non-human primates (NHPs) has been used to determine the time of neurogenesis for various brain areas including the lateral geniculate (LGN) and the pulvinar (PUL) nuclei of the caudal thalamus. The MacBrainResource (MBR) search function identified archived cases (N=10) of [3H]dT labeled specimens with injection dates ranging from embryonic day 25 (E25)-E50 and postnatal sacrifice dates. The time of neurogenesis of many brain areas in the NHP has been determined by means of maternal injection of 3H-thymidine ([3H]dT) at various gestational ages. In these studies systemically injected [3H]dT was incorporated into the DNA of dividing cells. those cells that had undergone only one final division between time of injection and time of sacrifice. maternal injection of [3H]dT ranging from embryonic day 25 (E25) to E50 and postnatal sacrifice dates. Specifically following systemic injection of [3H]dT at embryonic ages the brains were fixed via perfusion with Karnovskys solution. A cell was considered labeled for [ 3H]dT and therefore to have undergone final cell division at the time of injection if 5 silver grains were visible over the cell (Figure 3). Interspecies Comparisons Maternal injection of [3H]dT also has been used to examine the development of thalamic nuclei in rodents. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Technical Considerations Data were collected from brains at various gestational ages but not every embryonic age was examined because the original studies injected animals only at selected ages and because certain cases were excluded from analysis due to insufficient quality of cell labeling. In doing so we found that case 080872A which previously had been designated as having an injection at E53/E54 in fact had been injected at E48. Today these experiments which involve timed pregnancies systemic injection of [3H]dT in pregnant monkeys monitoring of fetal health a functioning infant primate nursery and long-term survival times would not only be prohibitively expensive but would also be nearly impossible to replicate given the strict regulatory guidelines for primate research.

This stain permitted the analysis of cortical cytoarchitecture localization of the injection site and identification of the boundaries of thalamic nuclei. The precise location of each injection site was determined by observing the cortical architecture around the labeled area in the cortex and comparing this with the architecture of the corresponding nonlabeled area of the opposite hemisphere. Orbital frontal and medial prefrontal proisocortices In two cases separate injections were made into the caudal orbital frontal and rostra1 medial prefrontal regions (Fig. In case 1 the injection involved the caudal portion of area 13 in the orbital frontal cortex whereas in case 2 the injection occupied area 32 and extended slightly into adjoining area 25 of the medial prefrontal cortex.

Key words: Thalamus - Frontal cortex - Cortical HRP injections - Thalamo-frontal connexions - Rhesus monkey - Thalamic organization Introduction The organization of thalamo-cortical connexions has been studied repeatedly since the pioneering efforts of Le Gros Clark (1935) and Walker (193 8a). Therefore in a series of rhesus monkeys HRP was injected in different frontal cortical areas and the distribution of the retrogradely labelled thalamic neurons was studied. Materials and Methods In 23 rhesus monkeys 6-25 closely spaced injections of 0.6 ~tl of 10-30% horseradish peroxidase (HRP Sigma VI) dissolved in distilled water were made in circumscribed parts of the frontal cortex by means of a Hamilton syringe with a 22 gauge needle which was introduced to a depth of + 21/2 ram. In 13 of the animals the injections were made in one hemisphere. Since in these cases labelled thalamic neurons were present only ipsilaterally in the remaining 10 animals injections were made in both hemispheres and the labelled neurons in the thalamus on either side were regarded to reflect only the injections in the ipsilateral hemisphere. From the injected cortex and the immediately underlying white matter evenly brown stained fibers proceeded towards the internal capsule. In the cases with injections in the lower one-third of the precentral and postcentral gyri (cf. The experiments may be subdivided into four groups: A. cases with injections in the orbitofrontal cortex and the cortex of the most rostral portion of the frontal convexity; B. cases with injections in the periarcuate cortex i.e. above below and within the concavity of the arcuate sulcus; C. cases with injections in the precentral gyrus; and D. cases with injections in the postcentral and parietal areas. It had been assumed that after HRP injections in the different frontal areas different specific thalamic nuclei would be labelled. After injections in the rostral parts of the frontal lobe the bands and columns were located medially in the thalamus while after progressively more caudal injections they were located progressively more laterally.

Injections in Orbitofrontal Cortex and Rostral Part of Frontal Convexity In the four cases of this group the longitudinal bands or columns of labelled neurons were located mainly in the medial part of the thalamus where they extended from the area of the anterior midline nuclei (Ce) and the medial part of the VA through the MD into the anterior part of the Pm (Fig. In case A2 with 15 injections in the cortex on the convexity of the rostral part of the frontal lobe and in the underlying white matter the HRP-positive cortical area extended from the injection site into the most anterior parts of the orbitofrontal cortex and the superior frontal gyrus on the medial surface of the hemisphere. In cases A3 and A4 with 12 injections more laterally above and below the rostral part of the principal sulcus respectively the longitudinal columns of labelled neurons behaved in roughly the same manner as in case A2 but occupied a relatively more ventral portion in the VA and the MD (Fig. This was especially obvious in case A4 with injections lateral to the principal sulcus. In five cases (B 1-B5) injections were made rostrally in the periarcuate area. In case B1 with 18 injections around the rostral tip of the upper limb of the arcuate sulcus the HRP-positive cortical area overlapped rostrally with that of case A2 and extended from the superior frontal gyrus on the medial surface of the hemisphere into the intermediate portion of the upper bank of the principal sulcus.

In case C2 in which the row of injections continued into the lower one-third of the precentral gyrus the longitudinal population of labelled neurons extended ventromedially (Fig. In the other cases of this group with injections in different mediolateral parts of the caudal portion of the precentral gyrus tall vertically oriented longitudinal groups of labelled neurons occurred which after progressively more lateral injections in the precentral gyrus were located progressively more medially in VL. In one case (C3) 18 injections were made in the lower one-third of the precentral gyrus next to the central sulcus and the HRP-positive cortical area extended into its rostral bank. In three cases (C5 C6 and C7) with 6 6 and 14 injections respectively in the precentral gyrus immediately above the knee of the central sulcus the vertically oriented longitudinal group of labelled neurons extended through the intermediate segments of the VLo the VIM and the ventral part of the VLc (case C5 Fig. In three other cases (C8 C9 and C10) with 6 8 and 11 injections respectively at the level of the superior precentral dimple the Fig. Semidiagrammatic representation of the HRP-positive cortical areas (solid black ++  o~169 ) and the distributions of the retrogradely labelled thalamic neurons (~o  +%  o~ ) after injections in the caudal part of the precentral gyrus. Column on right shows combined distributions of the labelled neurons in the central and peripheral parts of the thalamus in cases with injections along medial ( . In three cases (C14 C15 and C16) with 18 16 and 5 injections respectively in the upper portion of the caudal part of the precentral gyrus and the immediately underlying white matter the longitudinal group of labelled neurons was located very laterally in the thalamus and extended from the lateral parts of the VLo into the lateral parts of the VIM and the ventrolateral portion of the VLc. However in cases C14 and C16 with injections in the cortex immediately adjoining the upper portion of the central sulcus the group of labelled neurons continued caudally into the most lateral part of the VPLc (case C14 Fig. 3) while in case C15 without injections in this area no labelled neurons were present in the VPLc. In addition in all cases with injections in the caudal part of the precentral gyrus many lightly labelled neurons were present in the caudal parts of the CL and some in the CM. In four other cases linear rows of injections were made which extended from the central sulcus rostrally. In cases Cll-C13 these rows of 16 injections extended through the area of the superior precentral dimple towards the area above the caudal part of the arcuate sulcus while in case C17 a longer linear row of injections was placed along the medial margin of the hemisphere extending from the upper part of the precentral gyrus into the area above the upper limb of the arcuate sulcus (cases Cll and C17 Fig. In case C4 8 injections were made around the inferior precentral dimple i.e. D. Postcentral and Parietal Injections In case D1 10 injections were made in the rostral part of the postcentral gyrus. In case D2 18 injections were made in the superior and the inferior parietal lobules. Discussion The present findings demonstrate that HRP-injections in different frontal cortical areas result in the labelling of longitudinal columns of thalamic neurons. Cortical Strips and Thalamic Bands The various injection sites were chosen such that the resulting HRP-positive cortical areas could be combined into transverse cortical strips resembling the anatomical and functional subdivisions of the frontal lobe (yon Bonin and Bailey 1947; Woolsey et al. Labelling of Specific Thalamic Nuclei The distribution of labelled MD neurons after the various injections supports earlier conclusions (Walker 1938a; Nauta 1962; Akert 1964; Tobias 1975) concerning the organization of the MD projections to the frontal lobe. 1) with injections around the rostral end of the upper limb of the arcuate sulcus. The almost exclusive labelling of VPLc and VPM and VPI after postcentral injections is in keeping with earlier findings (Strick 1976) and supports the contention that the VB complex and apparently especially its caudal part (VPLc) projects mainly to areas 3 1 and 2 (Jones and Powell 1970; Burton and Jones 1976). Labelling of neurons laterally in VPLc after injections in the rostral bank of the upper end of the central sulcus (cases C14 and C16) probably reflects the presence of area 3a in the deep part of the rostral bank at this level (Powell and Mountcastle 1959). The existence of VPM projections to the postcentral gyms the lower one-third of the precentral gyrus (area 3) and the precentral operculum (Walker 1938a; Roberts and Akert 1963; Burton and Jones 1976) is compatible with the labelling of the VPM after precentral and postcentral injections (cases C3 and D1) and is in keeping with the existence of projections from the lower one-third of the precentral and the postcentral gyrus to the VPM (Sakai~ 1967; Kfinzle 1976). The labelling of neurons in the lateral paralaminar MD after arcuate gyrus injections i.e. For example after rostral frontal injections these groups of neurons extended from the medial part of the VA across the internal medullary lamina through the MD into the Pm (cf. Moreover after injections in the caudal part of the area above the arcuate sulcus (case B6 Fig. Yet the fact that columns of labelled neurons extending through several nuclei also occurred after restricted injections (cases B2 C4) and that such columns show a systematic shift through the nuclei after injections in adjacent cortical areas (cf. 1) with injections around the rostral end of the upper limb of arcuate sulcus and (B) shows the labelled neurons in the lateral part of MD in CL and in the medial part of VL in case B6 (cf. 2) with injections in caudal part of the area above arcuate sulcus 320 J.

Data on isotope concentration total amount injected and description of injection sites are given in Table 1 and an example of an injection site in GPm is shown in Figure 3A. The topography in fiber distribution was noted in that the medially placed injections resulted in preferential labeling of fibers in ansa lenticularis whereas the lenticular fasciculus was more intensely labeled after laterally placed injections. Laterally placed injections in the GPm resulted in dense labeling of densicellular subdivision of VA (VAdc) and Ce.

In contrast the entire VApc was labeled when the injection sites involved the most medial part of the GPm. For this isotope injections in the cerebellum were made in four monkeys. Three received unilateral injections and one bilateral injections into deep cerebellar nuclei. Data on the concentration and amount of the isotope as well as the locations of injection sites are given in Table 1 and an example of an injection site in the dentate nucleus (DN) is demonstrated in Figure 3B. The largest injection covered the anterior two-thirds of the DN throughout its mediolatera1 extent leaving its most posterior part free of label.

Despite variations in size and location of injection sites the course and distribution of labeled fibers in the subthalamus and thalamus were remarkably consistent. Density of silver grains and the size of labeled zones over the thalamic nuclei varied depending on the volume of delivered radioactive material and location of the injection sites. Thus the lateral VL region was labeled almost completely as a result of tracer injections in the anterior half of the DN. Since in our cases the most posterior segment of the DN was never involved in the injection sites it is not surprising that the labeling pattern in the medial VL was remarkably different from that observed in the lateral VL (Fig. The most lateroposterior part of MD also contained a considerable number of dense clusters of silver grains but only in cases in which DN was involved in the injection site.

Autoradiography Experimental animals (cases # 1-6 Table 1) received injections of 45-3[H]-leucine (ICN) in a final concentration of 50-75 pCi/pL into different parts of the SN. The isotope was reconstituted in sterile saline and delivered through a Hamilton microsyringe with the total injected volume varying in different experiments from 0.6 to 1.5 pL. Experiments with fluorescent tracers In two monkeys (cases # 7 and # 8 Table 1) injections of three fluorescent dyes (Fast Blue Diamidino Yellow and Propidium Iodide) were made in different cortical areas in the same hemisphere. Fast Blue (FB; concentration 570 Illing KG) was injected into the supplementary motor cortex and Diamidino Yellow dihydrochloride (DY; concentration 2%; Illing KG )was injected into the hand area of the primary motor cortex 7 days before perfusion. Propidium Iodide (PI; concentration 3%; Sigma) was injected into both the dorsal and ventral banks of the principal sulcus in one of these monkeys (case #7) and into only the dorsal bank of the principal sulcus in the other monkey (case # 8) 2 days before perfusion. In a third monkey (case #9) FB was injected into the orbital cortex and DY was injected into the dorsal bank of the principal sulcus in the left hemisphere; in the right hemisphere the frontal eye field and the ventral bank of the principal sulcus were injected with FB and DY respectively.

Altogether eight to 12 injections were made in each cortical zone with 0.5-1.0 p1 of dye delivered at each penetration. The injection rate (0.1 pl per minute) was controlled using a Harvard microliter syringe pump. Thalamic connnections of the substantia nigra Description of radiolabeled injection sites. In these animals both SNc and SNr were included in the injection site due to their intercalation throughout the SN. However labeled terminal zones were detected in the thalamus only in those three animals in which injection sites were located in the anterior half of the SN (cases #1 5 6). In three other animals the injection sites were located in the posterior part of the SN (cases #2 3 4). Labeled fibers leaving these injection sites coursed anteriorly swept around the pallidum and then continued within the internal capsule to terminate throughout the caudate and putamen. Following posterior SN injections a few scattered fibers were detected in Forels fields heading toward the thalamus but no terminal labeling was observed in any thalamic nuclei except for some weak labeling in the centromedianum-parafascicular complex (Ce-Pf). Since the topographic distribution of nigrostriatal nigrotectal and nigrotegmental projections is beyond the scope of this paper the following description of the nigrothalamic pathway will be based mainly on the results of the three injections in the anterior part of the SN (Fig. The mediolateral extent of the injection sites differed in these three animals. Our most lateral injection (case # 1) occupied the mediolateral region between 5.0 and 7.0 mm (Figs. Another injection extended from 4.0 and 6.0 mm (Fig. This posterior bundle is more pronounced following laterally placed SN injections while the anterior group is denser in the cases with more medial SN injections. The thalamic nuclei that contained labeling following ipsilateral injections of the SN included the VAmc VLm MD and Ce-Pf complex though among these nuclei the density and distribution of autoradiographic grains varied.

Brightfield photomicrograph of a sagittal section at 6.0 mm from the midline demonstrating the center of the injection site in the SN (case #lL X6.7. The location and extent of the projection zone varied for different injection sites in the SN. Lateral injections of the SN labeled terminals throughout the posterior and lateral portions of the VAmc (Fig. 5) while medial injections of the SN gave rise to a continuous terminal zone throughout the medial part of the VAmc (Fig. The mediodorsal nucleus (MD) contained dense aggregations of silver grains in different subdivisions depending on the injection site in the SN. In particular the most lateral SN injection (case #1) resulted in very dense labeling of the paralaminar part of the MD. In addition to the MDmf projections several clustered arrangements of silver grains were scattered throughout the MDpc and MDdc following the most lateral SN injection (Fig. None of these subdivisions (MDmf MDpc and MDdc) contained label after more medial SN injections. On the other hand in two animals with injection sites involving the medial part of the SN (cases #5 and 6). Such labeling was found in the ventral posterior part of the Pf following the most lateral SN injection (Fig. 5) while after medial SN injections the labeled zone extended farther anteriorly involving in addition a small ventral portion of the Ce. Faint labeling in the Ce-Pf was also observed following injections in the posterior part of the SN (cases # 2 # 3 # 4). Cortical connections of thalamic areas receiving nigral afferents Description of fluorescent injection sites. The FB injection into the supplementary motor area (SMA) in the same case was smaller and also charaterized by needle tracks surrounded by bright fluorescent zones (Fig. The DY injection sites in the primary motor cortex were small irregular in shape and confined to the middle portion of the anterior bank of the central sulcus (Fig. Some of the injections in the motor area penetrated into the underlying white matter. Evaluation of injections sites in case # 8 (Fig. 9D) revealed similar uptake and location of fluorescent dyes in the prefrontal supplementary motor and motor cortical areas with the exception of the PI which was injected only in the dorsal bank of PS. In case #9 the FB and DY injection sites were restricted respectively to the frontal eye field (FEF) and ventral bank of the PS in one hemisphere (Fig. Retrogradely labeled neurons were found in VAmc following injections into all cortical areas but the motor cortex. Following FB injections in the orbital cortex (case #9) numerous retrogradely labeled neurons occupied the medial part of the VAmc at sagittal levels between 0.7 and 2.5 mm from the midline (Fig. After PI injections into both banks of PS (Fig. 11) labeled cells were also observed in the medial portion of VAmc though they extended more dorsally and laterally than neurons labeled from orbital cortex injections. However small DY injections in the dorsal bank of PS in one hemisphere and in the ventral bank in another hemisphere (case # 9) did not provide any clear-cut indication that neurons targeting different banks of the PS had widely separate origins within the VAmc. In all cases of PS as well as orbital cortex injections some labeled neurons were also seen in the VA proper and midline thalamic nuclei. Retrogradely labeled neurons in the VAmc were also observed after FB injections in the frontal eye field (FEF). In this case FB labeled cells occupied more lateral levels of the VAmc than neurons labeled from injections in the orbital cortex (Fig. Darkfield autoradiographs of sagittal sections at different mediolateral levels demonstrating projection zones in the thalamus and the course of nigral fibers in the diencephalon following the most lateral SN injection (Case #l). A considerable number of VAmc cells were also labeled from injections into the SMA (cases # 7 and 8). Darkfield autoradiographs of sagittal sections at two medial levels demonstrating the projection zone in the VAmc following the most medial SN injection (case 6). A variable number of fluorescent neurons were found in one or more subdivision of the MD following dye injections in all five cortical areas studied. Injections in the orbital cortex and PS labeled a large number of cells in both MDmc and MDpc with a preponderance of neurons in the MDmc following the orbital injection and in the MDpc following PS injections (Figs. Separate injections confined respectively to the dorsal and ventral bank of the PS (case #9) revealed that neurons projecting to the dorsal bank were concentrated in the dorsal region of the MD while those to the ventral bank were observed in the ventral region of the MD. A few scattered labeled neurons were also found in the medial part of MDmf from injections in both PS and orbital cortex. In sharp contrast injections in the FEF resulted in dense labeling throughout the entire mediolateral extent of the MDmf as well as in the most anterior part of the MD (Fig. Labeled cells were found in the VLm after injections in the motor cortex SMA and the orbital region of the prefrontal cortex but not after injections in either or both banks of the PS. lo) while the lateral region of this nucleus was occupied by cells labeled following motor and premotor cortical injections (Fig. Following injections into the primary motor cortex a considerable number of labeled cells were found in the VLm. Midline nuclei such as reuniens (Re) and central laterocellular (CLc) also contained labeled cells especially following orbital cortex injections. Numerous dye-containing neurons were observed in the medial regions of pulvinar complex (Pul) and lateral posterior nucleus (LP) after fluorescent dye injections in all regions of the prefrontal cortex studied here (Figs. The ventral part of the Ce-Pfcomplex contained scattered dye-positive cells after injections in the orbital cortex but 10969861 1985 3 Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.902360304 by Rwth Aachen Hochschulbibliothe Wiley Online Library on [12/09/2023]. X70 virtually no labeled cells were observed following PS injections. Greater numbers of labeled neurons were observed in this nuclear complex after injections in the supplementary and primary motor cortical areas (Fig. The cells labeled by SMA injections were located preferentially in the dorsal region of the Ce with only a few extending into Pf while those labeled from the primary motor cortex were found only in the ventrolateral part of the Ce. Within other intralaminar nuclei a few labeled cells were occasionally seen in the paracentral nucleus (Pcn) following prefrontal cortex injections. In contrast SMA injections resulted in numerous labeled neurons uniformly distributed throughout Pcn and also the central superior nucleus (Cs). The number of cells in area X was greater after injections in the SMA while cells labeled from the primary motor cortex were located predominantly in the VPLo. A.

Special attention was paid to the second somatosensory area (SZ) the connections of which were also studied by means of thalamic isotope injections and retrograde degeneration. Following small injections of isotope or HRP into the hand representation of S2 only VPL was labeled. Larger injections which included the representations of more body parts led to heavy label in VPI with scattered label in VPLc the central lateral nucleus (CL) and the posterior nucleus (Po). In addition small isotope injections into VPLc did not result in label in S2 unless VPI was also involved in the injection site and ablations of S2 led to cell loss in VPI. Comparison of injections involving different body parts in S2 suggested a somatotopic arrangement within VPE such that the trunk and lower limb representations are located posterolaterally and the hand and arm representations anteromedially. A subsequent study (Burton and Jones '76) confirmed and refined the cytoarchitectonic description of this cortical region and described thalamic inputs to all of the fields of the insula and the surrounding opercular regions following thalamic injections of tritiated amino acids. We saw retrograde labeling of neurons in several thalamic nuclei after cortical injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) that were clearly restricted to one field. In addition to this general issue concerning thalamocortical connectivity we saw some instances in which the thalamic nuclei labeled by cortical injections were not those indicated by previous reports. We saw for example dense anterograde and retrograde transport to the ventroposterior inferior thalamic nucleus (VPI) after injections of either tritiated amino acids or HRP made into S2. We therefore undertook a reexamination of the thalamocortical relations of the region of the lateral sulcus based primarily on the results obtained following anterograde and retrograde transport of tracers injected into individual cortical fields defined by their physiological properties architecture and cortical connections. '86) which contains the methods used for identifying the somatosensory fields and detailed descriptions of the injections sites and the histological processing methods. Four of the additional animals received injections of HRP conjugated to wheat germ agglutinin (HRP-WGA) into different parts of S2 or of the insular cortex following aspiration of the frontoparietal operculum to reveal the dorsal aspect of the insula. The fifth monkey received bilateral thalamic injections of isotope. Data from two additional series of monkeys one series with cortical ablations leading to retrograde degeneration in the thalamus and the other series with isotope injections into the thalamus were analyzed as described below. Histological procedures The brains with injections of HRP-WGA were processed by modified versions of the protocols described previously (Mesulam '78). Thalamic injections Brains from seven cynomolgus monkeys that had earlier received injections of isotope into either VPLc or VPM were also available. These animals were from previous studies in which the injection sites have been described in detail (Friedman and Jones '81; Jones and Friedman '82; Jones et al. One additional monkey also received bilateral thalamic isotope injections and the brain was processed for autoradiography by the methods described in the companion paper (Friedman et al. As a group the eight injections covered much of the ventral territory of VPLc and only a small part of VPM and two of the injections involved VPI as well. The cortical sections were examined to see whether thalamwortical terminations were evident in S2 after injections confined to VPLc or VPM or whether involvement of VPI was required for label to appear in S2. Small WI neurons in A are IabeIed with TMB and counterstained with thionin after an injection of HRP into S2. Lower right: Composite map of the lateral sulcus showing the location of the isotope injections in three cases for which the transported label is illustrated in Figures 2-4.

See Figure 1A in Friedman (83) for photomicrograph of injection site. Label was noted within this lamina in several animals with injections in the dysgranular insular field (Id). Connections of S2 Isotope injections. This was true in each of four monkeys that received isotope injections; with 16-30-week exposure times all had dense label in VPI but no more than sparse label in other nuclei of the ventral group. The injections in cases RM1 and CM3 were made through a syringe that had a microelectrode attached to its barrel and the injection in RM2 was made iontophoretically through a glass pipette. 2B in the accompanying paper for injection site) additional terminal labeling was seen within VPLc immediately adjacent to VPI. There was also label in the ventral part of CL in all cases and in cases RM1 and CM3 there was additional label in Pub presumably as a result of leakage of the isotope into the portion of area 7b overlying S2 (see below for analysis of injections into area 7b). HRP injections. In order to determine the origin of the thalamic projection to 52 HRP injections were made into retrogradely labeled thalamic neurons were determined. The extents of four of these injections are shown in Figure 6. Sections from the two smallest injections (CM2 CM15) made iontophoretically and clearly confined to S2 on the parietal operculum of the lateral sulcus are shown in more detail in Figure 7. To examine the possibility raised by the results of the small HRP and isotope injections that only certain portions of S2 receive an input exclusively from VPI the others receiving an input from VPI and VPLc we subsequently made three larger injections of HRP-WGA. The locations of retrogradely labeled thalamocortical relay cells from the largest injection (RM7) are shown in Figure 9 and those from a more restricted injection (RM6) are shown in Figure 11. Because we did not record in the anterior portion of S2 before making this injection it is not clear if the injection site in RM7 involved the portion of S1 on the inner face of the frontoparietal operculum that is known to contain the representation of intraoral structures (Robinson and Burton 'SOa). The label in VPM in this case then may be due to the inclusion of S1 in the injection site. A second smaller injection of HRP-WGA (Fig. In summary the smaller HRP injections failed to label neurons in VPLc whereas the larger ones resulted in scattered retrograde labeling of neurons there. The label in Pulo LP and MDpc is interpreted as being the result of leakage of HRP into the overlying area 7b because neither the HRP nor the isotope injections into S2 that did not involve area 7b resulted in label in these nuclei whereas the injections confined to area 7b inevitably labeled them (see below for details). Labeled fibers and terminals following an injection of isotope into the hand-arm representation of S2 in case CM3. The injection also involved area 7b.

Further data concerning the relationship of VPI and VPLC to S2 were derived from experiments in which isotope was injected into the ventroposterior thalamus. Some injections were restricted entirely to VPLc whereas others spread into VPI; none were limited to VPI. The injection sites illustrated by the open profiles in Figure 12 are those that labeled S1 but not S2 and the sites with filled profiles are those that labeled both S1 and S2. ""here were five injections that failed to label S2; they were confined to VPLC except for one that also involved VPM. By contrast two of the three injections that resulted in label in S2 were the ones that involved VPI as well as VPLc. The third injection that labeled S2 was located in VPM (CM59). This injection labeled a portion of the superior limiting sulcus that appeared on topographic grounds to be in S2. Neither the two cases with isotope injections involving VPM nor others with cortical injections of HRP allowed us to reach a firm conclusion as to whether 52 received projections from VPM. Matched brightfield-darkfield photomicrographs showing anterograde label in VPI following the injection of isotope illustrated in section B Figure 1 (case RM1). Summary of the locations of HRP injections made into S2 on an unfolded map of the lateral sulcus.

Figure 13 shows the label resulting from one of the isotope injections that is representative of the group. Retrograde label was seen in these same nuclei after similarly placed HRP injections (Kasdon and Jacobson '78). The HRP injection resulted in retrogradely labeled neurons in the same nuclei but presumably because it was a small injection there were only a few labeled neurons in each nucleus.

Details concerning the receptive field properties of the neurons near the injection sites are given in the companion paper. 151 the anterior portion of the injection site was located at the posterior pole of the insula and probably spread to parts of S2 that contain the trunk and lower body representations and may have involved the granular insula (Ig) as well. The injection site in case RM3 (Figs. The label in the pulvinar may have resulted from the leakage of isotope into the portion of area 7b that is in the upper bank of the lateral sulcus and through which the injection needle passed to reach Ri in the lower bank of the sulcus. The pattern of cortical label resulting from this injection however suggests that the injection was confined to Ri (Friedman et al. Location of retrogradely labeled neurons in the thalamus following an HRP injection in S2 from case RM6 (see Figure 6). Note lack of label in VPLc and VPM from this relatively small injection. In case RM3 however we could find no label in S1 and therefore cannot explain the label in VPI on the basis of the involvement of S2 in the injection. On the basis of the findings of Burton and Jones one might expect that the label in SG-Li resulted from the inclusion of Ig in the injection site. While this may be plausible for the anterior injection (RM4) the same explanation is not tenable in case RM3 in which the injection was located several millimeters behind the posterior pole of the insula. The single small HRP injection that we have performed resulted in retrogradely labeled neurons in all of these nuclei except VPI thus confirming the reciprocal thalamocortical projections from Po SG-Li MGmc and Pulm. A projection from Ri to the deep layers of the superior colliculus was also noted after isotope injections. Injection into Pa By entering the lower bank of the lateral sulcus directly from its lateral aspect we placed an isotope injection in Pa.

The largest injection (case CM7) also resulted in label in Pulm though it is not clear whether this was caused by involvement of Ia or Id in the injection site. The lack of label in Pulm after the smaller injections suggests that Pulm does not project to Ia. On the other hand our injections were quite small and did not cover the whole of Ia. Thalamic relations of S2 We have presented four kinds of evidence indicating thet S2 receives its major thalamic input from VPI and that this projection is reciprocal: (1) HRP injected into S2 labeled most of the characteristically small neurons within VPI but few of the large VPLc neurons; (2) tritiated amino acids injected into S2 labeled dense aggregations of terminals within VPI but no or few terminals in VPLc; (3) small isotope injections in VPh did not label terminations within S2 unless VPI was also involved in the injection site; and (4) ablation of S2 resulted in retrograde cell degeneration in VPI. These findings are supported by those of Manzoni and his colleagues (84) who have recently reported that following HRP injections into S2 VPI contained large numbers of labeled neurons but label in VPh if present was sparse (6. Distribution of label following injection in case RM3 (see Figure 15). A photomicrograph of the injection site has been published (see Figure 1B in Friedman '83). The label from the injections in the hand-digit representation (RM1 RM2 CM6 CM15) was concentrated anteriorly in the midmediolateral portion of VPI whereas label from injections that involved the representation of the proximal body in addition to the hand (CM1 CM3) or the hindlimb representation in addition to Ri (RM4) occupied the more posterolateral aspects of VPI. None of our S2 injections labeled projections to the most medial parts of VPI though this area was labeled after Id injections. Because we do not have injections in all parts of the S2 body representation however we cannot describe this apparent somatotopy in greater detail. Summary figure showing all HRP injections made into insular cortex on an unfolded reconstruction of the lateral sulcus. ""he coronal sections illustrate the maximal spread of each injection when incubated with ""MB and not counterstained. Hatched area shown in some sections represents region of opercular cortex removed to expose the injection site. These problems were avoided in the study of Burton and Jones ('76) who used the autoradiographic technique for tracing pathways after rather large isotope injections into VB. Unless these injections also included VPI and from their figures it seems that some did not these data indicate that VPLc also projects to 52. ""his conclusion is strengthened by the apparent topographic order of transported label in S2 resulting from their VPLc injections by the results of HRP injections in 52 that also led to label in VPLc (Burton and Robinson '81; present results) and by the recent report of Burton ('84) which illustrated anterograde label in VPI and the surrounding parts of VPLc after injections of isotope into S2. Nevertheless of the seven small isotope injections in VPLc described in the present study only two both of which involved VPI led to label in S2. Only the largest injections led to retrogradely labeled neurons in VPLc and these were 10969861 1986 3 Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.902520305 by Rwth Aachen Hochschulbibliothe Wiley Online Library on [12/09/2023]. Distribution of retrogradely labeled neurons in the thalamus resulting from the HRP injection into Ig in case CM4 (see Figures 17 and 20 for injection site). Labeling nn CM is the result of the injection spreading to the putamen. These observations suggest first that VPLc may project to only certain regions within 52 and second that the projection to S2 may arise from only restricted zones (or neurons) that may be widely spaced in VPLc and could easily be missed by small isotope injections made into VPLc. Support for these ideas comes from one of the most compelling findings of the present study that is the total lack of label in VPLc after small isotope or HRP injections into the S2 hand-digit representation. Following larger injections however label was seen in both VPI and VPLc. Examination of the locations in both the rat and opossum of the injection sites in VB that best labeled S2 shows that they are located in the posteroventral part of VB.

Upper right: Locations of two HRP injections confined to Ig (CiVI4) and Id (CM6) in the cortex are shown in upper right. In CM4 there was spread to the underlying claustrum and putamen and in CM6 the injection spread through the extreme capsule to the superficial border of the claustrum. Upper left: Distribution of labeled cells resulting from the injection of HRP in case CM6. Thus after an injection of HRP or isotope into Ri the most densely labeled nucleus is Po; less dense label is found in MGmc SG-Li Pulm and the intralaminar nuclei. In two of the cases with isotope injections VPI was labeled as well. After HRP injections into Ig SG-Li consistently contained the largest number of labeled neurons with MGmc Po and VPI containing fewer labeled cells. After HRP injections into Id there is a band of label that begins in ventromedial VMb. The injections into Ia result in label mainly in the dorsomedial aspects of VMb and the ventral portions of MD. One methodological factor that must be considered in our analysis of thalamo-insular relations is the use in the present study of small HRP injections. Because a primary concern was to avoid involvement of the claustrum in the injection sites most of the injections were made iontophorPulo Pulm LP M Dpc VLCY Fig. Not only was their cortical spread restricted but the injection sites were not dense. Even when taken as groups the five injections into Ig (Fig. Because of this the injections may not have resulted in significant retrograde transport to regions which in fact project to those fields. This most likely limited their ability to see transported label to only those areas of cortex receiving the heaviest input from each injection site. This viewpoint suggests that the labeling patterns described here after injections confined to individual cortical fields may reflect the thalamic representation of several specific classes of information being received by that field. Projections of the medial pulvinar Among the nuclei labeled after injections into somatosensory cortical fields Pulm has the most widespread projections. A reexamination of the efferents of Pulm and Pulo that utilizes the autoradiographic technique with long exposure times and injection sites selected by recording single-unit response properties in this region would be of help in revealing the organization of these two nuclei. In the present study two injections into ventral Ig which probably also involved the para-insular field resulted in retrogradely labeled neurons in MGv which supplies the major input to Al. In the present study the small population of VPLc neurons labeled after S2 injections was found to be widely scattered in distinct contrast to the clustered arrangement of VPLc neurons labeled after S1 injections (Jones et al.

After completion of the injection the needle was left in place for 20 minutes. The dorsal column nuclei (DCN) were injected in six animals under direct vision by flexing the monkey's head forward cutting the atlanto-occipital membrane and then making several penetrations with the needle. In a number of cases an injection of the DCN was made in the same animal on the side contralateral to a cerebellar injection. As in these studies it was possible to distinguish a pars rotunda and a pars triangularis in the cuneate nucleus although the injection sites and lesions were rarely confined to a single region of the nucleWhen the macaque brains in the present study were cut in the stereotaxic frontal plane the thalamic nuclei as revealed by the Nissl stain corresponded closely to the cell groups delineated by Olszewski ('52). In other animals it was possible to inject very small amounts of label into small regions of a single cerebellar nucleus. The injection sites were considered to include an intensely labeled center in which silver grains lay densely over cell bodies and their proximal dendrites as well as a less intensely labeled surround in which the distribution of silver grains was sparser and more evenly distributed over cell bodies and neuropil. In the dorsal column nuclei injections were centered in either the gracile or cuneate nucleus but some spread of label into the adjacent dorsal column nucleus was unavoidable. Lesions of the DCN were far more effective than injections in reaching over the entire extent of a single nucleus or including the major portion of both nuclei. Cerebellothalamic projections from dentate and interpositus nuclei In three animals large injections of isotope heavily labeled extensive regions of both dentate and interpositus nuclei.

Dentato-thalamic connections In five animals it was possible to limit the injection sites to small regions of the dentate nucleus with minimal involvement of other cerebellar nuclei. In this animal a horizontal posterior approach was used to inject the ventral lip of the dentate nucleus throughout its caudal half (see Fig. Anterograde labeling of contralateral midbi In another case (MVL 23) (not illustrated) a dorsal injection labeled only the dorsal lip of the dentate in its rostra1 third leaving the interpositus nuclei completely free of label. pain and thalamus after injection shown at top and in Cerebellothalarnic projections from the interpositus nuclei Selective injections were made in the anterior or posterior interpositus nuclei in several animals without involvement of the dentate.

Although the evidence regarding the fastigio-thalamic projection is limited in the present study to a single case it seems likely that the fastigial contribution to the thalamus is sparse in comparison to the dentate and interpositus since only a small number of scattered grain clusters were found in VLc and VPLo after a large injection of the fastigial nucleus. In the present study a comparison of results obtained from injections of both dentate and interpositus with those in which a single nucleus was injected reveals that when the interpositus nuclei are injected there is consistent labeling of VLps VLc and VPLo. Further injections of the interpositus alone failed to elicit labeling of the CL whereas injections including the dentate showed a heavy projection to CL. Both methods also demonstrate that in striking contrast to the patchy aggregates of silver grains observed in the thalamus after cerebellar injections degenerating axon terminals or silver grains are spread fairly uniformly over the medial or lateral VPLc following lesions or injections of the DCN. Therefore the fact that cells in VPLo were labeled after injections of HRP into the motor cortex would suggest that VPLo is a thalamic relay for sensory input from peripheral receptors to motor cortex.""",

Small injections of fluorescent retrograde tracers or anterograde tracers were made that were restricted to single architectonic areas of the cortex. In some cases anterograde tracers have also been injected into the ventral forebrain regions that project to MD in order to directly compare labeled thalamocortical cell populations with the patterns of ventral forebrain afferents or into MD in order to label thalamocortical efferents. Stereotaxic injections of tracers were made guided initially by the atlas of Szabo and Cowan ('84). The exact coordinates of each injection were determined by making electrophysiological recordings through the region of interest to identify brain landmarks such as the boundary between gray and white matter and the ventral surface of the brain which could be used to locate the desired injection site precisely (Russchen et al. Tracer preparation and injection In each animal two to four small injections of different axonal tracers were made into different parts of the forebrain. The retrograde tracers fast blue (FB) and diamidino yellow hydrochloride (DY; Dr. K. G. Illing; 2% in aqueous solution) were injected into the prefrontal or agranular insular cortex; in one case a solution of rhodamine-labeled microspheres (Rh) was also used. In many cases anterograde tracers (3H-leucine or PHA-L) were also injected into the amygdala or other structures in the ventral forebrain. The retrograde tracers were backfilled into pipettes (0.25 mm inner diameter 20-30 pm inner diameter at tip) and then injected immediately with a micropulse air pressure system (Amaral and Price '83). The pipettes remained in place 15-30 min after each injection to prevent spread of tracer up along the pipette track. 3H-leucine (1 mCi/ml; Amersham and New England Nuclear) was evaporated to dryness and then reconstituted in buffer to a concentration of 80 pCi/pl; injections of 25-100 nl were made with the same air pressure injection system. PHA-L (Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin; Vector) was reconstituted in 10 mM phosphate buffer pH 8.0 and injected iontophoretically (Gerfen and Sawchenko '84). All injections except one (OM14 see Fig. Several experiments with injections of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) into MD were also available from earlier studies (Russchen et al. In these cases 30-40 nl of 1% WGA-HRP in saline was injected into MD. Additionally one case in which 3H-leucine was injected into MD and four cases in which WGA-HRP was injected into MD (Russchen et al. RESULTS We shall first present a description of the cytoarchitecture and myeloarchitecture of MD and then the pattern of cell or fiber labeling in MD following small injections of fluorescent retrograde tracers or anterograde tracers in the orbital agranular insular and medial prefrontal cortices. The pattern of thalamocortical label in the prefrontal cortex in a few cases of anterograde tracer injections into MD will then be presented since this closely correlates with the pattern of label from cortical injections. Thalamocortical and corticothalamic projections of MD In all of the experiments reported here small injections of two different retrograde fluorescent tracers were made into separate areas of the cortex and in many cases an additional injection of an anterograde tracer was made into the cortex or a related limbic structure in the ventral forebrain. In all label from 22 different injections were analyzed: 11 in the orbital cortex six in the medial prefrontal cortex three in the agranular insular cortex and two in the depth of the principal sulcus (Fig. Four injections of anterograde tracers were made into structures in the ventral forebrain two into the piriform cortex one into the entorhinal cortex and one into the amygdala (Fig. A number of other cases with anterograde tracer injections into the amygdala were also available from previous studies (Amaral and Price '84; Russchen et al. All of the retrograde tracer injections that were used for analysis were small approximately 1.5 mm in diameter and avoided the white matter deep to the cortex (Fig. These small injections labeled cells in a restricted portion of MD with few labeled cells elsewhere in the nucleus. In contrast injection sites which involved the white matter resulted in a more diffuse pattern of cell labeling in MD. In such cases labeled cells are found throughout much of MD obscuring the overall organization of thalamocortical projections seen with more restricted injections. Experiments with retrogrude tracer injections into the orbital cortex. Following injections of retrograde tracers into the orbital cortex labeled cells are concentrated in MD pars fibrosa and in some cases in the pars paramediana. The thalamocortical projection to area 11 in the rostral orbital cortex is well illustrated by case OM13 which received injections of FB and DY into the rostral and central portions of area 11 (Fig. 41 and by OM5 which received an injection of FB into the caudal part of this area. 6A) while the labeled cells from the more caudal injection in OM5 are located more ventrally in the central part of the pars fibrosa (Fig. Cases OM14 and OM9 received injections into rostral area 12; the injection in OM14 slightly involved area 46 while the injection in OM9 was slightly more caudolateral and avoided area 46 (Fig. Two other injections into the caudomedial part of area 12 (area 120 not illustrated) produced a much more diffuse pattern of label. In OM12 an injection of DY was made into the lateral part of area 13 (Fig. In case OM5 in which DY was injected into a more caudomedial part of area 13 labeled cells are concentrated in paramedian MD with somewhat fewer in fibrosa (Fig. These cells are ventral as well as slightly caudal to the cells labeled by the injection into area 11 in the same case. In a third case (OM8) an injection of FB' limited to area 13b labeled cells in the ventral half of pars fibrosa and pars paramediana (Fig. In case OM15 which received an injection of DY limited to this area (Fig. Experiments with anterograde tracer injections into the orbital cortex. After a PHA-L injection into the caudal part of area 13 (case OM14 Fig. The location and size of the tracer injections in the prefrontal cortex shown on coronal sections (on the left) and on an unfolded map of the cortex (on the right). Note that one to three different tracers were injected in each experiment. In OM12 an injection of 3H-leucine was placed in the posterior piriform cortex. In OM5 an injection of 3H-leucine was No fibers are found in MD pars caudodorsalis or parvicellularis. In OM16 a more rostral injection of 3H- leucine into area 11 (Fig. Experiments with anterograde tracer injections into MD pars fibrosa. Several cases of injections of anterograde tracers (WGA-HRP or 3H-leucine) into MD pars fibrosa are available. Case OM14 received an injection of 3H-leucine that was centered in the lateral half of MD pars fibrosa and avoided the pars parvicellularis pars caudodorsalis and pars paramediana (Fig 10). In OM7 a small injection of PHAL was made into the accessory basal nucleus of the amygdala. Other cases available for analysis received injections of WGA-HRP into MD. The green dots represent cells labeled from an injection of FB into rostral area 11 the black dots represent cells labeled from an injection of DY into a more caudal part of area 11 and the red dots represent anterograde axonal label from an injection of -leucine in area 32. The green dots represent cells labeled from an injection of FB into the caudal part of area 11 the black dots represent cells labeled from an injection of DY in the medial part of area 13 and the red dots represent anterogradely labeled axons from an injection of 3H-leucine in the entorhinal cortex. The crosses represent cells labeled from an injection of DY in the lateral part of area 13 and the circles represent anterogradely labeled axons from an injection of 3H-leucine in the piriform cortex. One of these is PRM17 in which an injection of WGA-HRP was centered upon MD pars fibrosa and slightly involved the pars paramediana and pars parvicellularis (Fig. The green dots represent cells labeled from an injection of rhodamine beads into the fundus of the principal sulcus (in area 461 the black dots represent cells labeled from an injection of DY in the rostral part of area 12 and the short red lines represent anterogradely labeled axons from an injection of PHA-L in area 13. The green dots represent cells labeled from an injection of FB into area 13b the black dots represent cells labeled from an injection of DY in the ventral agranular insular area and the red dots represent anterogradely labeled axons from an injection of 3H-leucine in the same part of the ventral agranular insular area. Experiments with retrograde tracer injections into the agranular insular cortex. Two injections of retrograde tracers into this region illustrate this projection. Case OM8 received an injection of DY into area Iav in addition to the injection of FB into area 13b described above (Fig. Most of the DY labeled cells are concentrated in the ventral part of paramedian MD although a few are also found in pars fibrosa where they are mostly ventral to the cells labeled from the more rostral injection in area 13b of the same case (Fig. The circles represent cells labeled from an injection of DY into area 13a and the dots represent cells labeled from an injection of FB into the dorsal agranular insular area. OM15 received an injection of FB into area Iad (Fig. Experiments with anterograde tracer injections into the agranular insular cortex. Case OMS also received a 3Hleucine injection into area Iav just caudal to the DY injection in the same case (Fig. Experiments with anterograde tracer injections into MD pars paramediana. Our anterograde analysis of the projections of paramedian MD is therefore derived from cases in which tracers were injected into MD pars fibrosa but involved the pars paramediana to varying extents. Of all the available cases PRM17 (see above) received the most medial injection of WGA-HRP heavily involving the pars paramediana as well as MD pars fibrosa (Fig. In contrast the injection in the pars fibrosa in OM14 avoided the pars paramediana. Other cases with injections involving dorsal parts of MD pars fibrosa and MD pars caudodorsalis but not the MD pars paramediana (PRM18; see below) also have little or no label in the agranular insula. Experiments with injections of retrograde tracers into the medial prefrontal cortex. After an injection of FB into area 14 (OM6; Fig. OM7 received an injection of DY limited to the center of area 32 (Fig. In another case (OM4) an injection of FB into a more rostral part of area 32 which slightly involved area 10 (Fig. Finally two cases are available in which DY was injected into different parts of rostral area 24. The injection in OM3 was located approximately 3 mm rostral to the genu of the corpus callosum in area 24b of the nomenclature of Vogt et al. The injection in OM11 was positioned just dorsal to the genu of the corpus callosum in areas 24a and 24b (Fig. Experiments with injections of anterograde tracers in the medial prefrontal cortex. An injection of 3H-leucine into area 32 in OM13 (Fig. This autoradiographic label is consistently dorsolateral and caudal to the cells in MD pars fibrosa that were retrogradely labeled from injections of FB and DY into area 11 in the same case (Figs. Experiments with injections of anterograde tracers in MD pars caicdodorsalis. Injections of anterograde tracers into medial MD label medial prefrontal cortex only if the caudodorsal division of MD is involved in the injection site. In many cases (OM14 and PRM17; see above) labeled afferents in medial prefrontal cortex are particularly sparse and in each case the injection site spared the caudodorsal division of MD. '871 while the WGA-HRP injection is centered upon the dorsolateral part of MD pars fibrosa it also involves the pars caudodorsalis and pars parvicellularis (Fig. This injection resulted in dense anterograde labeling of cortex in the rostral part of the cingulate gyrus including parts of areas 24 32 and 9; equally dense label is found in the depths of the principal sulcus and in the rostral orbital cortex particularly areas 11 and 13b (Fig. In most of the cases studied in which two contrasting fluorescent tracers were injected into different parts of the orbital and medial prefrontal cortex very few double labeled cells were found in MD (roughly 1% of either single labeled cell population). In OM13 where the two injections were approximately 3 mm apart closer than in any other case (in area 11 Fig. Such axonal spread may be elongated in the rostrocaudal dimension because in OM8 in which the injections were placed rostrocaudal to each other and separated by about 5 mm (Fig. In two cases (OM14 and OM161 in which retrograde tracers were injected into this cortical region (Fig. In two other cases (OM 14 and PRM 18) in which injections of anterograde tracers were centered in MD pars fibrosa with little or no involvement of the pars parvicellularis there is a dense band of axonal label in the fundus and ventral bank of the principal sulcus (Figs. Ventral forebrain afferents in MD In many of the experiments described above injections of anterograde tracers were also made into parts of the ventral forebrain that send afferent fibers to MD. An injection of 3Hleucine was made into the rostral entorhinal cortex (into areas ER and EL^ ofAmaral et al. There is only sparse patchy label in areas 13 and 11 and none in the parts of these areas that were injected with retrograde tracers in this same case. Case OM12 in addition to receiving an injection of DY into the lateral part of area 13 (see above) received an injection of 3H-leucine into the posterior piriform cortex (Fig. The labeled axons coincide with a few of the cells in the same region of MD that are retrogradely labeled from the injection of DY into rostrolateral area 13 in the same case but avoid the densest clusters of labeled cells. In other cases tracer injections into more caudal parts of area 13 (OM14 Fig. There is little or no axonal label in the rostrolateral part of area 13 in the region of the retrograde tracer injection. In a few cases we injected anterograde tracers into portions of the amygdaloid complex in order to directly compare afferents in MD from the basal or accessory basal amygdaloid nuclei with cells in MD that project to prefrontal areas. One such case was OM7 in which a restricted PHA-L injection was made into the accessory basal nucleus (Fig. 5) in addition to the DY injection into area 32 described above. Connections of the prefrontal cortex with other thalamic nuclei In addition to retrogradely labeled cells in MD the prefrontal cortical injections also produced cell labeling in other thalamic nuclei.

The dots represent cells labeled from an injection of FB in the area 14. In an earlier autoradiographic analysis of the projections of MD to prefrontal cortex Tobais ('75) also found that only injections of 3H-leucine in the caudomedial portion of MD labeled the medial prefrontal cortex (see also Baleydier and Mauguiere '80; Vogt et al. The crosses represent cells labeled from an injection of DY in area 32 and the thin lines represent anterograde axonal label from an injection of PHA-L in the accessory basal nucleus of the amygdala. Siwek and Pandya (91) also report a case with a tracer injection near the ventromedial corner of the cortex (their area 25) in which the thalamic label is distributed to the dorsal part of medial MD. In agreement with these studies injections of retrograde tracers into the medial prefrontal cortex agranular insula or areas 11 13 13a or 13b of the orbital cortex label very few neurons in parvicellular MD. The dots represent cells labeled from an injection of DY in the area 24. Following a very large retrograde tracer injection in the dorsal bank of the principal sulcus (dorsal area 46) they found labeled cells in the dorsal part of medial MD as well as many cells in lateral MD while a similar injection in the ventrolateral convexity (area 12) labeled cells in lateral as well as medial MD. These have been best demonstrated by the retrograde tracer experiments with injections into the cortex. Comparison of retrogradely labeled cells from injections in rostra1 (stars) and caudal (circles) parts of area 11 (on the left) and anterogradely labeled axons from an injection of 3H-leucine into area 32 (on the right) in OM13. The distribution of anterograde axonal label in PRM18 following an injection of' WGA-HRP in the dorsal part of MD pars fibrosa and the adjacent rostra1 part of the pars caudodorsalis shown on an unfolded map of the frontal cortex (see Fig. The distribution of anterograde and retrograde label in the region of the nucleus submedius (A and B; arrowheads) and in MD (C and D) following an injection of DY into area 13a in OM15 (left) and an injection of 3H-leucine into the piriform cortex in OM12 (right). A subtly different organization is seen with injections of anterograde tracers into MD. 87 for similar patterns of prefrontal corticothalamic cell labeling following injections of retrograde tracers into MD). A corollary of this is that the cells labeled from retrograde tracer injections large enough to cross the bands of thalamocortical afferents should form distinct patches in MD that are separated by unlabeled gaps. Indeed in most cases the retrogradely labeled cells in MD from cortical injections were concentrated in separate clusters (e.g. In another study with larger cortical injections Goldman-Rakic and Porrino (85) reported that neurons in the MD tended to be labeled in cell aggregates. Indeed in PRM17 an injection of WGA-HRP in MD anterogradely labeled relatively few axons in the medial prefrontal cortex (Fig. Because of this it is likely that the apparent lack of thalamocortical reciprocity between MD and medial prefrontal cortex seen in PRM17 and similar experiments is due other factors such as a difference in the sizes of the effective anterograde and retrograde injection sites. Cholinergic cells in the basal forebrain have also been reported to be labeled by injections of retrograde tracers into MD (Parent et al. '88) although it is difficult to rule out that the injections did not involve midline or intralaminar nuclei around MD.

Additionally in an attempt to determine whether there is an intranuclear specificity of projections from individual thalamic nuclei to different subdivisions of the parietal lobe multiple retrograde fluorescent tracers were injected into the rostral to caudal sectors of the parietal lobe of the same animal. Diagram of the lateral and medial surfaces of rhesus monkey cerebral hemispheres to show a composite representation of WGA-HRP injection sites (cases 1 through 12) in the superior and inferior parietal lobules as well as in the cortex of the intraparietal sulcus. Four penetrations each delivering 0.5 pl of tracer (total 2.0 pl) were made at each injection site. The order of the dye injections was altered in the second case with respect to the first so as to verify the accuracy of the results as the reliability and relative intensity of neuronal transport of each dye appear to be different. In both cases (13 and 14) the left hemisphere was injected in the SPL and the right hemisphere in the IPL. The animals were anesthetized and the cortical injection sites located as described for the WGA-HRP cases. Thus an additional 12 parietal injection sites were available for analysis. 1A) were identified by inspection of the sulcal pattern and two closely adjacent 0.05 pl injections of 7.5% WGA-HRP in an aqueous solution were made under direct visual guidance with a one microliter Hamilton syringe with a microdrive attachment.

A small amount of spread of the injection to the lower bank was observed as well. The WGA-HRP injections in case 3 were placed in area PEc in the caudalmost portion of the SPL (Figs.

Fluorescent tracer injections Case 13 -left hemisphere. Three separate injections of retrograde fluorescent dyes were placed in the left superior parietal lobule of a single animal and the resulting retrogradely labelled neurons in the thalamus were charted (Fig. Rhodamine latex microspheres (beads) were placed in the rostral area PE; diamidino yellow (DY) was injected more caudally into area PEc; and fast blue (FB) was injected into the medial convexity of the parietal lobe in area PGm. The distribution of neurons labelled with beads (shown as red dots) in the thalamus following injection of rostral area PE was similar to that observed in case 1. The fast blue injection in the medial parietal convexity area PGm resulted in intense labelling (shown as blue dots). A prominent feature in this case was the overall pattern of dorsoventral lamination of the labelled neurons noted particularly in the LP and pulvinar nuclei following injection of different parts of the superior parietal lobule. Thus neurons labelled with beads after rostral PE injections were located ventrally in the LP nucleus and had a ventral predominance in the PO nucleus. Neurons labelled with FB following PGm injections were located most dorsally in the LP and PO nuclei. Neurons labelled with DY following injections in PEc occupied an intermediate position between these two collections. The bulk of the labelled neurons from all the injections appeared to lie mostly in the lateral regions of the thalamus. Three separate injections of fluorescent retrograde tracers were made in the left superior parietal lobule of a single rhesus monkey cerebral hemisphere.

The FB injection in rostral PE resulted in labelling (shown as blue dots) resembling case 1 and the bead injections in case 13-left hemisphere being noted most prominently in the PO and LP nuclei. The thalamic labelling (shown as red dots) following bead injections into area PEc was similar to case 3 and the DY label in case 13-left hemisphere being concentrated in LP and in the PO nucleus to a smaller degree. The DY injections in area PGm resulted in labelled neurons (shown as green dots) clustered at the junction of the LP PO PL and VPLc nuclei. The rostrally placed injections (FB) resulted in labelled neurons ventrally within the LP and PO nuclei; the PGm injections (DY) produced labelled neurons dorsally within the PO nucleus; and the placement of beads in area PEc resulted in labelled neurons dorsal to the FB in the LP nucleus and in an intermediate position in the PO nucleus. In this hemisphere three injections of fluorescent retrograde tracers were placed in the inferior parietal lobule. Beads were injected rostrally in area PF; DY in the intermediate regions at rostral area PG; and FB in caudalmost IPL area Opt (Fig. Diamidino yellow injection into rostral area PG produced thalamic labelling resembling that found in cases 9 and 10. Diagrams illustrating cases 3 and 4 with the WGA-HRP injections in areas PEc and caudal PEa respectively and the distribution of labelled neurons in thalamus. Thalamic labelling following the injection in Opt of FB was basically similar to cases 11 and 12. The ventral to dorsal arrangement of labelled thalamic neurons in this case according to the rostrocaudal location of the parietal injections was quite striking. The bulk of the labelled neurons from all three injection sites in the IPL were concentrated in a medial position in the thalamus when compared to the labelled neurons from the SPL. As in the previous case the IPL of a single hemisphere was injected with three different fluorescent retrograde tracers. In this case however FB was placed in the rostral IPL area PP; beads were injected into area PG; and DY was placed in caudalmost IPL area Opt (Fig. Following FB injection into area PF dense concentrations of labelled neurons were present in the PO nucleus as well as in PM to a lesser degree. The paucity of label following this injection could be a result of problems inherent in the transport properties of the rhodamine latex microspheres. Despite this the location of label in PM resembled the DY injection in case 13-right hemisphere and the WGA-HRP cases 9 and 10. Diamidino yellow injection in the caudal IPL area Opt resulted in labelling predominantly in the dorsal portion of the PM and to a lesser degree the PL nuclei. The intermediate to medial position within the thalamus of the labelled neurons from all the IPL injections is consistent with the Case 14- right hemisphere. Diagrams illustrating cases 5 and 6 with the WGA-HRP injections respectively in areas PGm and the inferior aspect of areas 1 and 2 and the distribution of labelled neurons in thalamus. Possible overlap between these projecting areas could not be assessed from our material because opposite hemispheres were chosen for SPL and TPL injections. Diagrams illustrating cases 7 and 8 with the WGA-HRP injections in areas PF and the dorsal part of PFG respectively and the distribution of labelled neurons in thalamus. However in our material with the injection restricted to areas 1 and 2 we failed to confirm the observations made by these authors that the rostral pulvinar projects to area 2.

It was noted that rostral and caudal injections into the medial area 6 resulted in different thalamic labeling: The rostral portion was found to be related mainly with VApc area X and VLc the central portion with VLo and the caudal portion with VLc/VLo. With injections of the caudal and middle portions of the SMA we obtained results which were similar to those of Schell and Strick (1984). However injection of the lectin-bound enzyme HRP in a rostral portion of the SMA clearly also labeled area X of Olszewski and VLc i.e. In 6 monkeys various portions of the SMA were injected (3 ARG 3 WGA-HP P); in 2 monkeys the arm and the face areas of the precentral cortex were injected with WGA-HRP and in 1 monkey the hindlimb-tail area was injected with labeled aminoacids. Details of the injections and survival times are listed in Table 1. Total volumes of 0.2-1.5 ~tl were pressureinjected with a 1 Ixl syringe (2 cases) or through a glass capillary (2 cases). After 2 or more days of postfixation blocks of the brain containing the injections and the thalamus were cut coronally on a freezing microtome (50 ~tm sections). HRP-Histochemistry A 10% solution of WGA-HRP (Sigma) was pressure-injected through a glass-capillary in volumes of 0.2-0.3 ~tl. The sites of injections in the precentral cortex were chosen according to the lowest threshold points for eliciting movements (trains of 12 pulses at 330 Hz applied directly to the cortical surface). One block was processed within 2 days the 2 other blocks were frozen at-80 ~ C in 2-methyl buthane which made it possible to process this material at Table 1 93 Experiment Area injected Applicated solution total survival quantity activity time ~tCi (days) 82-43 anterior SMA WGA-HRP 10% 80-153 anterior SMA 3H Leucine- + area 24 Proline (L-P) 7%47 middle third 3H L-P of SMA 80-152 posterior SMA 3H L-P 82-15 middle third WGA-HRP 10% of SMA + area 24 82-16 posterior SMA WGA-HRP 10% + area 4 (tail area) 79-46 preeentral tail 3H L-P area + area 24 83-82 precentral WGA-HRP 10% arm area 84-01 precentral WGA-HRP 10%o face area 0.3 ~tl 15 rd 135 0.2 ~tL 24 1.0 ~tl 90 0.8 r 0.3 ~l 0.2 ~1 24 0.4 ~tl 0.4 ~tl later stages without apparent loss of enzyme activity. The reconstructed spheres of injections as shown in the illustrations included the centre of the injections with an evenly dark background but excluded the surrounding volume with prominently labeled perikarya and the faint halo (Mesulam 1982). The general pattern was in agreement with previous observations in monkey material with motor cortex injections of HRP (Jones et al. 1983b) and SMA injections (Schell and Strick 1984; Jfirgens 1984). In brief the relatively large injections produced labeling in a curved 'lamella' or 'slab' which extended rostro-caudally through the VL complex of the thalamus. On coronal sections patches of labeling can be distinguished especially with the smaller injections. The more rostral the injection the more labeling occurred in medial cell groups of the MD nucleus Pcn and CL. In the following the results from injections in various rostro-caudal portions of the SMA are grouped together (cf. The diameter of the injected sphere was about 3 mm. A similarly placed WGA-HRP injection in case 82-15 was somewhat larger and encroached on the ventral bank of the cingulate sulcus. B Sphere of the injection in the SMA (see also Fig. A Relatively small injection confined to the upper bank of the cingulate sulcus bordering granular frontal cortex. The injection sphere was largely confined to the most rostral portion of the agranular medial cortex but may 'have spread slightly into the most posterior portion of medial area 9 (Fig. On the right are outlines of coronal sections with the core zone (crosshatched) and the lightly stained surrounding halo (hatched) of the injection site. Note that the effective injection zone was probably confined to the agranular cortex. In comparison to the case with an injection in the middle third of SMA the maximum of labeling was shifted from VLo to area X which now seems to be the most prominently labeled subnucleus. The injection in the ARG case 80-153 was small; in its a-p position it corresponded to the case described above but encroached on area 24 of the anterior cingulate cortex. VLo was however hardly labeled in this case with the small injection. The sphere of injection was just rostral to area 4 with the tail and hindlimb representation. The corresponding ARG case (79--46) had a slightly more rostral injection which avoided area 4 but instead invaded definitely the ventral bank of the cingulate sulcus. Comparison with area 4 injections Face area injection (84-01). Arm area injection (83-82). The injection made under electro-physiological control provided a labeling pattern which was very similar to that of the face case. There was also some VLo involvement just lateral to area X. Leg-tail area injection (80-152). A rather small injection (sphere of about 1 mm diameter) of tritiated aminoacids may have involved mainly the tail area of the primary motor cortex. With respect to the sources of afferents to area X we found that a precentral face area injection labeled a lamella in the most lateral portion of area X (besides more lateral territory). It demonstrates that in all our SMA injections of WGA-HRP with a long survival time transcellular labeling occurred contralaterally in the deep cerebellar nuclei.""",

Following appropriate survival periods (2-4 days after the HRP injections 14 days after the fluorescent dye injections) the animals were deeply anesthetized and perfused through the ascending aorta with saline a mixture of aldehydes (I-4% paraformaldehyde 0.2- 1.25% glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer) and a series of phosphate-buffered sucrose solutions. Adjacent series of sections were collected and pro- cessed to reveal the injected substances the chemo- architecture and the cytoarchitecture (cresyl violet staining). Connectional findings The various tracers injected in the cortex remained well within the boundaries of the various cortical regions (Fig. 1) with the partial exception of the HRP injection in M I that reached in addition to the or- bitofrontal cortex the most ventral part of the medial prefrontal surface adjacent to it. In the 3 cases with HRP injections (MI-M3) the HRP-reaction product was present in the thalamus in both neuronal somata and terminals. Both types of labeling usually overlapped in the hemithalamus ipsilaterai to the injections giving the labeled regions a bright and dense appearance in the low power photomicrographs of Figs. Isolated HRP- labeled terminals were most clearly observed in the hemithalamus opposite to the injected hemispheres close to the midline. The close match between the distributions of terminal and neuronal labeling in the hemithalamus ipsilateral to the HRP injections in cases MI-M3 is in keeping with findings illustrated by Preuss and Goldman-Rakic (1987 their Fig. 2) after large injections of the same tracer in the prefrontal cortex.

The zone labeled after the STP injections only partially overlaps the dark AChE patch of PulM (Figs.

In addition the thalamic chemoarchitectonic patterns observed in other cases from our laboratory (not includ- ed in the present report) with cortical injections of several additional tracers in various cortical areas do not differ from those reported here. Finally in the present cases no histochemical differences were observed be- tween the hemithalamus of the injected hemispheres and the opposite hemithalamus as illustrated in Figs. Examples are the population of labeled neurons in VAvra resulting from the parietal and temporal injections which did not fill the entire surface of that nuclear subdivision (Fig. 3) a patch of HRP labeling surpassing the lateral border of MDm after the orbital prefrontal injection (Figs. 4AB) or isolated labeled neurons lying outside the AChE-rich patch of the dorsomedial PulM after the same injection (Figs. The reason for these differences is presumably that we failed to inject the precise cortical surface area linked to the chemo-specific thalamic fields. Thus the parietal target of VAvm might encroach either the posterior end of area 7a or the adjacent area 7ip in the intraparietal sulcus or both or perhaps additional areas which were not involved by any of the injections of cases M3 and M4 (Fig. 1981) ap- pears larger than that covered by the Fast Blue injection in case M4 (Fig. Had a wider part of this area been injected a wider region of VAvm might hold the transported dye. In the same vein we contend that the large surface of prefrontal cortex covered by the HRP injection in M l is a clue to the extended thalamic label- ing observed in this case.""",

In four animals the injection was made without physiological control. In these animals the injection site was in the posterior bank of the arcuate sulcus. The location of the injection was based on previous physiological (Woolsey et al. Once the appropriate cortical site was chosen WGA-HRP was pressure injected in all animals but one. The tracer was injected over a period of 20 minutes 1.5 mm below the pial surface with a 1-p1 Hamilton microsyringe. The amount of WGA-HRP (4% in distilled water) delivered was 0.08 pl in a single injection in nine monkeys; two animals received an injection of 0.1 p1. One monkey (IT4-7) was callosotomized under aseptic conditions 1 week before tracer injection. Each hemisphere of this split-brain animal received a single injection of enzyme.

Evidence that the injection was limited to that part of area F1 that controls isolated finger movements was also provided by the lack of labelling in the contralateral hemisphere.

J.B.) ABSTRACT Anterograde tracers (tritiated leucine proline fucose; WGA-HRP) were injected into sites within the frontal eye fields (FEF) of nine macaque monkeys. Low thresholds ( < 50 PA) for electrically evoking saccadic eye movements were used to locate injection sites in four monkeys. Cases were grouped according to the amplitude of saccades evoked or predicted at the injection site. Dorsomedial prearcuate injection sites where large saccades were elicited were classified as lFEF cases whereas ventrolateral prearcuate sites where small saccades were evoked were designated sFEF cases. One control case was injected in the medial postarcuate area 6. First cortical lesions or tracer injections in most of the previous studies have centered on the easily accessible convexity of the arcuate sulcus (e.g. Thus most studies have either avoided the anterior bank of the arcuate sulcus where the lowthreshold FEF lies or traced its connections by using large lesions or injections that also included cortical areas outside the FEF. Furthermore the folding of the prearcuate gyrus varies considerably from monkey to monkey making it difficult to inject the low-threshold FEF on the basis of sulcal landmarks without physiological verification. The topographic representation of saccade amplitudes in the prearcuate cortex enabled us to place our injections in FEF subareas where large and small saccades were elicited designated lFEF and sFEF respectively. In nine macaque monkeys unilateral injections of tritiated tracers (3H-proline -leucine -fucose; 0.2-0.5 pl of 150-200 pCi/pl; individually or in cocktails) were made into the FEF. One of these monkeys also received an injection of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HFtP). In the first four cases FEF injection sites were identified with microstimulation (see Physiological methods below). The remaining five cases were deeply anesthetized with Nembutal and tracer injections were made into the approximate location of the FEF in the anterior wall of the arcuate sulcus with aseptic surgical technique. A control injection of WGA-HRP was made outside the FEF in postarcuate area 6 dorsomedial to the genu of the arcuate sulcus (case MIC). For ease of comparison the cases were grouped according to the amplitude of saccades evoked or predicted at each injection site. 2microstim = FEF injection site guided by microstimulation 3Brainstem cut in sagittal sections. Examples of lFEF and sFEF injections are illustrated in Figures 1 and 2. The injections in these cases were considered within the FEF because saccadic eye movements were evoked at the center of the injection site and because the dense cores of the injections were located within the region of large (22-36 pm diameter) layer V pyramidal cells along the anterior wall of the arcuate sulcus. Other injection sites are illustrated in Figure 4. Although the injection site in these cases included cortical area 46 (Walker '40) on the crest of the prearcuate gyrus or area 6 on the postarcuate wall most of the data derived from them are consistent with the results from lFEF and sFEF cases GNA and TRB. In the two monkeys injected with WGA-HRP an adjacent series of every fifth section was processed for HRP histochemistry with tetramethyl benzidine (TMB) chromagen (Mesulam '82). On the day of tracer injection the monkeys were lightly anesthetized with ketamine the dura was infiltrated with 2% lidocaine and epinephrine and then incised. At the time of the injection the microstimulating electrode was withdrawn and a microsyringe containing tracer was lowered to the same intracortical coordinates as the electrode. Labeled axons passing from FEF injection sites to the striatum entered the caudate nucleus at or slightly anterior to the genu of the internal capsule. Saccadic eye move- ments elicited by microstimulation within the injected area are shown in plot in the upper right. The most rostral labeling in the striatum in all cases resulted from a tracer injection in dorsomedial lFEF (case PER). Labeling in the striatum and claustrum from an injection into area 6 medial to the genu of the arcuate sulcus (MIC) appeared contiguous with the labeling from sFEF injections. The label was concentrated in the caudal and ventral parts of the nucleus in both lFEF and sFEF cases but it did not appear to be topographically organized with respect to the injection site. Labeled axon terminals from the dorsomedial postarcuate area 6 injection (MIC) were more centrally located in the subthalamic nucleus than axon terminals labeled by FEF injections. The density of autoradiographic labeling from tracer injections in FEF was much less in the paracentral or central lateral nuclei than in nuclear areas immediatley adjacent to the internal medullary lamina (Figs. Label from lFEF injections was located more rostrally and dorsally in the rostral thalamus than that from sFEF injections. Saccadic eye movements elicited by microstimulation within the injected area are shown in the upper right. Labeled patches were also found in VL and VPLo in the case with the dorsomedial postarcuate area 6 injection (MIC) but these patches were more ventrolaterally distributed than the patches in VL and VPLo in cases MCD and HNR. Although cortical areas adjoining FEF also received small amounts of tracer the involvement of these areas varied from case to case but portions of the FEF were injected in all cases.

Tracer injections in lFEF characteristically resulted in label over this subdivision of MD.

The injections were aimed at the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus or the areas that project to it including the amygdala the substantia innominata and the prefrontal cortex. The stereotaxic coordinates for the injections were initially taken from the atlas of the fascicularis monkey by Szabo and Cowan ('841 and then adjusted on the basis of electrophysiological recordings. This was used both to map olfactory responses in MD (in eight experiments) and to provide further guidance for stereotaxic injections of tracers in either the thalamus or the basal forebrain and amygdala (see below). The most useful physiological indicators for tracer injections in the thalamus were the lack of spontaneous activity above the dorsal surface of the thalamus and responses to olfactory bulb stimulation. For injections aimed at the magnocellular basal forebrain the most useful indicators were the decreased spontaneous activity within the anterior commissure and the approach of the electrode to the ventral surface of the brain. When the appropriate coordinates had been determined the tracer was injected through glass micropipettes with internal tip diameters varying from 7 pm to 10 pm using an air-pressure injection system (Amaral and Price '83). Two cases in which WGA-HRP injections were placed in the magnocellular basal forebrain (PRM 4 and PRM 6) according to the procedure described above for retrograde tracing experiments were also available for analysis.

Several experiments in which anterograde tracers were injected into some of the basal forebrain areas that contained labeled cells in the retrograde tracing experiments will then be presented to demonstrate the terminal distribution of the projections to MD. Finally an experiment will be described in which injections of two fluorescent tracers were made into different parts of the orbital cortex in order to compare the pattern of origin of the thalamocortical projections from MD with the pattern of inputs to the nucleus. Retrograde tracing experiments: Injections in MD Six experiments are available in which WGA-HRP injections were placed in different portions of MD (Fig. In three of these (PRM 14 17 and 181 the injection sites are centered in the medial part of MD at different rostrocaudal levels; in PRM 18 the injection also involves the adjacent part of MD1. In the two other cases (PRM 15 and PRM lo) the injections are centered in the intralaminar paracentral nucleus and involve the ventral and lateral portions of the rostral MD. In one experiment (PRM 21) the injection site is centered dorsolaterally in MD and involves portions of both its medial and lateral divisions as well as the intralaminar nucleus centralis superior. The injection is relatively large and is centered at about the midrostrocaudal level of MDm; it also slightly involves MD1 and the midline thalamic nuclei. A comparison of experiment PRM 17 with the other cases with smaller injections suggests that the projections from the basal forebrain and temporal lobe structures to MDm are spatially organized. 9 in which the injection is in the more rostra1 part of MDm has relatively more cells in the amygdaloid complex and fewer cells in the ventral pallidum or the temporal cortex. Experiment PRM 18 (not illustrated) with an injection in the more caudal part of MDm contains relatively more labeled cells in the temporal cortex and fewer cells in the amygdaloid complex. 8 lo) which have injections in the dorsal part of MDM contain more labeled cells in the medial part of the substantia innominata especially the ventral pallidum than in the lateral part of this region. PRM 10 (not illustrated) in which the injection is in the ventral edge of MDm has many positive cells in the lateral substantia innominata but very few in the ventral pallidum. In this case the injection site involves the dorsal part of both MDm and MD1. Many retrogradely labeled cells are observed in the medial aspect of the substantia innominata (including the ventral pallidum) with a smaller number in cells in the superior colliculus the vestibular nuclei and found in the pyramidal cell layer of the hippocampus and subiculum in this brain but this may be due largely to involvement of the fornix by the injection since few labeled cells are seen in this lamina in the more discretely injected cases. Since the injection in PRM 17 also sIightly The patterns of retrograde cell labeling in the frontal involves the midline thalamus it is possible that these cells cortex will be described in the three experiments with injecwere labeled from there and not from MD (see also Price tions of WGA-HRP that mainly involve MDm (PRM 14 and Amaral '81).

In PRM 17 (large mid-rostrocaudal injection) there is substantial large cell labeling at the frontal pole and cells are labeled in area 14 most of area 10 except the frontal pole area 32 and the rostroventral part of area 24. Experiment PRM 18 (caudal injection with slight involvement of MDl) has labeled cortical cells that tend to be located more caudally than in PRM 17 (Fig. In experiment PRM 21 (dorsal injection involving parts of MDm and MDI) most of the labeled cells are located on the dorsolateral surface of the cortex in areas 9 10 and 46 with some cells on the medial surface in areas 24 and 32. In experiment PRM 10 (rostroventral injection also involving the paracentral and submedial nuclei) most of the labeled cells are located ventral to the principal sulcus on the lateral surface of the frontal lobe and on the adjacent part of the orbital surface. The largest number of cells are Retrograde labeling from injections in MDI. The distribution of retrogradely labeled cells in PRM 17 in which a large injection of WGAHRP was centered in MDm with slight involvement of MDI. In PRM 15 (extreme lateral injection) most of the retrogradely filled cells are found in area 8 along the rostra1 bank of the arcuate sulcus and in area 6 near the precentral dimple. In the experiments with injections which either selectively involve MD (PRM 14 PRM 17 PRM 18) or involve MD plus the intralaminar nuclei (PRM 15 and PRM 21) there is very little if any anterograde labeling in layer I. However in PRM 10 in which the ventromedial nucleus is included in the injection site (as well as MD the submedial nucleus and the paracentral nucleus) there is substantial anterograde labeling in layer I of much of the frontal cortex. A similar pattern of anterograde label in layer I is seen in experiment PRM 12 (not illustrated) in which an injection of tritiated amino acids was placed slightly more rostrally and medially than the WGA-HRP injection in PRM 10 and involves the ventral part of MD together with the adjacent ventromedial and midline intralaminar nuclei. The pattern of labeling in the frontal cortex is different following each of the injections into MD. For example PRM 14 and PRM 18 have injections at different rostrocaudal levels of MDm and there are labeled cells and axons in the orbital and medial prefrontal cortical areas in both cases. Darkfield photomicrographs of cells retrogradely labeled with WGA-HRP from injections in MDm taken from areas TE and TG of the temporal cortex (A and B) the subiculum (C) the entorhinal cortex (D) the periamygdaloid cortex (E) and the amygdaloid complex (F). Anterograde tracing experiments scribed for several experiments in which injections of tritiated amino acids or WGA-HRP were made into the patches of denser labeling are surrounded by more lightly labeled areas and within the patches the silver grains are Injections in the substantia innominata The Patterns Of anteroeade labeling in MD Will be de- in small clusters (e.g. The terminal field labeled from each injection generally consists of two to four distinct dorsoventrally oriented columns that occupy different parts of MDm in different experiments. Within each of these columns Two experiments are available with injections of tritiated amino acids in the substantia innominata (PRM 11 and PRM 19 Fig. In experiment PRM 19 the injection is centered rostrally in the ventral pallidum with some involvement of the nucleus accumbens. The distribution of retrogradely labeled cells in PRM 14 in which an injection of WGA-HRP was made into the anterior part of MDm. In experiment PRM 11 the injection site is located laterally in the rostra1 substantia innominata around the anterolateral part of the nucleus basalis of Meynert. Three additional experiments are available in which WGA-HRP was injected into the magnocellular basal forebrain on one or both sides (PRM 2 PRM 4 and PRM 6; see Russchen et al. %a for illustrations of the injection sites). In PRM 4 a single injection is centered rostromedially in the venral pallidum. The distribution of retrogradely labeled cells in PRM 15 in which an injection of WGA-HRP was made into MDI and the adjacent paracentral intralaminar nucleus. In PRM 2 and PRM 6 bilateral WGA-HRP injections were placed in more lateral parts of the substantia innominata. Furthermore in PRM 2 the injection on the left side is located more medially than the injection on the right and the anterograde label in MDm is concentrated slightly more ventromedially on the left than on the right side. Injections in the amygdaloid complex Several experiments are available with injections of tritiated leucine into the amygdaloid complex (Fig. In DM 34-lt the injection site is centered in the periamygdaloid cortex (Fig. The distribution of retrogradely labeled cells in PRM 21 in which an injection of WGAHRP involved the dorsal part of MDm and MDl. sion of the basal nucleus (but not the periamygdaloid cortex) The rostra1 column is much larger and more heavily la- is again involved in the injection site (Fig. On the contralateral (right) side of DM 34 an injection was placed at the rostral edge of the amygdaloid complex involving the anterior amygdaloid area portions of the lateral nucleus and the magnocellular division of the basal nucleus. In both experiments the injections are centered in the parvicellular division of the accessory basal nucleus with additional involvement of the amygdalohippocampal area and the posterior cortical nucleus (in DM 111 or the posterior cortical nucleus and the dorsal portion of the periamygdaloid cortex (in PRM 1; Fig. A third experiment (DM 27 not illustrated) has an injection that selectively involves the amygdalohippocampal area; in this case as in DM 11 patches of silver grains are found in the dorsomedial part of MDm and there is also a small separate patch of label in the caudal part of the nucleus. In the third group of experiments (DM 28-lt DM 19-lt and -rt and DM 29-It and -rt) the injection sites are in the deeper amygdaloid nuclei and the axonal label tends to be concentrated in the ventral or ventrolateral part of MDm. In DM 19-rt and DM 294 the injections are centered in the lateral nucleus (Fig. A similar pattern of axonal label is also found in DM 29-rt where the injection site is centered in the magnocellular division of the accessory basal nucleus although a number of weakly labeled patches are present more medially and dorsally in MDm. In DM 28-lt in which the injection site is centered in the caudal part of the magnocellular basal nucleus (Fig. DM 19-lt with an injection at the rostral pole of the basal nucleus (Fig. Most of the experiments in this group have bilateral injections into different parts of the amygdaloid complex and thus part of the anterograde labeling in MDm might be attributed to the contralateral injection. It is less important in DM 28 since the injection on the right side of this brain is placed in the central nucleus which projects to the midline thalamic nuclei but not to MD (Price and Amaral '81; Aggleton and Mishkin '84; see also the retrograde tracing experiments described above). Furthermore in DM 28 and other cases with unilateral injections (PRM 1 DM 11 DM 27 and DM 31) the contralateral labeling in MDm is relatively weak and its pattern of distribution is the mirrorimage of the densest labeling on the ipsilateral side. In the fourth group of experiments in which the injections are centered in the central and medial amygdaloid nuclei (DM 28-rt PRM 3-rt PRM 3-lt and DM 18) virtually no anterograde labeling is found in MD. Only in DM 28-rt are there patches of light anterograde labeling in MD and these may be attributed to the contralateral injection in the magnocellular division of the basal nucleus (DM 28-It). There is substantial label over the ipsilateral midline thalamic nuclei on the right side of DM 28 that originates from the injection in the central nucleus (Price and Amaral '81).

The central and medial nuclei provide injection centered slightly rostromedially to that in DM 38 little if any projection to MD. while the injection in experiment MF 6 is located in the caudomedial part of the entorhinal cortex. Three experiments are available in which tritiated amino The label occupies slightly different positions in the three acid were injected in the entorhinal cortex (Fig. The experiments; it is more dorsal and rostral in the expermost extensive labeling in MD is found in experiment DM iment with the most rostral injection (DM 25) and most ven38 in which the injection is placed laterally in the rostral tral and caudal in the case with the most caudal injection half of the entorhinal cortex.

For each brain the figure at the top left shows the injection site while the figures at the right and bottom are drawn from 3-D computer reconstructions of serial sections through MD seen from frontal and anterodorsolateral aspects in order to illustrate the distribution of labeled axons within the nucleus. In another experiment (DM 42) the injection is placed in the perirhinal cortex in the lateral bank of the rhinal sulcus (areas 35 and 36). In DM 46 multiple injections of tritiated amino acids were placed in the cortex at the anterior pole of the temporal lobe (Fig. Two other experiments with smaller injections in the temporal pole (not illustrated) have essentially similar patterns of labeling in MD. Course of the fibers entering MD As described above in the cases with injections in the substantia innominata especially the anteromedial part of the ventral pallidum (e.g. In contrast the experiments with injections in the temporal lobe structures contain labeled fibers that appear to enter the thalamus via a ventral route. This was especially obvious with injections into the temporal pole but several labeled fibers could be seen to enter MD ventrally following amygdaloid and entorhinal injections. These observations are also supported by another experiment (PRM 13) in which an injection of WGA-HRP was fortuitously placed in and 10969861 1987 2 Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.902560202 by Rwth Aachen Hochschulbibliothe Wiley Online Library on [12/09/2023].

The distribution of axonal label within MD in DM 34-It in which a large injection of [3H]- amino acids was made into the basal and accessory basal amygdaloid nuclei. In this brain the distribution of retrogradely labeled cells in the substantia innominata is similar to that following the injections into MDm. But no labeled cells are found in the temporal cortical areas and the distribution of labeled cells in the amygdala (in the anterior cortical nucleus medial nucleus and amygdalohippocampal area) can be attributed to involvement of rostral midline and anterior thalamic nuclei in the injection site.

However while Aggleton and Mishkin ('84) reported retrogradely labeled cells in the entorhinal and perirhinal cortices following injections of WGAsGntia innominata following injections of WGA-HRP into the medial thalamus but apparently attributed this to involvement of structures adjacent to MD. The distribution of cells in MD in experiment PRM 19 labeled from injections of fluorescent tracers true blue (solid dots) and diamidino yellow (open circles) into the anterior part of the orbital cortex. A further striking feature of all the experiments is that the cortical field that is interconnected with the injected portion of MD tends to be arrayed in irregular strips which may interdigitate with those labeled in other experiments. Goldman-Rakic and Porrino ('85) have recently published a study of patterns of retrograde cell labeling in MD following injections of WGA-HRP or fluorescent dyes into the frontal cortex. As in the one experiment reported here in which fluorescent tracers were injected into the orbital cortex Goldman-Rakic and Porrino found that the cells in MD that can be labeled from restricted areas of the cortex are distributed in clusters. GoldmanRakic and Porrino used relatively large injections which labeled a continuous column of cells throughout the anteroposterior extent of MD. But in the experiment presented here in which relatively small injections were used the labeled cells are distributed in two large groups that are separated by a zone free of labeled cells and the more caudal group is smaller and more dorsally located.

Double-labeled thalamic neurons projecting to sensorimotor cortex were rarely seen in mature macaques even when the injection sites were only 1-1.5 mm apart implying that their terminal arborizations were quite restricted horizontally. Probably the main reason for this uncertainty about the patterns of projection of thalamocortical neurons is that in most studies the thalamic input to only one cortical area (the injection site of the enzyme) could be mapped in each experimental animal. Four or five distinguishable fluorescent dyes were injected into separate localized zones of cortex in each animal. The dyes used had similar retrograde transport rates so that the differently labeled neuron somas could all be identified at the same time 12-16 days after their cortical injection. Commonly these distributions overlapped and when this occurred the presence or absence of two dyes in individual cells (""double labeling"") indicated if these neurons projected to one or both injected cortical fields. 2-D maps were constructed of the thalamic territories within which the somas of neurons projecting to each cortical injection site were located. Hence the projection patterns reported here reflect the findings obtained in the thalamic maps of cells labeled by more than 80 cortical injections in 19 animals. surgicalprocedures Each monkey was first anesthetized with an intramuscular injection of ketamine hydrochloride (10 mgkg body weight) and Xylazine (2 mgkg). Following the intracortical injection of the fluorescent dyes the dura was sutured or repaired using thin silastic membrane and the scalp wound closed. Each of these dyes is retrogradely transported within the axon from the injection site to the neuron soma where it can be visualized 2 weeks following injection. Each dye was injected into the cortex 1-1.5 mm below its surface using a glass micropipette (tip diameter of 50--100 pm) attached to a Hamilton syringe. At 12-16 days following the cortical injection each monkey was deeply anesthetized with ketamine and perfused through the left cardiac ventricle with the following solutions: (1) 0.9% sodium chloride in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.2 (2) 6% paraformaldehyde in the same buffer and (3) a solution of 30% sucrose in the above buffered fixative. The dye injection sites in each monkey are tabulated in Fig. Each dye injection site was reconstructed by plotting the appropriate fluorescence zone in every third serial section that traversed it (Fig. The central zone of each injection site for all five dyes was easily identified either as necrotic or intensely fluorescent regions. The latter outer boundary at the just-visible limit of tissue fluorescence was used to define each injection zone. Since all injection volumes were small (Table 21 spread of the injected dye into the subcortical white matter was uncommon and when it did happen the resulting retrograde transport of tracer was interpreted with caution. 17 and 191 a row of these injections were made to extend the zone of uptake of dye. Adjacent cresyl-violetstained sections of the cortex were used to identify the cyto-architectonic field(s) into which each dye was injected. Intracortical injection sites. Locations of the cortical dye injections in each of the eight mature macaques plotted onto a dorsal view of the cerebrum. Two injection sites were used in supplementary motor cortex (SMA) one being labeled with the star. A: Cross sections of injection sites within cortex visualized by fluorescence microscopy. FB (Fast Blue): sections through outer part of injection site (upper) and the necrotic central zone (lower). DY (Diadimo Yellow): injection site with central necrotic zone. EB (Evans Blue) and RLM (Rhodamine Latex Microspheres): injection sites that normally lack a necrotic core. The procedure for correlating the data obtained in different monkeys was to sum the total number of fluorescent neuron somas within each thalamic nucleus that were labeled by the injection(s) made into a particular cortical field. Three-dimensional reconstructions of the separate distributions of labeled thalamic cells projecting to individual dye injection sites (commonly about 1 mm3) in the sensorimotor cortex were made using VersaCAD 5.4 software (VersaCAD Corp. CAI running on an Everex STEP 386120 (Everex Systems Inc. CAI. In the present experiments the location of each injection site is described in terms of relevant cytoarchitectural features and of surface landmarks. We used multi-unit electrophysiological mapping of the hand and finger representation in cortical area 3bll in a couple of the early experiments with the aim of improving the definition of the sites of dye injection. However this procedure was discontinued for the following reasons: (1) the procedure at best improves the specification of the injection site in the anesthetized macaque only for areas 3b and 1 and not for areas 2 and 5 nor for any precentral injections (2) experimentally useful maps of finger and hand representation in areas 3b and 1 require considerable detail (Nelson et al. '80) and greatly prolong the surgical exposure of the cortex to be injected and (3) even mapping areas 3b and 1 is not a reliable procedure in the anesthetized newborn or prematurely delivered macaques used in the following paper (Darian-Smith et al. We decided that in the present experiments the additional information about dye injection sites that would be obtained by multiunit mapping of the postcentral cortex was outweighed by the disadvantages of the procedure. These dyes when injected into the cortex at the one operation proved to be reliable in labeling thalamic neuron somas 12-16 days later although FG did fail to do so in a few experiments for no obvious reason. FG and FB both sometimes produced some glial uptake 12-16 days following the injection but this was readily differentiated from nearby primary neuronal uptake. Visualizing simultaneously the soma distributions of the neuron populations projecting to several different cortical fields in the one experimental animal has important advantages: (1) many fewer experimental animals are used especially important when using primates (2) neurons with axon projections to two of the injection sites can be identified by ""double labeling"" of the neuron soma and (3) the most important advantage relevant to this study-the increased precision with which the thalamic soma distributions of the neuron populations projecting to different cortical fields could be correlated in the sections of one brain. All cortical injection sites were reconstructed from serial sections and their extent volumes and relations to the surrounding cortex and to adjacent injection sites were systematically measured. 3 illustrates one such reconstruction and Table 2 summarizes the dimensions of cortical injection sites in this and the following paper (Darian-Smith et al. The age of the animal did not seem to influence the intracortical spread of injected dye. Injection sites involving several separate dye injections have been omitted from the tabulation.

Inset at upper left shows the respective positions of these injections in the rostra1 lip of the central sulcus (CS). Photograph is of section of whole injection site of DY. Volumes of mapped injection sites were: EB 11.7 mm3; FB 8.1 mm'; DY 1.1 mm'.

We observed with FB and DY that retrograde labeling of neurons was always associated with necrosis within the injection site: with four injections (2 x FB 2 x DY) not included in the present series in which no such necrosis was observed there was no retrograde labeling of neurons. With FG necrosis was usually seen within the zone of injection but was not essential for uptake. FG was the least satisfactory of the dyes we used because even with small injection volumes the spread in the cortex was substantial (Table 21 and often difficult to define with confidence (see Fig. Necrosis was not observed within cortical injection areas for EB and RLM. RLM injection sites were sharply demarcated from the surrounding tissue and with comparable injection volumes were usually smaller than those of other dyes. The estimated volumes of injection sites are stated in the legend of each figure. With six experiments the cortical injection zone for a particular dye was designed to be an extended strip (Figs. 17 and 19) requiring several injections of the one dye. Only three injections reported here spread beyond the cerebral cortex into the underlying white matter. In the only experiment in the present series in which more than a few double-labeled individual neurons were observed the injection sites of the dyes involved were closely apposed and visibly overlapped in histological sections of the cortex. Thalamocortical projections to sensorimotor cortex In most experiments four fluorescent dyes were injected into particular localized zones of the sensorimotor cortex. 1 summarizes these injection sites in the eight macaques used in the study. The three main combinations of dye injection were (1) a series of injections of the four dyes extending across a particular cortical field as in monkeys 5 and 6 (area 3b/l) and in monkey 8 (area 4) (2) a sequence of injections scanning the sensorimotor representation of the handlforearm (monkeys 3 and 41 and (3) a series of precentral dye injections either within the large premotor cortex (monkey 7) or near the midline and including medial motor cortex SMA and anterior premotor cortex (monkeys 1 and 2). 19 in which some cortical injection sites overlapped two fluorescent dyes were identified in fewer than 30 of 20400 labeled neurons mapped in the present experiments. This absence of double labeling was striking in view of the fact that (1) with ten pairs of injections the separation of the boundaries of the injection sites was between 1.0 and 1.5 mm and (2) double-labeled cells were often observed in newborn macaques when the separation of injection sites was 4 mm or even more (Darian-Smith et al. The important cortex surrounding the buried part of the central sulcus including area 3a however was not systematically analyzed because of the technical difficulty of obtaining a high hit-rate in correctly placing the dye injections. Projections to area 4 Seven dye injections were made within area 4 close to the central sulcus (see Fig. With all of these injections Betz cells could be identified in cresyl violet sections in the cortex rostra1 to the injection. Three of these injections were in 10969861 1990 1 Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.902990103 by Rwth Aachen Hochschulbibliothe Wiley Online Library on [12/09/2023]. The remaining injections in four different monkeys were either near the midline (monkeys 1 and 2) or lateral (monkeys 3 and 41 as in monkey 8. 4 illustrates 6 of the 18 coronal maps of neurons labeled with the three fluorescent dyes injected into area 4 in monkey 8. The colored solid forms define the thalamic soma territories for projections to the injection sites in the motor cortex illustrated in Fig. 10 upper tabulation) the dye injections in area 4 were located more laterally than in the other experiments and possibly extended into the head representation lateral to that of the hand. These dyes were injected into motor cortex 16 days previous to perfusion of the brain their locations viewed from above being shown in the upper left insert in A.; A plane of section of map A; CS central sulcus; IPS intraparietal sulcus. Serial sequence of 16 coronal maps 400 km apart of the soma distribution of neurons labeled with DY injected into motor cortex of macaque 8. In the present study we attempted to minimize these demarcation problems by placing the dye injections well away from the contentious boundary areas.

In monkeys 1 and 2 one of the dye injections was placed in the anterolateral part of area 6aa (Figs. The thalamocortical projection patterns to each of the cortical injection sites were quite different as can be seen from the coronal maps (Fig. 1 Relative weightings of thalamic nuclear projections to different precentr; :ortical areas based on the data from 19 fluorescent dye injections. Analysis used for each injection is set out in Fig. Thalammrtical projections to supplementary motor area Four fluorescent dye injections in macaques 1 and 2 were made in the most medial part of area 6aa approximating to the zones designated SMA in published maps of Woolsey ('64) and Brinkman and Porter ('79). Each small injection site (0.9-1.5 mm diameter) was located in the dorsal part of the cingulate gyrus. Examples of reconstructions of these injections sites are illustrated in Fig. Inset illustrates the cortical injection sites viewed from above. No double labeling was seen although the pairs of injections in each monkey were quite close (1.2 mm separation of margins of injections). Thalamocorticalprajections topostarcuatecortex Two entirely intracortical injections each of EB were made into the caudal lip of the arcuate sulcus in monkeys 3 and 4: their diameters were approximately 1.5 and 2.0 mm. Since a much larger experimental series of postarcuate injections was completed in the infant macaque further consideration of this controversial area of cortex is deferred to the following paper (Darian-Smith et al. 1) fluorescent dyes were injected into 11 sites in area 3b/l and 2 in area 215; the volumes of the intracortical uptake zones were 0.8-2.6 mm3. I a series of dye injections were made in the region of the hand representation to examine the projections to areas 3b 1 and 2 in more detail. 1 because of the unique pattern of cortical dye injections) we looked for changes in the thalamocortical projections visualized by fluorescent dye injections into (1) the caudal lip of the central sulcus (2) the crown of the postcentral gyrus and (3) the rostra1 lip of the intraparietal sulcus. 19 shows the pattern of dye injections viewed from above. By contrast double labeling resulting from comparably spaced dye injections was common with thalamocortical projections to sensorimotor cortex in the newborn macaque (Darian-Smith et al. The finger pad representation in squirrel monkeys at (1) the rostral boundary of areas 3b and 3a and (2) the caudal boundary of areas 1 and 2 were mapped electrophysiologically and injections of a radiolabel and HRP made at these sites. 17) of the present experiments in which we observed no thalamic neurons double-labeled with dyes injected into the adjacent cortical fields 3b 1 or 2 the injected labels had a similar disposition to those in the experiments of Cusick et al. The somatotopic mismatch of the injection sites suggested by Cusick et al. Although no electrophysiological identification of the hand representation in areas 3b and 1 was attempted in this experiment the two dye injections in areas 3bll and 215 each extended about 6 mm mediolaterally (inset Fig. 17a); it was therefore probable that at least parts of somatotopically matching cortex were injected with the two dyes. In these experiments area 3b was ablated several months before HRP was injected into areas 1 and 2.

In additional animals tritiated amino acids and horseradish perioxidase injections were made within different regions of the insula. Although the injection sites in these additional cases may have included minor extensions into claustrum and adjacent structures several tentative conclusions emerged with respect to the antero-posterior gradient in insulothalamic connectivity. 110 METHODS This report is based on material drawn from a collection of experiments performed on 18 male rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta).Tritiated amino acids (TAA; approximately 0.05 p1 of 25-37 pCi of radioactive proline lysine leucine and amino acid mixture) were injected in one hemisphere. This was followed 5 days later with injection of free horseradish peroxidase (HRP) (20% aqueous HRP Miles Laboratories Kankakee IL) or HRP conjugated to wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) (10% aqueous HRP-WGA) in the contralateral insula. Total volume injected in each case ranged between 0.05 and 0.09pl. At the termination of the survival period (7 days for TAA injections 48 hrs for HRP) all animals were deeply anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (35 mgkg intraperitoneally) and perfused transcardially with saline fixative and buffered sucrose according to procedure I1 of Rosene and Mesulam The brain was removed from the skull the hemispheres separated and photographed. The methods for exposing the insula and placing the appropriate injectate have been described in previous papers (Mufson and Mesulam '82). The distribution of autoradiographic grains and HRP-filled neurons as well as the extent of the injection sites were charted using an X-Y plotter coupled Lo the mechanical stage of a Nikon compound microscope. The center of the HRP injection site was defined as an area containing such intense precipitation of reaction product that neither cells nor axons were individually identifiable. Surrounding the center of the injection was a halo of less intense HRP reaction product. The difficulties inherent in the histochemical demonstration of an 'injection site' have been discussed elsewhere (Mesulam '82). In the autoradiographic material the injection site was defined as the region around the needle tract where TAA was uniformly intense over cell bodies as well as over the neuropil. Those other regions where labeling was substantially and consistently above the background were considered to receive efferent projections from the injection site. Of the seven animals with HRP and the eleven with TAA injections two representative HRP and three TAA cases will be described in detail. In this case the injection site was confined within the boundaries of the insular cortex. There was no spread of injectate to the underlying claustrum extreme capsule putamen or to the overlying opercular or supratemporal cortex. Case 2 (TAA) and case 3 (HRP): anterior insula The injection sites in cases 2 and 3 were in the anterior insula (Figs. In both cases the injections extended into the Ia-p and Idg sectors of the insula as well as to the underlying claustrum. In case 3 the HRP injection site may have extended into the lateral border of the putamen the insular limb of the prepiriform cortex and a narrow strip of the supratemporal plane. The spread of injectate to noninsular regions in these as well as in the other cases reported in this study may have partially contributed to the labeling seen in the thalamus. With respect to the insula the injection sites in cases 4 and 5 were almost entirely within the granular insula with a minor extension into the most caudal part of the dysgranular insula (Figs. In both cases the injection site probably extended into the underlying claustrum. In both cases the overlying opercular and supratemporal plane were damaged during the surgical approach however there was no spread of injectate to these regions. The data derived from these posterior insular injections suggested several differences when compared to the more anterior injections.

DISCUSSION In case 1 with TAA injection restricted to the dysgranular-granular insular cortex efferent projections to the thalamus were observed within the medial and inferior ventroposterior nuclei (VPM VPM and VPI) the medial dorsal complex (MD and MD) the pulvinar nucleus (PuL and PuL) the reuniens (Re) the CM the parafasicularis nucleus (Po and the reticular nucleus (R). The interpretation of the findings derived from the other cases is somewhat more difficult due to the inclusion of the claustrum and in some cases the putamen in the injection site. The present findings are in general agreement with this observation since the heaviest labeling in this nucleus was seen after posterior insula injections. Connections with MD especially MD mc and with some midline (Ci Cim) and intralaminar (CM and Pf) nuclei were more intense in cases with tracer injections in the more anterior insula.""",

Surgical and histological procedures Injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugated to wheat germ agglutinin (HRP-WGA Sigma) were placed in orbital and medial cortices in six animals (cases AG AF AM AH AE and AO) and fluorescent dye injections were placed in another five (cases AI AL AJ AK and AQ). Because we injected two dyes in most animals the fluorescent dye experiments yielded data for nine sites. Thus altogether 15 sites were injected with tracers. In addition an injection was placed in primary olfactory areas (olfactory tubercle and prepiriform areas; case AIy) which have either a nuclear appearance or an incipient laminar arrangement (Heimer et al. All injections were made with a microsyringe (Hamilton 5 ~1) mounted on a microdrive. Small amounts (0.05 ~1 8% HRP-WGA; 0.4 ~1 3% diamidino yellow or fast blue) of the injectate were delivered 1.5 mm below the pial surface at each of two adjacent sites separated by 1-2 inm over a 30 minute period. In the HRP experiments 40-48 hours after injection the monkeys were anesthetized deeply and perfused through the heart with saline followed by 2 liters of fixative (1.25% glutaraldehyde 1% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer at pH 7.41 followed by 2 liters of cold (4C) phosphate buffer (0.1 M pH 7.4). In animals injected with fluorescent dyes the survival period was 10 days. Thalamic drawings the location of labeled neurons ipsilateral and contralateral to the injection site and the site of blood vessels used as landmarks were transferred from the slides onto paper by means of a digital plotter (Hewlett Packard 7475A) electronically coupled to the stage of the microscope and to a computer (Compaq 386). Procedural variables such as size of the injection site exposure of the tissue to alcohol etc. To minimize the above extrinsic factors the relative afferent input to the injected site from a particular thalamic nucleus was assessed by expressing the number of labeled neurons in serial sections through that nucleus as a percentage of the total number of labeled neurons in the entire thalamus in that case. Reconstruction of injection sites The cortical regions containing the injection sites were reconstructed serially by using the sulci as landmarks as described previously (Barbas 1988) and are shown on diagrams of the surface of the cortex. In cases with injections of fluorescent dyes thalamic borders were placed in the same brain sections used for recording labeled neurons which were stained with cresyl violet after charting. RESULTS Injection sites Figure 1 is a composite of the injection sites on the medial (Fig. 1B) surfaces of the frontal cortex in all casesExamples of injection sites are shown in Figure 1C and D. Some of the cases used in this study were described previously in connection with their amygdaloid projections (Barbas and De Olmos 1990). A detailed description of the architectonic criteria used to determine the location of the injection sites has been provided in the above studies. In Figure 1 and in the Tables cases with injections of HRP are designated by two letters and those with fluorescent dyes by three. In the latter the third letter refers to the type of fluorescent dye injected (b for fast blue; y for diamidino yellow). Eight orbital sites were injected with retrograde tracers in six animals. Three cases involved single injections of HRP-WGA and three others included two fluorescent dyes each. In the latter one injection was made in a medial area and is included with the medial cases below. An injection of diamidino yellow in primary olfactory areas was placed in one case (My). In this case the injection was located in the frontal portion of the prepiriform cortex and the adjacent olfactory tubercle. All other injections were found to be in orbitofrontal cortices. Of these an injection of HRP covered orbital area PAll with invasion of the adjacent area Pro (case AG; Fig. In two cases the injections were located in orbital area Pro in its central extent (case ALy) and laterally in another (case AF; Fig. In two other cases the injection was restricted to area 13. An injection of diamidino yellow in case AJy covered the most caudal part of orbital area 12. The halo of this injection spread slightly to the adjacent area Pro. In the last orbital case (AM) the HRP injection was in area 11. Composite of the injection sites on the medial (A) and basal (B) surfaces of the cerebral hemisphere. The injection sites are superimposed on an architectonic map of the prefrontal cortex (Barhas and Pandya 1989). In case A0 the extension of the injection into dorsal area 9 is not shown. Cg cingulate sulcus; PAlI transitional agranular areas; Pro a transitional dysgranular orbital area; OLF the anterior olfactory nucleus and olfactory tubercle; Pir the prepiriform Because contralateral thalamic projections are an important component of the present study it was critical that the injections be strictly unilateral. While it was possible to restrict the halo of the injection site to the ipsilateral hemisphere in cases with orbital injections (Fig. lCD) this proved harder to achieve with medial injections in which the two hemispheres are juxtaposed. Five injection sites (cases AKy AIb AE AO and AQy) were confined to the ipsilateral side and their contralateral projections will be described below. In case AIb an injection of fast blue was found in areas 32 and 24 in front of the rostral tip of the corpus callosum. In two cases the injections were located in area 32. Cases with fluorescent dye injections are represented by three letters; the third letter in each refers to the type of dye injected (b for fast blue; y for diamidino yellow). Examples of the injection site (arrow) in case AG with an injection in area PAlliPro (C) and in case AF with an injection restricted to area Pro (D arrow). In two other cases the injections were located in area 9. In one of these (AQy) an injection of diamidino yellow was within the caudal part of medial area 9. In the other (case AO) an injection of HRP was at the junction of the medial and dorsal part of rostral area 9. In two other cases the halo of the injection spread slightly to the contralateral homonymous cortex which precluded consideration of contralateral thalamic projections in these (cases AH AKb). In case AH the HRP injection was restricted to area 25 but its halo extended slightly to the contralateral area 25. In case AKb the injection was in area 14 but the halo slightly invaded the contralateral area 14. The injections in this study were relatively small and in all but one case the needle mark was restricted to the cortical mantle with no apparent damage to the underlying white matter. At the level of injection in case My the olfactory tubercle is continuous with the ventral striatum and there is no white matter border between the two structures (for review see Alheid et al. In this animal the injection extended 1.8 mm deep from the pial surface.

The ratio of labeled neurons in MDmc to MDpc in cases with caudal orbital injections was higher than in rostral orbital or medial cases. In cases with injections in caudal orbital areas (cases AG AF ALy AJb AJy) labeled neurons were found medially in MDmc but occupied different parts of the nucleus along its dorsoventral dimension. In cases with injections in more rostral orbital cortices most labeled neurons occupied a more lateral and central sector within the mediolateral and dorsoventral axes of MDmc (case ALb; filled triangles in Fig. 7A; 5.6-28.1% Table 11 and were comparatively sparsely distributed in cases with rostral orbital injections (cases ALb filled triangles in Fig. On the other hand in cases with orbital injections comparatively smaller proportions of the labeled neurons were noted in midline nuclei (cases AM; AG; AF Figs.

E shows labeled neurons restricted to the ipsilateral MDmc after injection of HRP in area 11 (case AM). Double-labeled neurons In cases with injection of two fluorescent dyes in different prefrontal areas in the same animal it was possible to ask whether projections from one thalamic nucleus directed to two areas emanate from distinct populations of neurons or from the same neurons via axon collaterals. In addition one case with an injection of diamidino yellow in area 32 (case AKy) had an additional injection of fast blue in area 14 in connection with another study (Barbas et al. Most double-labeled neurons were noted in case A1 (n = 26) with an injection of diamidino yellow in olfactory areas and an injection of fast blue in area 32/24; most of these were noted in midline and intralaminar nuclei (filled squares in Fig. Double-labeled neurons were seen also in case AL with an injection of diamidino yellow in orbital area Pro and fast blue in area 13 (n = 17) and most of these were found in MDmc (filled squares in Fig. In case AJ with injections in areas 13 and 12 and in case AK with injections in areas 32 and 14 there were very few doublelabeled neurons (4 and 6 respectively). 21n another case with an injection in area 9 (case AQy not shown) there were no labeled neurons in the contralateral thalamus. Bilateral corticothalamic projections Although the study focused on the pattern of bilateral thalamic projections to prefrontal areas we made a few observations on the anterograde labeling from the cortex to the thalamus in cases with injections of HRP-WGA. Our observations were based on three orbital cases with injections in areas PAll and Pro and area 11 (cases AG AF and AM) and on two medial cases with injections in area 32 (case AE) and area 9 (case AO).

Two adjoining injections of wheat germ agglutinin-conjugated horseradish peroxidase (WGAHRP Sigma Type VI 7.5% aqueous solution) each consisting of 0.05 pl were placed at 3-5 mm depth in either bank of the STS under direct visualization. Following a 48-hour postinjection survival period the animals received a lethal dose of sodium pentobarbital and were perfused transcardially according to the protocol of Rosene and Mesulam ('78). Each section was analyzed in terms of injection site and labeled neurons by use of brightfield microscopy. The injection site in each case was reconstructed from serial sections on tracings of the cortical surface of the STS.

Each animal then received 2 or 3 injections (0.4 to 1 ~1 total volume) of a mixture of radiolabeled amino-acids (3HProline and H-Leucine specific activity 20 Ci/mmol). In each animal small injections of tracer were placed in different areas of the orbital medial and lateral surfaces of the prefrontal cortex under visual guidance using Walkers cytoarchitectionic map and the sulci and gyri as landmarks. Following a postinjection survival time of 7-9 days each animal was anesthetized with a lethal dose of sodium pentobarbital (Nembutal) and perfused through the heart with 300 cc of normal saline containing 1% NaNo followed by 2 liters of 10% formalin. In each case the architectonic areas exposed to tracers were identified by comparing the cytoarchitectonic features of the cortex surrounding each injection site in thionin-stained sections with previously published cytoarchitectonic maps of the prefrontal cortex (Walker '40a; Barbas and Pandya '89). The architectonic features in the sections surrounding and including the injection site were compared with previously published architectonic maps of the prefrontal cortex enabling us to determine the areas involved by each injection. In this study we were unable to demonstrate label transported to this nucleus from injections in the prefrontal cortex. Ventral prefrontal cortical injections Orbital cortex. Four animals received isotope injections in different portions of the orbitofrontal cortex. 3A) the injection mainly involved Pro and area 13 with some encroachment on adjoining area 12. 3B) the injection was principally in area 14 but also extended into adjacent areas 11 and 13. 30 isotope was injected into area 12 in the caudal orbitofrontal cortex whereas in case 4 (not illustrated) the injection was limited primarily to area 13. There were minor variations in the distribution of label in the cases with injections in the rostral versus caudal orbital cortex. In cases 1 and 3 with injections of caudal orbitofrontal cortex label extended more ventrally within MDmc (Fig. 3B) which had a more rostral injection had label distributed more centrally and laterally within MDmc. Three animals received isotope injections in the lateral prefrontal cortex lying ventral to the principal sulcus. Unlike the four cases with orbitofrontal injections described above in each of these cases labeling was seen mainly in MDpc. The injection in case 5 (Fig. The injections in cases 6 and 7 were located mainly in ventral area 46 with minor involvements of dorsal area 46 in case 6 (not shown) and adjoining lateral area 12 in case 7 (Fig. One animal (case 8) received an injection of tracer in ventral area 8 within the concavity of the arcuate sulcus (Fig. Dorsal prefrontal cortical injections Medial cortex. Two animals (cases 9 and 10) received injections of tracer below the rostral end of the cingulate sulcus. In case 9 (not illustrated) the injection involved areas 32 and 10 whereas in case 10 (Fig. 5A) the injection was confined primarily to area 32 with some involvement of adjacent area 24. 5B) the injection was placed ventromedially in the prefrontal cortex and involved areas 25 and 14. In three animals injections of tracer were placed in the dorsolateral PFC above the principal sulcus. 5C) the injection involved the dorsal bank of the principal sulcus (areas 9 and 46). Case 13 (not illustrated) received an injection in the region dorsal to the principal sulcus (area 9). 6A) isotope was injected into the caudal portion of area 46 and extended into the dorsal portion of area 8. In case 13 in which the injection involved areas 46 and 9 the label in MDpc was more dorsally displaced than in case 12. The involvement of MDmf in this case could be attributed to the injection having involved area 8 (see below). In two animals tracer injections involved dorsal area 8 within the concavity of the arcuate sulcus. The injection in case 15 (Fig. The injection in case 16 (Fig. The labeling in MDpc in case 15 can be attributed to the injection having involved area 46 (Fig. 6A) in which the injection also Dorsal lateral cortex.

MATERIALS AND METHODS Preparation of the animals recording and HRP injections The material derives from two adult (weight: 5-6 kg) female monkeys (Macaca nemestrina). On the occasions when the fibre was impaled as indicated by a sharp drop in the DC potential of about 40 mV the receptive field was remapped and the fibre was then injected with HRP by using depolarizing current pulses (2-4 nA) for several minutes or as long as it was possible to retain intraaxonal recording. Perfusion peroxidase histochemistry and embedding Two to 12 hours after the injection of HRP the monkey was given an overdose of barbiturate and perfused through the heart with saline followed by 2.5% glutaraldehyde and 190 paraformaldehyde. Two- and three-dimensional reconstruction of HRP-filled axons The HRP-injected axons were drawn first by using a drawing tube and then digitized by using two different three-dimensional neuron reconstruction systems. In general the injected axons were more extensive and contained more boutons than those reported by Blasdel and Lund ('83). There may be several reasons for this including intrinsic variability in the axonal morphology methodological differences and differences in the region of area 17 in which the injected axons arborized.""",

Cortical connections ofmacaque SPL In this section we will describe the cortical inputs to SPL based on injections of retrograde neuronal tracers in separate areas of this structure taking into account the recent areal subdivision of SPL (Fig.2A) (Gamberini etal. According to the retinotopic organization of V6 (Fig.3) injections of retrograde neuronal tracer in its central or peripheral representation produced a strong labeling in central or peripheral representation respectively of area V1. A Laminar pattern of labeling in V1 after V6 tracer injection. Frontal lobe with cells (colored dots) labeled after retrograde tracer injection in areas PEc (green; three injections) V6Av (orange; two injections) and V6Ad (pink; three injections). According to this view labeled cells in V6A MIP and LIP after V6 injection were confned in the ventral part of these areas where previous functional experiments have demonstrated that cells were more likely activated by visual stimulations (Blatt etal. We found that the distribution of labeling within areas VIP and LIPv did not depend on central or peripheral injections in V6 suggesting that both parietal areas are not retinotopically organized (Galletti etal. 1993) but anatomical experiments revealed segregated aferents to LIP and VIP after injections in diferent parts of retinotopically organized areas (Colby etal. Peripheral V6 injections produced labeling in the ventral portion of MIP while central injections produced labeling in a dorsal portion of it (Galletti etal.

This stain allowed for the analysis of cortical architecture localization of the injection clei. The precise locations of the injections were determined by observing the cortical architecture around the labeled area in the cortex and comparing this with the architecture of the corresponding nonlabeled area of the opposite hemisphere. Figure 4 (B-F) shows representative injection sites in five different cases described below. The modified architectonic parcellation of Pandya and Seltzer ('82a) of the posterior parietal lobe is also used in this paper to describe the cortical areas involved in the various isotope injections (Fig. Although the purpose of this study is to investigate the corticothalamic connections of the posterior parietal cortex certain rostral isotope injections involve a bordering portion of area 2. Superior and medial parietal cortex In nine cases separate injections of tritated amino acids were placed in various subregions caudal to the superior postcentral dimple. In two cases isotope injections involved the rostral portion of the superior parietal lobule. As shown in Figure 5 in case 1 the injection involved area PE on the convexity of SPL whereas in case 2 the injection included areas PE and PEa in the upper bank of the intraparietal sulcus (IPS). For example in case 2 with the injection extending into area PEa in the intraparietal sulcus the label was more marked in the PM and PO nuclei. In another four cases injections occupied the caudal portion of the superior parietal lobule area PEc and extended into the adjacent cortex of the intraparietal sulcus. As shown in Figure 6 for case 3 with an injection in caudal area PE (Fig. In three other cases isotope injections involved the medial surface of the parietal lobe. The injection in case 7 occupied the caudal portion of the cingulate sulcus area PEci whereas in case 8 (Fig. 4C) and case 9 the injections were confined to the parietal cortex below the cingulate sulcus area PGm. The label in case 7 with isotope injection in the caudal tip of the cingulate sulcus (area PEci) was found mainly in the VL nucleus. Inferior parietal cortex In ten animals isotope injections were placed in different subregions of the inferior parietal lobule (IPL). injections involved the rostral portion of the inferior parietal lobule area PF and adjacent parts of the intraparietal sulcus. 4D) the injection extended rostrally and dorsally to encompass the area at the tip of the IPS. In all three cases the injection also involved the adjacent portion of area 2 of the postcentral gyrus. In another three cases (13-13 isotope injections involved middle portions of the inferior parietal lobule. In case 13 the injection involved the dorsal portion of area PFG and the adjacent intraparietal sulcal cortex. Thus in case 13 with an injection extending into the intraparietal sulcus grains tended to occupy more of the PM nucleus than in cases 14 and 15. In another four cases (16-191 isotope injections were placed in various regions of the caudal inferior parietal lobule areas PG and Opt. In three cases (16 18 and 19) the injections were confined to the lateral surface of IPL; Figure 4F shows the injection site in case 18. In case 17 the injection involved the dorsal portion of caudal IPL and extended into the adjacent cortex of the lower bank of the intraparietal sulcus. Corticothalamic fiber pathways The use of autoradiographic techniques has allowed us to trace the corticothalamic fiber trajectory leading from each of the injection sites. In each case the central white matter core underlying the injection site contained two dense fiber bundles heading medially. B-F. Photomicrographs of five representative isotope injection sites from cases involving various areas of the posterior parietal cortex (B case 3; C case 8; D case 11; E case 13 F case 18). It should be pointed out however that the projections to VPM and VPI from the rostral IPL cases could result from the involvement of area 2 in all three injections. According to the recent observations of Weber and Yin ('84) an injection limited strictly to area PF did not result in terminal label in the ventrobasal complex.

Jones 1983) in this study only 2 fields were examined in any given animal and injection sites were not topographically matched. We sought to address these issues by injecting a different anatomical tracer in 2 to 4 different cortical fields in the same monkey. Because the somatotopic location for each injection site was electrophysiologically determined it was possible to inject tracers into the representation of the same body part in each cortical field. The size of receptive fields varies for neurons in different cortical areas so that in some cases the same size injection involved the representation of more body parts in some areas than in others. Despite this injections could be placed in locations across areas where neurons had overlapping receptive fields.

Labeled cells resulting from these injections were identified in the dorsal thalamus and related to architectonic boundaries and in one case to electrophysiologically identified boundaries. Injections of Anatomical Tracers A total of 24 injections were made in different cortical areas in 8 animals (Table 2). A digital image was made of the exposed neocortex so that electrophysiological recording sites and injections could be directly related to the vasculature of the brain. Neuroanatomical tracers were injected into electrophysiologically defined portions of the hand and digit representations (see below). In 2 cases DY was diluted with 0.1 M phosphate buffer to make a 2% solution and 0.45--0.5lL were injected into area 2 (cases 7 and 8). Finally in 2 cases 0.6 lL of Cholera Toxin Subunit-B (CTB; 1% in distilled water) was injected into area 5 (cases 7 and 8). After the injections were complete the brain was covered with a sterile contact lens the dura flaps were folded over the contact lens and the skull was replaced and held in place with acrylic or a new skull was made from acrylic. The injection site core and halo surrounding the injection site were included in our reconstructions of injection sites and these boundaries were directly related to architectonic borders (see Krubitzer et al. 1998 for details on determining injection site spread).

For animals in which electrophysiological recordings were made to guide injection placement the cortex was continually bathed in sterile saline.

Histological Processing After the appropriate time had transpired for transport of tracer or upon completion of the acute electrophysiological mapping portion of the experiment each animal was euthanized with a lethal injection of sodium pentobarbital (60 mg/kg). For the cortex the injection site was plotted and included the central core as well as the surrounding halo. In our figures the outer boundary of the injection site represents the outer boundary of the halo. Once architectonic boundaries were drawn cells in the thalamus resulting from each injection site were counted. For density determination cells in a given nucleus resulting from an injection of one neuranatomical tracer was expressed as a percentage of the total number of labeled cells in the thalamus resulting from that injection. The data shown in Figure 7 represent the mean percentage of neurons for injections in a particular area in the different cases. This allowed us to relate injection sites to electrophysiologically defined boundaries. These probes were identified in histologically processed tissue (see above) adjacent to the reconstructed fluorescent section that contained the injection site and architectonic boundaries were drawn; this was done for the entire series of sections through the cortex (description of cortical Figure 2. By aligning probes sulcal landmarks injection site holes and other tissue artifacts injection sites could be related to both electrophysiological and architectonic boundaries. First for all but one case injections were placed into electrophysiologically identified representations of body parts of each cortical field and related to architectonically defined boundaries (Fig. Second in cases in which connections of different cortical fields were examined the same or overlapping body part representations were injected. All but one of these injections was restricted to the field of interest. Although microelectrode recordings have been used to identify injection sites in somatosensory cortex (e.g. 1986) our combination of electrophysiological identification of somatotopically matched injection sites in multiple cortical areas in the same animal together with the electrophysiological identification of thalamic nuclei projecting to these areas has not been reported for any species of primate. These architectonic boundaries were matched to electrophysiological recordings in the cortex in all cases to determine the borders of cortical areas and the location of injections sites within each area. 1 an injection of FB was centered in the representation of the glabrous middle phalanx of D3 (mD3); an injection of DY was centered in the representation of the proximal thenar pad and an injection of FR was centered in the representation of dorsal digits 3--5. Ninety-five percent of all labeled cells in the thalamus were only labeled from a single injection in a particular cortical field and 5% were double labeled; only 1 cell was triple labeled. Because the injection site was small and the D3 representation is several millimeters medial to the representation of the chin in area 3b the few labeled cells observed in the chin representation of VPm are unlikely to be the result of spread of the injection into the chin representation of area 3b. The injection in the representation of the proximal thenar pad in area 3b was extremely small (~400 3 100 lm) and resulted in only a few labeled cells in the hand representation (including the glabrous pads) of VPl and in the forelimb representation of VPs (Fig. Finally a small injection into the representations of the dorsal hairy skin of D3-D5 in area 3b resulted in labeled cells in the representation of the digits and the upper trunk and shoulder representations of VPl (Fig. Double-labeled cells were observed in VPl from injections placed in the dorsal digits and thenar pad representations and from the mD3 and thenar pad representations. Double-labeled cells were also observed in VPs from injections in the glabrous middle D3 representation and the dorsal digits representation (Fig. Finally one triple-labeled cell was observed in VPl from injections in each of the 3 representations. 9) all injections were in cortical locations where neurons were responsive to touch or pressure on the distal glabrous phalanx of digit 4 or the phalanges of digits 4 and 3. Overall the injections labeled somatotopically appropriate portions of the thalamic nuclei. When neurons in the same nucleus were labeled by more than one injection the clusters of labeled neurons projecting to different cortical areas overlapped as expected from injections carefully placed in somatotopically matched regions of different areas. The injection in area 3a resulted in labeled cells mostly in VPl and VLp (Figs 7 and 9). A few of these labeled neurons were in VPs as expected for area 3a injections but more were in VP. The injection in area 3b in case no. The injection in area 1 labeled neurons mainly in VPl but a moderate number of Cerebral Cortex September 2009 V 19 N 9 2047 labeled neurons were also in VPi VPs and Pla. Finally the injection in area 2 labeled neurons mainly in VPs with moderate labeling in VPl and VPi in the location of the hand representation in each of these nuclei. Again injections were placed in somatotopically matched locations in areas 3a 3b 1 and 2. Each injection included cortex representing the distal phalanx of digit 3 whereas injections in areas 3a and 2 included neurons with larger receptive fields that extended to digits 2 and 4 (Fig. The average percentage of labeled neurons found in each thalamic nucleus following injections in areas 3a 3b 1 2 and 5 (A--F). Percentages of neurons were determined for each area injected and then the mean percentage for that area from all cases was used to calculate the percentages shown in these histograms. The percentage of double-labeled cells is shown in G. Most double-labeled cellsregardless of the 2 fields injected were found in VP. injection so that both areas 3b and 1 contained portions of the injection site. As in the previous case dorsoventral bands of neurons from all 4 injections occupied the hand subnucleus of VPl and adjoining parts of VPs. The area 3a injection labeled neurons in both VPl and VPs and at rostral levels labeled neurons were in VLp (not shown). The area 3b plus area 1 injection labeled neurons throughout the hand subnucleus of VPl a few neurons in adjoining nuclei VPs and VPi and neurons in Pla. The area 1 injection labeled neurons Figure 8. The location of electrophysiologically identified injections sites in area 3b in cortex that was sectioned tangentially (top box) and coronal sections of the thalamus (A-- C) in case #1. In the top box the receptive fields for neurons at the center of each injection site are drawn on illustrations of the hand and color coded to match the tracer injected. All injection sites are restricted to portions of the hand representation. The injection of FB was centered in the representation of glabrous middle D3 the injection of DY was centered in the representation of the proximal glabrous thenar pad and the injection of FR was centered in the representation of the dorsal digits 3--5. Labeled cells resulting from these injections are depicted below and their direct relationship to electrophysiologically defined locations in the thalamus is depicted in sections A--C. These sections correspond to similarly labeled sections in Figure 4. The larger injection in area 2 labeled many neurons in VPs and VPl and a few in rostral Pla and in VLp (not shown). The majority of double-labeled neurons (38%) were the result of the injection in area 2 and either 3a 3b or 1. This is not surprising because the injection in area 2 was relatively large Figure 9. The locations of electrophysiologically identified injection sites in areas 3a 3b 1 and 2 in cortex that was sectioned tangentially (top left box) and coronal sections of the thalamus (A--F) in case no. In the top left box the receptive fields for neurons at the center of each injection site are drawn on illustrations of the hand and color coded to match the area injected. Labeled cells resulting from injections in areas 1 and 2 were observed primarily in VPl with moderate label in VPs. The injection in area 3a resulted in dense label in VLp and VPl. The injection in area 2 resulted in dense label in VPs and moderate label in VPl and VPi. In some instances double-labeled cells were observed in VPl and VPs from injections in areas 3b and 1 (grey boxes to the right). One double-labeled cell was observed in VPl from injections in areas 3b and 2. Thus the injection in area 2 was more likely to be topographically matched with the injections in the other fields. Only 3 of the double-labeled neurons in VP were from the area 3b and 1 injections suggesting that although the injection in 3b spread slightly into area 1 it did not contaminate the injection site in area 1. The locations of electrophysiologically identified injection sites in areas 3a 3b 1 and 2 in cortex that was sectioned tangentially (top left box) and coronal sections of the thalamus (A--C) in case no. In the top left box the receptive fields for neurons at the center of each injection site are drawn on illustrations of the hand and color coded to match the area injected. The injection in area 2 resulted in dense label in VPs and moderate label in VPl. The injection in area 3a resulted in label in VPl VPs and VLp (on rostral sections not shown). Cerebral Cortex September 2009 V 19 N 9 2051 VPl were also labeled by the area 3b and the area 2 injections (Fig. Other neurons in VPl were labeled by both the area 1 and the area 2 injections or by the area 3a and the area 1 injections (Fig. Cells labeled by both the area 3a and the 3b injection or the area 1 and the area 2 injections were found in VPs and VLp. A few double-labeled cells from both the area 3a and the area 1 or the area 1 and the area 2 injections were in Pla. Further projections from VPl to these fields are from overlapping groups of neurons corresponding to the overlapping somatotopic locations of the injection site. However the spread of label in VP from injections from all 4 fields indicates that mismatched but functionally related body part representations projected to a single location in each field. Comparisons of Thalamocortical Connections of Areas 2 and 5 In the present study we also placed injections in separate but functionally related representations in area 2 to determine if thalamic projections to area 2 are divergent. In another set of experiments we placed injections in somatotopically congruent locations in both areas 2 and 5 to directly compare thalamic projections to these 2 areas in the same animals. Eight injections were placed in portions of the hand representation in area 2 in 7 cases (Table 2; case no. 9 not shown) and 4 injections were placed in portions of the hand representation in area 5 in 4 cases. In one of the cases illustrated 2 injections were placed in area 2 one in the D1 representation and the second in the D2 representation (case no. Photomicrographs of coronally sectioned portions of the dorsal thalamus that contain double-labeled cells (B C E and F) resulting from injections into electrophysiologically defined locations in areas 3a 3b 1 and 2 in case no. The illustration at the top depicts the receptive field locations for neurons at the center of each injection site. In this figure only the color of the receptive field corresponds to the color of the fluorescing labeled cell bodies rather than to the area injected. Double-labeled cells (white arrows in B and C) were observed in VPl following injections of fluorescent GB in area 3b and FG in area 2. Double-labeled cells were also observed in VPl following injections of FB in area 3a and FR in area 1. 5 in which different representations in area 2 were injected label in VPs and Pla overlapped in some regions but was in separate locations in other regions (Figs 12 and 13). 6 an injection was placed in a part of area 2 responsive to touch on the distal phalanx of digit 1 and a second injection was placed in a part of area 5 where touch over all of the glabrous digit 1 activated neurons (Fig. The injections labeled overlapping groups of neurons in VPs and Pla (Fig. There were many neurons in LP that were labeled from the area 5 injections and fewer neurons in LP were labeled from the area 2 injection. 7 where injections were placed in adjoining portions of the hand representation of areas 2 and 5 (Fig. In this case the clusters of labeled cells in the thalamus overlapped only slightly and the number of labeled cells for the small area 2 injection was much less than for the area 5 (Fig. Nevertheless both injections labeled neurons Figure 12. Digital images of injections of FR (red) into the representation of glabrous digit 2 and FE (green) into the representation of glabrous digit 1 in area 2 (top left panel). The locations of injection sites for this case (no. 5) were placed in electrophysiologically defined locations in area 2 that are shown on a digital image of the exposed cortex in the middle top panel and receptive fields for the neurons at these injection sites are shown in the top right panel. Labeled cell bodies resulting from those injections are depicted in horizontal sections of the thalamus (A--F). 8 in which nonadjacent representations of the hand were injected (distal d1 for the area 2 injection and the hypothenar pad + forearm taps for the area 5 injection) labeled cells from both injections partially overlapped in VPs and Pla. As in the previous case injections in area 5 also resulted in dense labeling in LP and the LP/VLp border and moderate to sparse labeling in VPl CL and MD (Fig. 9 not shown) in which injections in area 2 and area 5 were made without electrophysiological guidance resulted in patterns of label that were remarkably similar to those described for case no. When all cases of area 2 and 5 injections are considered together the data indicate that VPs is consistently and densely labeled following injections in area 2 and that Pla and VPl are moderately labeled in most cases. Digital images of horizontal sections stained with Cresyl violet (A) and reacted for CO (B) in case #5 and labeled cells in Pla (C) resulting from injections in D1 (FE green) and D2 (FR red). Digital images of an injection of FE (green) placed in the representation of glabrous distal digit 1 of area 2 and an injection of FR (red) placed in the D1 representation of area 5 (top left panel). 6) are illustrated in the top middle panel and receptive field locations for neurons at each injection site are drawn in the top right panel. Labeled cell bodies resulting from those injections are drawn in coronal sections through the thalamus in (A--E). The injection in area 5 was very small and resulted in labeled cells in VPs Pla and LP. The location of injection sites placed into electrophysiologically defined locations in areas 2 and 5 in case no. 7 (box at top left) and labeled cell bodies resulting from the injections in a coronal series through the thalamus (A--E). An injection of DY was centered in the proximal palm representation of area 2 and an injection of CTB was centered in radial hand wrist and dorsal d1 of area 5. Labeled cells resulting from injections in area 2 were observed almost exclusively in VPs. The location of injection sites placed into electrophysiologically defined locations in areas 2 and 5 in case #8 (box at top left) and labeled cell bodies resulting from these injections in a coronal series through the thalamus (A--F). An injection of DY was centered in the representation of the tip of area 2 and an injection of CTB was centered in representation of the proximal hypothenar pad of area 5. Labeled cells resulting from injections in area 2 were observed in VPs and Pla with moderate label in VPl. One previous study examined the thalamocortical connections of 2 closely placed injections in area 3b (Rausell and Jones 1995) and found double-labeled cells in VP only when injections were less than 600 lm apart. In the present investigation we observed double-labeled cells in VPl and VPs when injections were up to 2 mm apart. However as in the previous study most cells labeled from nearby injection sites in 3b in the present study resulted in labeled neurons in overlapping portions of VP (i.e. Only a few previous studies injected neuroanatomical tracers into electrophysiologically defined locations in VPl and recorded from locations in area 3b (e.g. In the latter study 2 separate body part representations in VPl were injected with neuroanatomical tracers to examine the amount of convergence in thalamocortical projections to area 3b (although the locations in area 3b were not electrophysiologically defined). (1998) observed a high degree of convergence in area 3b resulting from injections placed in separate locations in VPl. Likewise single relatively focal injections in VPm resulted in broadly distributed connections in area 3b indicating a high degree of divergence. In the one case in which the injection site in VPm and the cortical projection zone in area 3b were electrophysiologically determined an injection in the cheek pouch representation in VPm labeled terminals in the cheek pouch representation in area 3b as well as in cortex lateral to this location in the expected representations of the face and oral structures (e.g. There are only 2 studies that have injected anatomical tracers into electrophysiologically defined locations in area 2 and examined the total pattern of thalamocortical connections in primates these include the study by Pons and Kaas (1985b) in macaque monkeys and a recent study in the New World cebus monkey (Franca et al. Projections of Single Neurons to more than One Cortical Field In the present study we found small numbers of neurons that were labeled by separate injections in different somatosensory areas (Fig. It is difficult to relate the results of some of these previous studies with our own findings because in previous studies injection sites were not matched for somatotopic location and/or injection sites may have spread into each other and contaminated the results. (1985) is most compelling because separate injections in the digit tip representations along the 3b/3a border and along the 3b/1 border in squirrel monkeys where these areas are on the brain surface clearly 2060 Thalamic Connections of Somatosensory Cortex in Primates d Padberg et al. Although fewer double-labeled cells were found in the present study this could reflect species differences as well as differences in the size of injections and the amount of somatotopic overlap of maps in these fields. There were several previous studies in macaque monkeys where tracers were injected relative to sulcal patterns (e.g. Specializations of Somatosensory Processing One issue that should be kept in mind is that the injections in the present study (and most previous studies) were all made in the hand representation in the different cortical regions. Second it is least difficult to make injections in similar body part representations between cortical areas and different body part representations within a cortical area if one targets the hand representation. This allows for the first time a comprehensive study in individual animals while limiting the spread of the injections across body part and/or cortical boundaries. For example in marmosets injections in the forelimb representation in area 3a resulted in more broadly distributed connections with posterior parietal cortex than injections in the hindlimb representation (Huffman and Krubitzer 2001) and in area 5 in titi monkeys the digit tip representation has a greater density of connections with motor cortex premotor cortex and with areas 7b/AIP than does the hairy hand representation (Padberg et al.""",

Anterograde tracer injections into the dorsal midline thalamus resulted in heavy terminal labeling in the medial prefrontal network most notably in areas ventral to the genu of the corpus callosum (25 32 and 14c) but also in adjacent areas (13a and 13b). Retrograde tracer injection into the dorsal midline labeled similar areas. To achieve this small tracer injections were made into several areas of the OMPFC and systematically evaluated in MITN. In addition small injections were made into the dorsal midline thalamus to evaluate connections with the OMPFC. Additional data were also obtained by analyzing brain sections from previous experiments in which tracers were injected into the OMPFC (Carmichael and Price 1995ab 1996; An et al. Injections Prior to surgery stereotaxic coordinates for each injection site were specified for each animal from a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Distance from a line through the ear bars was calculated for each injection site by using the MRI images with reference to the atlas of Szabo and Cowan (1984). Animals were placed in a stereotaxic frame the skull was exposed and burr holes were made at the injection site coordinates. A tungsten electrode was lowered into the expected injection track to record spontaneous multiunit activity along the depth. For recording and injecting into the midline thalamus the sagittal sinus was retracted a few millimeters to one side to expose the midline. Retrograde tracers injected into each animal included fast blue (FB; Sigma St. Louis MO) diamidino yellow (DY; Sigma) cholera toxin B subunit (CtB; List Biological San Jose CA) or cholera toxin B subunit conjugated to colloidal gold conjugate (CtB-gold; List Biological). Tracers were injected through a micropipette by using an air pressure system that applied 25-msec air pulses to the pipette. The injection volumes were calculated as the cross-sectional area of the pipette times the distance traveled by the meniscus which was marked on the pipette. Movement of the meniscus during the injections was monitored with a dissecting microscope. Tracers were injected at a volume of 0.11.3 l depending on tracer sensitivity and the size of the target area. To avoid the spread of tracer along pipette track the pipette was left in place for 30 minutes after each injection. Six different tracers were injected into each animal. The relative strength of connections between individual MITN and the OMPFC was evaluated by measuring the density of labeled neurons and labeled varicosities in these nuclei following tracer injections into areas of the OMPFC (Table 1). Absolute values cannot be compared across experiments because of factors such as differences in transport levels between tracers in injection volumes and in the precise size and location of each injection. Midline nuclei were analyzed bilaterally whereas in the intralaminar nuclei only the hemisphere ipsilateral to the injection was analyzed. Unfolded maps of the prefrontal cortex were prepared to visualize the distribution and density of labeled varicosities and neurons following tracer injections into the dorsal midline (Fig. Because each map was prepared from a single experiment the relative density of labeling can be readily compared between cortical areas within each experiment although as discussed above exact comparisons between experiments are limited by differences in the size and efficacy of the injection and other factors. For the anterograde tracer injection (Fig. For the retrograde tracer injection (Fig. Photomicrographs of two retrograde tracer injections into medial network areas and the resulting label in the dorsal midline thalamus. In case OM61 an injection of cholera toxin B subunit (CtB) into areas 25/14c (A) resulted in labeled neurons in the Pa and Pt (B). In case OM73 an injection of CtB-gold (C) resulted in labeled neurons in the Pt with the Pa relatively void of labeling (D). Projections from MITN to OMPFC Retrograde tracers were injected into several areas of the OMPFC (Table 1A). Thus retrograde tracer injections into medial network areas resulted in a high density of labeled neurons in MITN. Conversely few labeled neurons were found following injections into orbital network areas. Retrograde tracer injections into medial network areas. Six injections were made into medial network areas 10o 11m 14c 24b and Iai; an additional three injections involved multiple areas within the medial network including areas 32/10m/14r 25/14c and 25/10m. Of these experiments those with injections in the caudal part of the medial network had retrogradely labeled neurons in the Pa and/or Pt and other MITN although the pattern of labeling varied slightly from one case to another. Thus an injection of CtB into areas 25/14c resulted in labeled neurons in both the Pa and Pt (Figs. 5BC) whereas an injection of CtB-gold into area 14c alone resulted in labeled neurons concentrated in the Pt (Figs. 5KO) there was a large injection of FB in deep layers of area 32 as well as in all layers of areas 10m and 14r. This injection resulted in labeled neurons in both the Pa and Pt. An injection of FR into 10m alone (Fig. In addition an injection of FB into area Iai of the medial network (in the lateral orbital cortex) resulted in a high density of labeled neurons in the Cim but little in other nuclei (Table 1A OM15). Tracer injections into other areas of the medial network resulted in little labeling in MITN. This was particularly true with injections closer to the frontal pole (areas 10o and 11m; Table 1A). An injection of FR into area 24b (dorsal to the corpus callosum) also resulted in lower densities of labeled neurons in MITN except for a moderate density in Cl (Fig. Retrograde tracer injections into medial/orbital network areas. Three injections were made into areas 13b 13a and 12o which have connections to both medial and orbital networks. An injection of DY into 13a (Fig. In another brain FB injected into 12o (Table 1A OM14) resulted in dense labeling in the Cim with little labeling in other MITN. An injection of FB into 13b however resulted in very little labeling in MITN (Table 1A). Retrograde tracer injections into orbital network areas. Eight injections were made into areas 12r 11l 12m 12l 13m Iam Iapm and Ial of the orbital network. 7FT; Table 1A) although following injections into 12l 13m Iam Fig. Distribution of labeled neurons in the thalamus (BE) following retrograde tracer injection into medial network cingulate area 24b (A).

Case numbers and injection sites are shown in the left column (AFKP) with the associated pattern of labeled neurons in the thalamus at four rostral-caudal levels to the right. In OM74 (P) the center and spread of the Fluoro Ruby (FR) injection site are shown. Projections from OMPFC to MITN Anterograde tracers (BDA FR and 3 H-leucine) were injected into several areas of the medial and orbital prefrontal networks as well as in intermediate medial/ orbital network areas. Consistent with the retrograde labeling dorsal midline thalamic nuclei contained some of the densest concentrations of labeled varicosities following injections into medial network areas. By comparison injections into orbital network areas labeled few projections to MITN. Anterograde tracer injections into medial network areas. Eight injections were made into medial network areas 10o 11m 10m (rostral) 10m (caudal) 32 25 24b and Iai. The injection into area 32 (Fig. An injection into the caudal part of 10m (Fig. An injection of BDA into area Iai (Table 1B OM37) resulted in dense labeling in the Cim. This result is consistent with the dense labeling in the Cim following retrograde injection into Iai (Table 1A OM15). Anterograde tracer injections into medial/orbital network areas. Two injections were made into the intermediate areas 13a and 12o. Injection of 3 H-leucine into area 13a (Fig 8CD; Table 1B OM19) resulted in a high density of silver grains specifically over the Pt with virtually no labeling above background in the Pa. An injection of BDA into 12o (Fig. Anterograde tracer injections into orbital network areas. Five injections were made into orbital network areas 12r 11l 12m 13l and Iapm. Moderate to low densities of labeled axons were found in the Cim and Cif following injections into 11l 12m 13l and Iapm but these usually extended from larger concentrations of labeled axons in adjoining parts of the MD (Fig. Projections from dorsal midline to OMPFC The anterograde tracer BDA was injected into the dorsal midline thalamus in OM67. Most of the injection was centered on the Pa and Pt although it also involved the rostral part of the Cdc and a small dorsal portion of the AM (Figs. The dense labeling observed in area 24a/b is most likely the result of involvement of the AM and not the Pa or Pt because an injection of the retrograde tracer FR into area 24b does not label neurons in the Pa or Pt (Fig. Projections from OMPFC to dorsal midline The retrograde tracer CtB was injected into the dorsal midline thalamus in OM64. This injection was restricted to the Pa and the medial parts of the Pt (Figs. DISCUSSION In this study small injections of tracers into restricted areas of the OMPFC were used to show patterns of labeling within the thalamus. In addition this study is the first to place small anterograde and retrograde tracer injections into the dorsal midline of the primate thalamus with little or no involvement of neighboring nuclei. AT: Distribution of labeled neurons in the thalamus following retrograde tracer injections into orbital/medial network area 13a (A) and orbital network areas 11l 13m and Ial (FKP). In OM15 (A) an injection into area 13a which is associated with both orbital and medial networks labeled neurons specifically in the Pt (BE) and the medial part of the Pcn (BC). Following injections into orbital network areas midline and intralaminar thalamic nuclei are relatively void of labeled neurons although there are many labeled neurons in the MD. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License Retrograde tracer injections into the OMPFC showed that the Pa projects specifically to area 25 (and to a lesser extent area 32) on the medial wall whereas the Pt projects preferentially to areas 13a and 14c along the gyrus rectus at the ventromedial corner of the frontal lobe. These were largely confirmed by anterograde tracer injections into the dorsal midline of the thalamus Fig. AO: Distribution of labeled varicosities in the thalamus following anterograde tracer injections into medial networks areas. Case numbers and injection sites are shown in the left column (AFK) with the pattern of labeled varicosities in the thalamus shown at four rostral-caudal levels to the right. AD: Darkfield photomicrographs of two anterograde tracer injections into medial network areas and the resulting label in dorsal midline thalamus. In case OM49 an injection of biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) into area 25 (A) resulted in labeled fibers and varicosities in both the Pa and Pt (B). In case OM19 an injection of 3 H-leucine into area 13a (C) which is associated with medial and orbital networks resulted in a concentration of silver grains specifically in the Pt (D). AT: Distribution of labeled varicosities in the thalamus following anterograde tracer injections into orbital/medial network area 12o (A) and orbital network areas 11l 12m and 13l (FKP). In OM31 (A) an injection into area 12o which is associated with both orbital and medial networks labeled varicosities specifically in the Cim (DE). Note the lack of labeling in midline and intralaminar thalamic nuclei (GJL OQT) following injections into orbital network areas (FKP; compare with Fig. Anterograde tracer injections into the OMPFC indicated a similar pattern in projections from the cortex to the midline thalamus. Again these results were largely confirmed by experiments with retrograde tracer injections in the dorsal midline thalamus. Other midline thalamic structures also project to the medial network especially the rostral part of the Re where a high density of labeled neurons was found following a retrograde tracer injection into areas 25/14c (Fig. Photomicrographs of anterograde tracer BDA (A) and retrograde tracer CtB (D) injections into the dorsal midline with adjacent Nissl-stained sections (BE) (see Fig. 14CD for drawings of injection sites). Only the Cim a narrow nucleus squeezed between the MD on the two sides showed substantial transported label following injections into orbital network areas (Fig. The present results used experiments with small tracer injections into the prefrontal cortex to define the specificity of the connections of MITN in monkeys particularly in relation to the medial prefrontal network. Neurons in midline nuclei were labeled following injections of the retrograde tracer horseradish peroxidase into areas in the medial prefrontal cortex (areas 32 25 and 14; Vogt et al. 1991; Dermon and Barbas 1994) and fibers were found in the midline following anterograde tracer injections into area 25 (Freedman et al. In contrast only a few labeled neurons were found in the midline following retrograde tracer injections into most of the orbital cortex (Barbas et al. In the study by Dermon and Barbas (1994) a retrograde tracer injection into the caudolateral part of the orbital cortex (possibly involving areas 13l and Iai) resulted in heavy labeling in the midline nuclei Cdc Cim and Cif. Similarly in rats a retrograde tracer injection into the lateral orbital cortex resulted in virtually no labeled cells in MITN (Reep et al. AF: Distribution of labeled axonal varicosities in the OMPFC following an anterograde tracer injection into the dorsal midline thalamus in OM67 (see Figs. 11A and 14C for injection site). The labeling in area 24b is likely due to involvement of the anteromedial nucleus (AM) in the injection site (see Results). AF: Distribution of labeled neurons in the OMPFC following a retrograde tracer injection into the dorsal midline thalamus in OM64 (see Figs. 11D and 14D for injection site). Unfolded maps of the prefrontal cortex showing the distribution of labeled varicosities (A) following anterograde tracer injection into the dorsal midline (C) and the distribution of labeled neurons (B) following retrograde tracer injection into the dorsal midline (D). Labeled varicosities observed in areas 24a and 24b (A) are likely due to the injection involving the Cdc and AM. 6AE shows a lack of dorsal midline labeling following retrograde tracer injection into area 24b.)""",
