We examined whether attentional modulation in the visual thalamus was quantitatively similar to that in cortex. To what extent does the thalamus contribute to, or participate in, the attentional modulation that is so widespread throughout visual cortex? Three thalamic nuclei are closely interrelated with visual cortex: the lateral geniculate nucleus, the pulvinar, and the reticular nucleus of the thalamus. The reticular nucleus of the thalamus is driven both by descending input from striate and extrastriate cortex and by branches of ascending thalamocortical axons from geniculate and pulvinar. There is thus ample opportunity for thalamic involvement in the attentional modulation found in cortex. It was thus also of interest to see which cortical pattern of modulation thalamic modulation might resemble. Recording methods and procedure Epoxy-coated tungsten and glass-coated Pt-Ir microelectrodes were used to record from thalamus and cortex, respectively. B: standardized coronal sections through left thalamus indicating regions in PI (left hatching), PL (horizontal hatching), and Pdm (vertical hatching) where recorded cells were estimated to lie. Prevalence of attentional modulation We recorded from 699 neurons in the thalamus and cortex of eight monkeys (Table 1). However, we found virtually all possible patterns of relative excitability in both thalamus and cortex with no marked preponderance of high responsiveness during fixation in any area. Proportions of cells significantly affected by behavioral state in different areas of thalamus and cortex. 224 D. B. BENDER AND M. YOUAKIM Downloaded from journals.physiology.org/journal/jn at RWTH Aachen Hochschulbibliothek (134.061.068.122) on September 12, 2023. thalamus and cortex but also subtle differences among brain areas. The most obvious similarity between thalamus and cortex was that cells in all brain regions segregated into one of two groups: those that gave stronger responses during fixation (which we call F1 cells), and those that gave weaker responses during fixation (F2 cells). Another similarity between thalamus and cortex was that (with the sole exception of Pdm) there were roughly similar 1 If p is a unit vector normal to the discriminant plane, and d is a unit vector on the main diagonal, and ri is the unit response vector of the ith cell in a brain area, then we chose the p for that area to maximize ~ i ~p z ri! In the thalamus, percent variability was least in the LGN (average m 5 0.25) where attentional modulation was undetectable (see Fig. Viewed in this way, both thalamic and cortical areas were essentially the same in their magnitude of attentional modulation. The signal-to-noise ratio was roughly constant, to within 610%, for all areas, in both thalamus and cortex. However, the commonality in prevalence and signal-to-noise ratio of attention across all brain areas suggests a more complex genesis, involving cooperative reciprocal interactions between pulvinar and cortex, with neither thalamus nor cortex playing the dominant role. Perhaps a degree of compartmentalization or channeling within those interactions might account for the close similarity of modulation seen for such corticothalamic pairs as V2-PL and V4/PMPI. Both innervate the thalamic and cortical areas we studied, and both can modulate cell excitability through a variety of different mechanisms that could easily account for the effects of state we saw (McCormick 1989, 1992; McCormick et al.

To this end we performed immunohistochemistry for dopamine and the dopamine transporter in the thalamus of macaque monkeys and humans to generate maps, in the stereotaxic coronal plane, of the distribution of dopaminergic axons. Postmortem biochemical studies showed the presence of dopamine in the thalamus of macaques (Brown et al., 1979; Goldman-Rakic and Brown, 1981; Pifl et al., 1990, 1991) and human subjects (Oke and Adams, 1987). Positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand studies have also demonstrated the presence of the dopamine transporter (DAT) (Wang et al., 1995; Halldin et al., 1996; Helfenbein et al., 1999; Brownell et al., 2003) and of D2-like receptors (Farde et al., 1997; Langer et al., 1999; Okubo et al., 1999; Brownell et al., 2003; Rieck et al., 2004) in the human and macaque thalamus. Finally, an immunohistochemical study using anti-DAT antibodies detected the presence of dopaminergic axons in the mediodorsal nucleus (MD) of the macaque thalamus (Melchitzky and Lewis, 2001). Our group has recently defined the primate thalamic dopaminergic system based on our findings of dopaminergic axons throughout the human and macaque monkey thalamus and of dopaminergic cell groups projecting to the macaque thalamus (Sánchez-González et al., 2005). Using retrograde tracing techniques in the macaque brain, we showed that dopamine thalamic innervation, unlike that of the striatum and the cerebral cortex, has a multiple origin in the hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray matter (PAG), mesencephalon, and the lateral parabrachial nucleus. The purpose of the present study was to analyze in detail the distribution and morphology of dopaminergic axons in the macaque and human thalamus. Thus, here we provide detailed maps of the normal dopamine innervation of the primate thalamus using immunohistochemistry against dopamine (macaque thalamus) and DAT (macaque and human thalamus). Indeed, biochemical and PET radioligand studies have described thalamic abnormalities in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) treated parkinsonian macaque monkeys related to dopamine, DAT and D2-like receptors (Pifl et al., 1990, 1991; Brownell et al., 2003). Materials and methods Tissue preparation The maps of the macaque brain were drawn from two young adult female macaques (Macaca nemestrina), weighing 4.6 kg and 5.6 kg. Additional tissue from the thalamus of another four macaques (one female and three males, M. nemestrina and Macaca mulatta) weighing between 4.7 kg and 7.2 kg was also studied. The macaque experiments were approved by the Bioethics Committee of the Universidad Autónoma de Madrid. The macaque processed for dopamine immunohistochemistry was perfused with 1% sodium metabisulfite (MBS; S1516; Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) in cacodylate buffer (0.05 M, pH 6) followed by the fixative: 1% MBS and 5% glutaraldehyde diluted in cacodylate buffer (0.1 M, pH 7.4). The remaining macaques, destined for DAT immunohistochemistry, were perfused with saline, followed by 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate buffer (PB, 0.1 M, pH 7.4) and a series of PB sucrose solutions (5–20%). Coronal plane 0 in the macaque brains corresponds to the interaural plane. The blocks from the macaque brains holding the thalamus and the primary motor cortex and the small blocks from the human brains containing the thalamus and primary motor and prefrontal cortices were cut on a freezing microtome into coronal sections of 40 μm (monkey) and 50 μm (human) thickness. Immunohistochemistry Dopamine immunostaining Dopamine immunohistochemistry was only performed in macaque tissue because, as a result of dopamine instability, it requires a cumbersome in vivo perfusion and processing protocol. (1999) was used for DAT immunohistochemical detection in both the macaque and human tissue. This protocol enhanced the DAT immunoreaction in macaque tissue. Macaque monkey brain tissue Free-floating sections from the macaques perfused with paraformaldehyde were sequentially incubated as follows: 1. Antigen retrieval: the same procedure as for the macaque tissue. Parcellation of the macaque thalamus followed Olszewski (1952) with some modifications (Cavada et al., 1995; Rico and Cavada, 1998a). Parcellation of the human thalamus followed Hirai and Jones (1989); some human thalamic nuclei have been identified with the names used by Olszewski in the macaque thalamus (see list of abbreviations). Because the density of the dopamine innervation in some thalamic nuclei appears to be as high as or higher than in the frontal cortical areas with a known dense and functionally relevant dopamine innervation (Doudet et al., 1990; Sawaguchi and Goldman-Rakic, 1991, 1994; Williams and Goldman-Rakic, 1993; Lewis et al., 2001), we have also charted the distributions of dopamine-ir and DAT-ir axons in representative cortical sections of the macaque primary motor cortex (Brodmann’s area 4—BA 4) as well as the distribution of DAT-ir axons in the human BA 4 and prefrontal area BA 46. Topographic and cytoarchitectonic criteria were used to locate BA 4 in the macaque and human brains (Zilles et al., 1995) and BA 46 in the human brain (Rajkowska and Goldman-Rakic, 1995). Distribution of dopamine-ir and DAT-ir axons in the macaque monkey thalamus Both dopamine and DAT immunolabeling were unevenly distributed in the macaque dorsal thalamus, with some nuclei, or portions thereof, holding very dense plexuses of -ir axons, and other nuclei holding very few -ir axons. Dopamine immunolabeling in the macaque thalamus was mainly concentrated in midline nuclei (Fig. As in the macaque thalamus, labeling density in the human MD was notably heterogeneous. Similarly to the macaque thalamus, the LD presented weak immunolabeling (Fig. As in the macaque thalamus, DAT immunolabeling in the human thalamus was very weak in most of the intralaminar nuclei (particularly the Pcn and centromedian nucleus—CnMd) and in the primary sensory relay nuclei (VPM, anterior and posterior part of ventral posterior lateral nucleus—VPLa and VPLp, GLd, and medial geniculate nucleus—GM) (Fig. The number of DAT-ir axons in coronal sections of the human thalamus was greater than in the macaque thalamus. As in the macaque thalamus, DAT immunolabeling was observed in R, where very dense patches were present mostly in the rostral and dorsal regions, the ZI and the habenular complex (medial and lateral habenular nucleus—Hm and Hl) (Figs. Some of the thick non-varicose axons were short and had a peculiar spiral shape, like a ringlet; they were mostly observed in Re in the macaque thalamus and in ventromedial MD in the human thalamus. Discussion This study provides detailed coronal maps of the dopamine innervation of the macaque and human thalamus as revealed by dopamine and DAT immunolabeling. This is consistent with the following data: (1) the population of macaque dopaminergic neurons projecting to the midline thalamus is four to six times larger than that projecting to non-midline nuclei (Sánchez-González et al., 2005), and (2) over 80% of the dopaminergic neurons that project to the midline thalamus do not express DAT, whereas over 80% of the dopaminergic neurons projecting to the non-midline MD and LP nuclei are in dopaminergic groups that express DAT (Sánchez-González et al., 2005). A similar mismatch between dopamine and DAT immunolabeling was found in the most medial part of the macaque Pul M. Tract-tracing studies are needed to determine whether most of the dopaminergic neurons projecting to this part of Pul M are devoid of or have a very low DAT content. The observation of extensive and abundant axonal profiles that are immunopositive for two dopaminergic markers throughout the human and macaque thalamus, as shown in the present report, together with the demonstration of the origin of these axons in the dopaminergic cell groups of the monkey brain (Sánchez-González et al., 2005) led us to describe and define the novel “thalamic dopaminergic system” (Sánchez-González et al., 2005; Craven, 2005). Among these nuclei, MD shows some of the densest areas of DAT-ir axons in the macaque and human thalamus. The macaque MDm is mainly connected with the orbital prefrontal cortex, the MDv and adjacent portion of MDl are connected with the ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, and the MDp projects throughout the prefrontal cortex including orbitofrontal, lateral and medial areas (Goldman-Rakic and Porrino, 1985; Cavada et al., 2000). Important dopamine innervation is present in the macaque prefrontal cortex itself (Lewis et al., 2001), where it is functionally relevant for working memory (Brozoski et al., 1979; Sawaguchi and Goldman-Rakic, 1991, 1994).

We recently defined the thalamic dopaminergic system in primates; it arises from numerous dopaminergic cell groups and selectively targets numerous thalamic nuclei. Given the central position of the thalamus in subcortical and cortical interplay, and the functional relevance of dopamine neuromodulation in the brain, detailing dopamine distribution in the thalamus should supply important information. To this end we performed immunohistochemistry for dopamine and the dopamine transporter in the thalamus of macaque monkeys and humans to generate maps, in the stereotaxic coronal plane, of the distribution of dopaminergic axons. The dopamine innervation of the thalamus follows the same pattern in both species and is most dense in midline limbic nuclei, the mediodorsal and lateral posterior association nuclei, and in the ventral lateral and ventral anterior motor nuclei. This distribution suggests that thalamic dopamine has a prominent role in emotion, attention, cognition and complex somatosensory and visual processing, as well as in motor control. Most thalamic dopaminergic axons are thin and varicose and target both the neuropil and small blood vessels, suggesting that, besides neuronal modulation, thalamic dopamine may have a direct influence on microcirculation. The maps provided here should be a useful reference in future experimental and neuroimaging studies aiming at clarifying the role of the thalamic dopaminergic system in health and in conditions involving brain dopamine, including Parkinson’s disease, drug addiction and schizophrenia. Keywords Dopamine Thalamus Monkey Human Primate Dopamine transporter Parkinson Schizophrenia Addiction Introduction The thalamus is made up of multiple nuclei relaying information from subcortical centers or from other cortices to the cerebral cortex (Sherman and Guillery, 2005), as well as the striatum, the nucleus accumbens and the amygdala (Steriade et al., 1997). In addition to specific subcortical and cortical afferents, the primate thalamus receives axons containing the neuromodulators acetylcholine (Heckers et al., 1992), histamine (Manning et al., 1996), serotonin (Morrison and Foote, 1986; Lavoie and Parent, 1991), and the catecholamines adrenaline (Rico and Cavada, 1998a), noradrenaline (Morrison and Foote, 1986; Ginsberg et al., 1993) and dopamine (Sánchez-González et al., 2005). Until recently, the existence of significant dopamine innervation in the primate thalamus has been largely ignored, probably because dopamine innervation of the rodent thalamus is very scant (Groenewegen, 1988; Papadopoulos and Parnavelas, 1990). However, fragmentary data scattered through the literature endorse the presence of dopamine innervation in the primate thalamus. Postmortem biochemical studies showed the presence of dopamine in the thalamus of macaques (Brown et al., 1979; Goldman-Rakic and Brown, 1981; Pifl et al., 1990, 1991) and human subjects (Oke and Adams, 1987). Later, receptor binding and in situ hybridization analyses detected the presence of dopamine D2-like (Joyce et al., 1991; Kessler et al., 1993; Hall et al., 1996; Langer et al., 1999; Rieck et al., 2004) and D3-like receptors (Gurevich and Joyce, 1999) in several human thalamic nuclei. Positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand studies have also demonstrated the presence of the dopamine transporter (DAT) (Wang et al., 1995; Halldin et al., 1996; Helfenbein et al., 1999; Brownell et al., 2003) and of D2-like receptors (Farde et al., 1997; Langer et al., 1999; Okubo et al., 1999; Brownell et al., 2003; Rieck et al., 2004) in the human and macaque thalamus. In the course of PET studies focusing on schizophrenia, D2- and D3-like radioligand binding was also found in the thalamus of control subjects (Talvik et al., 2003; Yasuno et al., 2004). Finally, an immunohistochemical study using anti-DAT antibodies detected the presence of dopaminergic axons in the mediodorsal nucleus (MD) of the macaque thalamus (Melchitzky and Lewis, 2001). Our group has recently defined the primate thalamic dopaminergic system based on our findings of dopaminergic axons throughout the human and macaque monkey thalamus and of dopaminergic cell groups projecting to the macaque thalamus (Sánchez-González et al., 2005). Using retrograde tracing techniques in the macaque brain, we showed that dopamine thalamic innervation, unlike that of the striatum and the cerebral cortex, has a multiple origin in the hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray matter (PAG), mesencephalon, and the lateral parabrachial nucleus. In addition to their heterogeneous origin, we also observed an uneven distribution of the dopaminergic axons throughout the thalamus. The purpose of the present study was to analyze in detail the distribution and morphology of dopaminergic axons in the macaque and human thalamus. Thus, here we provide detailed maps of the normal dopamine innervation of the primate thalamus using immunohistochemistry against dopamine (macaque thalamus) and DAT (macaque and human thalamus). Considering the growing interest in neuroimaging studies of the human thalamus (Niemann et al., 2000), we offer the maps in the stereotaxic coronal plane to facilitate their use in future experimental and clinical neuroimaging studies examining the thalamic distribution of dopamine, its receptors or DAT. Indeed, biochemical and PET radioligand studies have described thalamic abnormalities in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) treated parkinsonian macaque monkeys related to dopamine, DAT and D2-like receptors (Pifl et al., 1990, 1991; Brownell et al., 2003). Moreover, biochemical and PET radioligand studies have also demonstrated alterations in the thalamus of schizophrenic patients related to dopamine and its receptors (Oke and Adams, 1987; Talvik et al., 2003; Yasuno et al., 2004). Additional tissue from the thalamus of another four macaques (one female and three males, M. nemestrina and Macaca mulatta) weighing between 4.7 kg and 7.2 kg was also studied. The maps of the human thalamus were drawn from the 58-year-old patient. For microtome sectioning, smaller blocks containing the thalamus and the primary motor and prefrontal cortices were obtained. The blocks from the macaque brains holding the thalamus and the primary motor cortex and the small blocks from the human brains containing the thalamus and primary motor and prefrontal cortices were cut on a freezing microtome into coronal sections of 40 μm (monkey) and 50 μm (human) thickness. Data analysis and map elaboration The dopamine-ir and DAT-ir axons of the thalamus were drawn using a computerized analysis system attached to a Zeiss Axioskop microscope (Oberkochen, Germany). Other elements, like the outer borders of the thalamus and the blood vessels, were also traced as references. In order to identify the thalamic nuclei and trace their borders, the above drawings were routinely superimposed on the screen over the images of adjacent sections processed for AChE. The borders of the thalamus, third ventricle and blood vessels served as fiducial marks. Parcellation of the macaque thalamus followed Olszewski (1952) with some modifications (Cavada et al., 1995; Rico and Cavada, 1998a). Parcellation of the human thalamus followed Hirai and Jones (1989); some human thalamic nuclei have been identified with the names used by Olszewski in the macaque thalamus (see list of abbreviations). Because the density of the dopamine innervation in some thalamic nuclei appears to be as high as or higher than in the frontal cortical areas with a known dense and functionally relevant dopamine innervation (Doudet et al., 1990; Sawaguchi and Goldman-Rakic, 1991, 1994; Williams and Goldman-Rakic, 1993; Lewis et al., 2001), we have also charted the distributions of dopamine-ir and DAT-ir axons in representative cortical sections of the macaque primary motor cortex (Brodmann’s area 4—BA 4) as well as the distribution of DAT-ir axons in the human BA 4 and prefrontal area BA 46. No immunolabeling of neuronal bodies or axons was observed in the brain stem, thalamus or other brain regions when the primary antibodies were not used in the immunostaining protocols. Distribution of dopamine-ir and DAT-ir axons in the macaque monkey thalamus Both dopamine and DAT immunolabeling were unevenly distributed in the macaque dorsal thalamus, with some nuclei, or portions thereof, holding very dense plexuses of -ir axons, and other nuclei holding very few -ir axons. Indeed, in sections from comparable thalamic levels, we drew 40–50 times more DAT-ir than dopamine-ir axons. Dopamine immunolabeling in the macaque thalamus was mainly concentrated in midline nuclei (Fig. Outside the dorsal thalamus, both dopamine and DAT immunolabeling were present in the reticular nucleus (R), zona incerta (ZI) and habenular complex (Hm and Hlpc) (Figs. It is noteworthy that the density of both dopamine and DAT immunolabeling in the most heavily innervated dorsal thalamic nuclei is as high as or higher than in BA 4, the cortical area with the densest dopamine innervation (Lewis et al., 2001) (Figs. Distribution of DAT-ir axons in the human thalamus Dorsal thalamus immunolabeling was densest in regions of the midline nuclei CeM and medioventral (MV), the association nuclei MD and LP, and in the motor nuclei ventral anterior (VA), including its magnocellular part (VAmc), and ventral lateral, anterior and posterior parts (VLa and VLp) (Figs. As in the macaque thalamus, labeling density in the human MD was notably heterogeneous. In the human thalamus the medioventral zone of MD exhibited very dense immunolabeling; from this zone labeling density gradually decreased along a medioventral to laterodorsal axis (Fig. Similarly to the macaque thalamus, the LD presented weak immunolabeling (Fig. As in the macaque thalamus, DAT immunolabeling in the human thalamus was very weak in most of the intralaminar nuclei (particularly the Pcn and centromedian nucleus—CnMd) and in the primary sensory relay nuclei (VPM, anterior and posterior part of ventral posterior lateral nucleus—VPLa and VPLp, GLd, and medial geniculate nucleus—GM) (Fig. Similarly, no immunolabeling was present in neuronal bodies of the human thalamus. The number of DAT-ir axons in coronal sections of the human thalamus was greater than in the macaque thalamus. For further details about the labeling present in each human thalamic nucleus and for a comparative analysis between nuclei the reader is referred to the maps in Fig. As in the macaque thalamus, DAT immunolabeling was observed in R, where very dense patches were present mostly in the rostral and dorsal regions, the ZI and the habenular complex (medial and lateral habenular nucleus—Hm and Hl) (Figs. Interestingly, the densest DAT immunolabeling in the thalamic nuclei CeM, MD, LP, VA, VLa and VLp appeared denser than DAT immunolabeling in BA 4 and BA 46 (compare Fig. Some of the thick non-varicose axons were short and had a peculiar spiral shape, like a ringlet; they were mostly observed in Re in the macaque thalamus and in ventromedial MD in the human thalamus. Dopamine and DAT immunohistochemistry revealed them in several thalamic nuclei, including MD and LP, of both species. Discussion This study provides detailed coronal maps of the dopamine innervation of the macaque and human thalamus as revealed by dopamine and DAT immunolabeling. In both species the most densely innervated thalamic nuclei are midline limbic nuclei, the association nuclei MD and LP, and the motor ventral nuclei (VLo, VLc and VPLo—monkey, VLa and VLp—human); in the human thalamus, the motor nuclei VA and VAmc are also densely innervated (Figs. We expect that the maps provided here will be useful for future neuroimaging and experimental studies focusing on the dopamine innervation of the primate thalamus. The high densities of DAT immunolabeling revealed in the human thalamus are particularly significant considering that they were observed in subjects well over 50 years old. It is possible that cell loss is also present in other dopaminergic cell groups including those projecting to the thalamus (Sánchez-González et al., 2005). If this is so, then the densities of dopamine innervation in the thalamus of younger human subjects might be higher than shown by the maps in Fig. The DAT content in the dopamine innervation of the monkey thalamus appears to be heterogeneous. These observations suggest that the midline nuclei hold the richest dopamine innervation and that the majority of midline dopaminergic axons do not express DAT (or their DAT expression is below the detection level of current techniques), whereas DAT-expressing axons abound in non-midline nuclei, that is, throughout most of the primate thalamus. This is consistent with the following data: (1) the population of macaque dopaminergic neurons projecting to the midline thalamus is four to six times larger than that projecting to non-midline nuclei (Sánchez-González et al., 2005), and (2) over 80% of the dopaminergic neurons that project to the midline thalamus do not express DAT, whereas over 80% of the dopaminergic neurons projecting to the non-midline MD and LP nuclei are in dopaminergic groups that express DAT (Sánchez-González et al., 2005). The differences in DAT content of dopaminergic terminals in midline versus non-midline thalamic nuclei probably correlate with functional differences between these two thalamic domains. Even though we know neither DAT ultrastructural location nor dopamine release mechanisms in the thalamus, the abundance of DAT in non-midline nuclei suggests that extracellular dopamine levels are more tightly controlled by reuptake mechanisms there than in the thalamic midline. The present findings confirm and expand previous data on the existence of dopamine in the primate thalamus obtained by biochemical methods (Brown et al., 1979; Goldman-Rakic and Brown, 1981; Oke and Adams, 1987; Pifl et al., 1990; Pifl et al., 1991), receptor binding (Joyce et al., 1991; Kessler et al., 1993; Hall et al., 1996; Gurevich and Joyce, 1999; Langer et al., 1999; Rieck et al., 2004), PET radioligands (Wang et al., 1995; Halldin et al., 1996; Farde et al., 1997; Helfenbein et al., 1999; Langer et al., 1999; Okubo et al., 1999; Brownell et al., 2003; Rieck et al., 2004) and immunohistochemistry against DAT (Melchitzky and Lewis, 2001). Initially, thalamic dopamine was considered a precursor of noradrenaline (Oke et al., 1997). This interpretation, together with the fact that the rodent thalamus bears a weak dopamine innervation (Groenewegen, 1988; Papadopoulos and Parnavelas, 1990), has, until recently, probably precluded the consideration of dopamine as a genuine neurotransmitter in the primate thalamus. The observation of extensive and abundant axonal profiles that are immunopositive for two dopaminergic markers throughout the human and macaque thalamus, as shown in the present report, together with the demonstration of the origin of these axons in the dopaminergic cell groups of the monkey brain (Sánchez-González et al., 2005) led us to describe and define the novel “thalamic dopaminergic system” (Sánchez-González et al., 2005; Craven, 2005). Dopaminergic axons target both thalamic neuropil and blood vessels We have identified four types of dopaminergic axons, the most frequent being the thin varicose axons found in thalamic neuropil and surrounding many small blood vessels. Similar observations have been reported for the cholinergic and adrenergic axons that innervate the primate thalamus (Heckers et al., 1992; Rico and Cavada, 1998a) and for corticothalamic axons, some of which also lie adjacent to small blood vessels in rats and cats (Feig and Guillery, 2000). It is likely that the thin varicose axons arise from the thick non-varicose axons, so the former can be considered the terminal axonal branches of the thalamic dopaminergic system. The varicosities observed under light microscopy may contain “Round Small” synaptic terminal profiles, the ultrastructural type of synaptic terminal described in the modulator afferents to the thalamus (Sherman and Guillery, 2005). Further ultrastructural studies are needed to assess this interpretation and to locate the dopamine-ir and DAT-ir post-synaptic elements in the primate thalamus. The presence of dopamine-ir and DAT-ir axons in the walls of small thalamic blood vessels merits attention as it indicates that dopaminergic axons may regulate thalamic microcirculation. Thus, the dopamine innervation of the primate thalamus might influence the local blood flow through its modulation of neuronal activity and also act directly on the caliber and permeability of microvessels. Functional implications of thalamic dopamine The local neural actions of thalamic dopamine would depend on the type of release and reuptake, the dopamine receptors present, the cells targeted and the interactions with other neurotransmitters. Elucidating the role of each of these mechanisms is needed to understand the functional role of dopamine in the thalamus. We can, however, infer the role of thalamic dopamine from the analysis of its distribution. Indeed, the local actions of thalamic dopamine will produce distant effects depending on the efferent projections of the innervated nuclei. Analysis of Table 1A indicates that thalamic dopamine acting on the densely innervated midline nuclei would have a widespread influence over the cerebral cortex, specifically onto limbic and frontal association areas, non-primary motor areas, and posterior parietal and temporal association areas. Also the dorsal striatum, nucleus accumbens and amygdala are likely targets for the modulation exerted by thalamic midline dopamine. This pattern of connections by midline nuclei suggests that midline thalamic dopamine, which is poor in DAT, may modulate emotion, attention, motor function, complex sensory or sensory-motor functions and cognition. The prefrontal cortex is one of the most relevant targets of several thalamic nuclei innervated by dopamine (Tables 1A and 1B ). Among these nuclei, MD shows some of the densest areas of DAT-ir axons in the macaque and human thalamus. Among the thalamic nuclei that receive a moderate dopamine innervation are the anterior and pulvinar groups. Through the anterior nuclei, thalamic dopamine may influence the cingulate and anterior association cortices, the premotor cortex, the posterior parietal cortex and the dorsal striatum (Table 1A). The motor thalamic nuclei are among the most densely innervated by dopamine. These nuclei, which comprise the “classic” motor thalamus (VA and ventral lateral nuclei) as well as the intralaminar nuclei and portions of MD, receive nigral, pallidal and cerebellar afferents (Asanuma et al., 1983; Ilinsky and Kultas-Ilinsky, 1987; Ilinsky et al., 1985) and project to different motor cortices (Table 1B). VAmc and the paralamellar portion of MDl receive the bulk of the nigral projection to the thalamus (Ilinsky et al., 1985) as well as the projections from the deep layers of the superior colliculus (Harting et al., 1980); their most relevant cortical target is the frontal eye field, but they are also connected with other non-primary motor cortices, the striatum and the prefrontal cortex (Table 1A and 1B). Thus, thalamic dopamine may modulate oculomotor function through the dopamine innervation of VAmc, which is especially dense in the human thalamus. The pallidal projection territory in the monkey thalamus mostly comprises the parvocellular part of the ventral anterior nucleus (VApc), the ventromedial part of VA (VAvm), VLo and CnMd (Ilinsky and Kultas-Ilinsky, 1987; Sakai et al., 1996, 2000). Finally, the cerebellar projection to the monkey thalamus is distributed mostly through VLc, VPLo, area X, the lateral portion of CL and MDp (Asanuma et al., 1983; Sakai et al., 1996, 2000). In sum, considering their intense connections with primary and non-primary motor cortices, we suggest that thalamic dopamine in the nuclei with pallidal and cerebellar afferents modulates the execution and planning of motor actions. Recapitulating, we postulate that the primate thalamic dopaminergic system is in a key position to modulate emotion, attention, complex somatosensory and visual function, cognition and movement, but does not seem relevant to sensory relay toward the cerebral cortex. The dopamine innervation of R, a nucleus with a development and connections that are different from those of the dorsal thalamic nuclei discussed so far, deserves comment. R receives non-reciprocal projections from the cortex and subcortical structures and is reciprocally connected with all the nuclei of the dorsal thalamus; each region of R is connected with a given dorsal thalamus nucleus (Jones, 1975). Modulating afferents to the thalamus from the cortex and subcortical structures send a collateral to the R region connected to the thalamic nucleus that they are targeting (Steriade et al., 1997; Sherman and Guillery, 2005; Zikopoulos and Barbas, 2006). Dopamine-ir and DAT-ir axons in R are concentrated in the anterior and dorsal sectors of the human and monkey thalamus. Thus, it is possible that the dopaminergic axons that target the dorsal thalamus also branch to the R region connected with the thalamic nucleus targeted by the same axons. This would fit with the known connectivity pattern of other “modulators” of thalamic transmission in mammals, i.e., cortical layer 6 afferents, and cholinergic, GABAergic and possibly other aminergic afferents (Sherman and Guillery, 2005). Thalamic dopamine in neurological and psychiatric disorders Among the major neurological and psychiatric diseases associated with abnormal dopamine neurotransmission (Carlsson, 2002; Hornykiewicz, 2002), Parkinson’s disease (PD) and schizophrenia may present thalamic alterations that can now be discussed in the scope of a thalamic dopaminergic system. Other dopaminergic cell groups in the mesencephalon and the hypothalamus also appear to be involved in both human PD and the experimental parkinsonian condition induced by MPTP in monkeys (Javoy-Agid et al., 1981; Javoy-Agid et al., 1984; Schneider et al., 1987; German et al., 1988; Hirsch et al., 1988; Pifl et al., 1990, 1991). Among these groups, the VTA, retrorubral and PAG dopaminergic cell groups, as well as several dopaminergic hypothalamic cell groups, project to the primate thalamus (Sánchez-González et al., 2005). Thus, it is likely that the dopamine innervation of the thalamus is reduced in PD and MPTP parkinsonian monkeys. Data from MPTP parkinsonian monkeys support this suggestion: dopamine is significantly reduced in the MD and CnMd (Pifl et al., 1990, 1991) and DAT binding is significantly decreased in the thalamus (Brownell et al., 2003). If thalamic dopamine is reduced in PD, the abnormal neurotransmission through the motor thalamic nuclei may contribute to the motor symptoms of this disease and non-motor symptoms may be related to decreased dopamine in other thalamic nuclei. Sleep may be altered by abnormal thalamic neurotransmission in R and MD, which are critically involved in sleep regulation (Steriade et al., 1997). In schizophrenic patients, brain imaging and postmortem studies have analyzed thalamic volumes, and thalamic perfusion and metabolism, but the findings have been contradictory and definite thalamic alterations have not been demonstrated (Clinton and Meador-Woodruff, 2004; Sim et al., 2006). Nevertheless, biochemical studies in the 80s demonstrated an elevation of thalamic dopamine in schizophrenics (Oke and Adams, 1987) and recent PET studies have found a decrease in D2-like (Yasuno et al., 2004) and both D2- and D3-like (Talvik et al., 2003) receptor binding in the medial thalamus including the MD. This suggests that an aberrant dopamine transmission in certain thalamic nuclei might underlie some symptoms in schizophrenia. The demonstration of a widespread heterogeneous dopamine innervation in the human thalamus provides an anatomical substrate for these alterations. Dopamine innervation of the thalamus could also play a role in drug addiction. Moreover, thalamic binding of cocaine analogues in non-human primates is displaced by the administration of cocaine itself. This indicates that there is a selective uptake of cocaine by thalamic dopaminergic nerve terminals (Halldin et al., 1996; Helfenbein et al., 1999). We conclude that the DAT-ir terminals in the primate thalamus mapped here are sites of action for these addictive drugs, and interestingly, studies in cocaine-dependent human subjects have suggested an association between cocaine addiction and thalamic dopamine pathways (Volkow et al., 1997, 2005). In summary, the primate thalamus receives a widespread, dense and heterogeneous dopamine innervation that is heaviest in the midline limbic nuclei, the association nuclei MD and LP and the ventral lateral and ventral anterior motor nuclei. Dopamine may well be a relevant thalamic modulator with a prominent role in emotion, attention, complex somatosensory and visual processing, motor control, cognition, and sleep regulation. The thalamic dopaminergic system may be related to the pathophysiology of PD and schizophrenia and is likely to be a relevant site of action for some drugs of addiction. Future neuroimaging studies in control and diseased individuals should help clarify the role of the thalamic dopaminergic system in health and disease.

Serially sectioned thalamic structures were recorded in electron micrographs and reconstructed in three dimensions by computer. Individual ML axon terminals form multiple synaptic contacts with segments of the proximal dendritic trees of thalamocortical relay neurons and also synapse upon the dendritic appendages of GABA-ir interneurons (local circuit neurons). The thalamic synaptic relationships of ML terminals are fundamentally different from those formed by the STT. Copyright 0 1994 Society for Neuroscience 0270-6474/94/142485-18$05.00/O jority of these spinal afferents suggests that the transmission of noxious information is probably not subject to GABAergic modulation by thalamic interneurons, in contrast to the GABAergic processing of non-noxious information carried by the ML afferents. The differences in the GABAergic circuits of the thalamus that mediate ML and STT afferent information are believed to underlie differential somatosensory processing in the forebrain. We suggest that changes in thalamic GABAergic dendritic appendages and GABA receptors following CNS injury may play a role in the genesis of some central pain states. [Key words: thalamus, somatosensory, monkey, GABA, medial lemniscus, spinothalamic tract, inhibition, interneuron, pain] Several studies of the neuronal and synaptic organization of the thalamus of monkey and of cat have revealed a complex circuitry for processing afferent information (reviewed in Ralston, 1983, 199 1; Jones, 1985). Thalamic nuclei contain two neuronal cell types: (1) the thalamocortical relay cell, usually about 20- 40 Km in cell body diameter, which projects to functionally related regions of the cerebral cortex and which constitutes approximately 75-90% of the total complement of neurons, and (2) the interneuron (local circuit neuron), which represents approximately lo-25% of the total neuronal population (Le Vay, 197 1; Hamori and Pasik, 1983) and which exhibits GABA immunoreactivity (GABA-ir; Spreafico et al., 1983). The thalamocortical relay cells lack these dendritic appendages. The first electron microscopic study of the primate thalamus (LGN, Colonnier and Guillery, 1964) showed that the retinal afferents contained rounded synaptic vesicles and were the largest synaptic profile present (designated RL profiles). These relationships between afferent, relay cell, and GABA-ir appendages presumably serve a fundamental aspect of information transfer in the thalamus, in which the afferent axon transmits an excitatory message to the relay cell and to the GABAergic appendages, resulting in feedforward GABAergic inhibition of the relay cell by the intemeuronal dendritic appendages (Pare et al., 199 1). Two major somatosensory afferent pathways, the medial lemniscus (ML) and the spinothalamic tract (STT), project to the ventroposterolateral nucleus (VPLc; Olszewski, 1952) of the thalamus in the primate (Boivie, 1978, 1979). Physiological studies of macaque thalamic neurons (Chung et al., 1986b) found that more than half of the VPLc neurons responded exclusively or preferentially to noxious mechanical stimuli, the remainder responding in varying degrees to nonnoxious or to noxious stimuli. Lemniscal and spinal projections to the thalamus are modulated in the dorsal horn and dorsal column nuclei, respectively, and then are subject to modulation in the thalamus. In this study, the synaptic relationships formed by lemniscal afferents with thalamocortical relay cells and GABA-ir intemeurons were examined by electron microscopy and compared to those of spinal afferents, following labeling of the afferents by WGAHRP. We demonstrate that the thalamic circuitry serving the pathways. In the seven animals used for spinothalamic projections, the cervical (n = 4) or the lumbar (n = 3) enlargement of the spinal cord was surgically exposed after a laminectomy and 5% WGA-HRP was pressure injected into the dorsal horn of the cord, medial to the dorsal root entry zone. The brain and spinal cord were removed and the thalamus was blocked in the stereotaxic plane (Olszewski, 1952) and the injected segments of the medulla and cord cut into transverse blocks. The injection sites and the thalamus were serially sectioned with a Vibratome at 100 pm thickness. Sections of brainstem, cord, and thalamus were incubated histochemically for the reaction for HRP for light microscopy (Mesulam, 1978) and separately for electron microscopy. For light microscopy, cord, medulla, and thalamus sections were mounted on slides in serial order to determine the extent of the injection and projection sites, respectively. Adjacent sections of thalamus were stained for Nissl substance. After reaction with TMB, specific regions of somatosensory thalamus demonstrating anterograde axonal transport were identified and dissected out of the section and osmicated overnight (Henry et al., 1985). Control sections for our technique were incubated in a solution from which the primary antibody had been omitted, which resulted in the absence of the goldlabeled antibody over thalamic structures. Other regions of the somatosensory thalamus receiving spinal afferents (the posterior group, Po/SG; and the central lateral nucleus, Cl) were also examined. Spinal injections resulted in discrete clusters of terminal axonal arbors in the somatotopically appropriate region of the VPLc nucleus of the thalamus, upper extremity representation being medial to that of the lower extremity. We also examined the synaptic relationships of STT terminals in Po/SG and in Cl nucleus of the intralaminar thalamus. In contrast, the substantial majority of lemniscal terminals form synaptic triadic and glomerular arrangements with GABA-ir presynaptic dendrites and the dendritic shafts ofthalamocortical relay neurons. Differences in the synaptic relationships of sensory afferents with interneurons have.also been described in the visual thalamus. Therefore, differential GABAergic processing of sensory signals may be a general mechanism used by the thalamus to modulate selectively the information carried by these afferents. Neuronal cell types in VPLc The macaque monkey is similar to the cat in that the major thalamic nuclei contain two principal classes of neurons: thalamocortical relay cells, which project to the appropriate cortical target, and interneurons (local circuit), the processes of which are confined to the nucleus of origin (reviewed in Jones, 1985). The role of interneurons in thalamic mechanisms GABA-containing intemeurons are believed to be able to release their neurotransmitter both from their dendritic appendages and from their axon (Ralston, 1971). Whether all thalamic interneurons have axons is debatable. The most thorough study of the functional properties of the GABAergic presynaptic dendritic appendages of interneurons in processing afferent information in the thalamus is that of Pare et al. They chose this nucleus as a model because it receives few GABAergic axons from the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), which might otherwise obscure the effects of GABA released by interneurons. They described a triphasic series of IPSPs in relay cells following stimulation of mammillothalamic afferents: a short-latency, brief- -duration IPSP (designated a) that they concluded was due to feedforward inhibition mediated by the triadic synaptic relationships between mammillary afferents, intemeuronal presynaptic dendrites, and relay cells; and two longer-latency, more prolonged IPSPs (designated A and B) that they assumed were evoked by the axons of interneurons. are applicable to the primate somatosensory thalamus, it is likely that the information transfer between STT afferents and relay cells, relatively unmodulated by GABAergic presynaptic dendrites, is substantially different than that evoked by stimulation of the ML. Is there convergence of ML and STT projections onto single thalamic neurons? This creates a potential problem for the cerebral cortical neurons that are the recipients of information from such thalamocortical relay cells. However, the differences between the two afferent systems in synaptic interactions with GABAergic interneurons may result in distinct firing properties of relay neurons receiving ML and STT input, depending upon the degree of GABA modulation of the afferent signal, so that the cortex could distinguish between non-noxious and noxious information carried by convergent afferents upon thalamocortical cells. information relayed to the cortex is transmitted by separate populations of thalamocortical neurons. This is in contrast to thalamic convergence studies in the rat, in which degenerating lemniscal and HRP-labeled spinal terminals are found to be adjacent to one another, synapsing upon the same segment of dendrite in VPL (Ma et al., 1987). The question of convergence of ML and STT afferents to single thalamic neurons awaits study of the synaptic terminations of these systems upon individual, intracellularly filled VPLc neurons, in which separate branches of the dendritic arbor can be examined to determine whether both ML and STT axon terminals contact the same neuron. Thalamic circuitry and pain mechanisms Our findings raise a hypothesis concerning the genesis of the thalamic pain syndrome (Dejerine and Roussy, 1906) also known as central post-stroke pain, which is characterized by severe pain and abnormalities in somatic sensibility. The CNS lesion, usually vascular in origin, is not necessarily located in the thalamus but may involve diverse regions of the diencephalon or brainstem and appears to be associated with central somatosensory deafferentation, particularly of the spino-thalamo-cortical pathways (Boivie et al., 1989). One possible explanation for these painful syndromes following central lesions may be the reorganization of thalamic circuitry in response to afferent injury. It has been observed that, after lesions of lemniscal afferents to the thalamus, there is a reduction of GABA-ir presynaptic dendrites within VPLc (J. These examples indicate that CNS degeneration can lead to changes in thalamic GABAergic presynaptic dendritic appendages and postsynaptic GABA, receptors. (discussed above) have shown that the presynaptic dendritic appendages, acting via postsynaptic GABA, receptors, play a major role in setting the firing properties of thalamic neurons. Our findings suggest that, in the primate thalamic transmission system, changes in the normal GABAergic circuitry following injury may cause the cortex to misinterpret non-noxious signals that are normally GABA modified in the thalamus to arise from nonmodified noxious stimuli, potentially resulting in central pain states. Conclusions Individual dendritic segments of thalamocortical relay neurons receive projections from either ML or STT afferent axons. Approximately 84% of ML projections mediating non-noxious information to VPLc of the thalamus are involved in complex circuitry with GABA-ir interneurons, presumably modulating the effects of the ML input upon relay neurons, resulting in a rapid return of the relay cell to its resting membrane potential to permit high frequency following of the afferent input. In contrast, 85% of spinal projections to VPLc, primarily transmitting information perceived by the cortex as noxious, lack interactions with GABA-ir interneurons, and form simple axodendritic synapses upon thalamocortical relay cells. The relative lack of GABAergic modulation of the STT information would presumably result in the transmission of a different type of thalamocortical signal by neurons activated by STT, comFigure 12. Thalamocortical relav cells (TCR Cell) in VPLC receive somatosensory projections from the medial lemnisdus (ML) and from the spinothalamic tract (STT). The TCR dendritic segment that receives ML and psd synapses also receives synapses from GABA-ir axons (F), which might arise from the thalamic reticular nucleus or from interneurons. Because the majority of spinal afferents carry noxious messages, we propose that it is this information that lacks thalamic GABAergic modulation before being transmitted to the cortex. We suggesthat injury to central somatosensory pathways may elicit changes in thalamic GABA synaptic circuitry and GABA receptors to result in non-noxious peripheral stimuli being interpreted by the cortex as noxious, leading to the phenomena of central pain states.

Our goal was to determine the proportion of labeled neurons contributing to this projection system by the mediodorsal (MD) nucleus compared to those distributed in other thalamic nuclei, and to investigate the relationship of thalamic projections to specific architectonic areas of the prefrontal cortex. The results showed that MD included a clear majority (over 80%) of all thalamic neurons directed to some prefrontal cortices (areas 11,46, and 8); it contributed just over half to some others (areas 12 and 321, and less than a third to area 14. However, the most striking findings establish a relationship between thalamic origin and laminar definition of the prefrontal target areas. Most thalamic neurons directed to lateral prefrontal cortices, which are characterized by a high degree of laminar definition (areas 46 and 81, originated in the parvicellular and multiform subdivisions of MD, and only a few were found in other nuclei. In contrast, orbital and medial cortices, which have a low degree of laminar differentiation, were targeted by the magnocellular subdivision of MD and by numerous other limbic thalamic nuclei, including the midline and the anterior. Thus topographic specificity in the origin of thalamic projections increased as the laminar definition of the target area increased. Selective destruction of caudal MD is known to disrupt mnemonic processes in both humans and monkeys, suggesting that this thalamiclimbic prefrontal loop may constitute an important pathway for memory. Key words: thalamus, prefrontal architecture, orbital cortex, limbic system, mediodorsal nucleus, memory, macaque monkeys, medial cortex, cortical lamination, thalamic evolution Classic studies have suggested that the mediodorsal (MD) thalamic nucleus and the prefrontal cortex are closely associated (see Le Gros Clark, '32; Nauta, '71; Reep, '84 for reviews).This view was based on observations that the elaboration of MD is associated with an expansion of the frontal cortex to which it projects (Le Gros Clark, '32; Walker, '36, '38; Von Bonin and Green, '49; Pribram et al., '53; Nauta, '62; Akert, '64; Locke, '69; Tobias, '75; Tanaka, '76). With the advent of new and more sensitive tracing procedures, however, it became apparent that neurons in thalamic nuclei other than MD project to prefrontal areas as well (Carmel, '70; Jones and Leavitt, Accepted July 24, 1991. In this study we used a simple quantitative method to address the issue of diversity in the origin of thalamic projections to prefrontal cortices. This was accomplished by noting the relative proportion of retrogradely labeled neurons in MD compared to those distributed in other thalamic nuclei after injecting retrograde tracers in specific prefrontal areas. In addition, we investigated some hitherto unresolved aspects of the topography of thalamic projections. Therefore, we sought to determine whether the thalamic projections to the same prefrontal cortices varied along these lines.

Both procedures allow accurate topographic presentation of labeled neurons within the thalamus. All sections in one series that contained labeled neurons in the thalamus were charted. Left: Brightfield photomicrographs of coronal sections from rostra1 (A) through caudal (E) sectors of the thalamus showing the location of the various nuclei and their cytoarchitecture. To minimize the above extrinsic factors, we expressed the number of labeled neurons in serial sections through each nucleus as a percentage of the total number of labeled neurons in the entire thalamus in that case. Thalamic borders Architectonic borders of thalamic nuclei were determined from series of matched sections stained with thionin, myelin, AChE, or cytochrome oxidase. This analysis is based on differences in cytoarchitecture and in the pattern of distribution of the histochemical markers among thalamic nuclei (see Fig. RESULTS Architecture of thalamic nuclei The histochemical and cytoarchitectonic procedures used proved to be differentially useful in delineating the borders of the various nuclei. The terminology for the thalamus used in this study is according to the map of Olszewski ('52), with references to modifications described by Jones ('85). Thalamic projections The distribution of labeled neurons in the thalamus after HRP or fluorescent dye injections is shown in diagrams of cross sections in Figures 3-11 and in Table 1. The distribution of labeled neurons within the various thalamic nuclei differed from case to case, as described below. The MD nucleus included the majority of all labeled neurons from the thalamus directed to most prefrontal areas (Table 1).

Relationship of thalamic projections to cortical architecture The present investigation was conducted in the context of our previous architectonic study, where the prefrontal cortex was subdivided in two sectors on the basis of structural and intrinsic connectional criteria (Barbas and Pandya, '89). We now report that the thalamic projections to prefrontal areas also varied along these lines. However, the most striking connectional patterns between the thalamus and the prefrontal cortex were associated with the laminar definition of the prefrontal target areas. For example, areas with a low degree of laminar differentiation received widespread projections involving many thalamic nuclei (Fig. In contrast, cortices with a high degree of laminar definition received projections from fewer thalamic sources (Fig. None of the above thalamic nuclei had significant links with the eulaminate lateral prefrontal areas. The latter (areas 46 and 8) received the majority of their thalamic projections from the parvicellular and multiform sectors of MD (Fig. The association of thalamic origin with the laminar definition of the prefrontal target area extended to the specific topography within one nucleus, or nuclear subdivision, as well. C. Darkfield photomicrograph of a coronal section through the anterior thalamus showing HRP labeled neurons in VAmc (small white arrows) in case 2 with an HRP injection in orbital area 12; the labeled neurons are found in the vicinity of the mamillothalamic tract bounded by two blood vessels dorsally (white circles). The above rostrocaudal relationship in the thalamofrontal projections has not been hitherto described. This finer topographic analysis adds a new dimension to the pattern of thalamofrontal connections and may have implications for the evolution of these thalamic nuclei. Whether the differences in the thalamic input to basoventral and mediodorsal prefrontal cortices have Comparable functional implications is not known. The difficulties in addressing this issue are compounded by the fact that little is known about the physiologic properties of neurons in thalamic nuclei that project to prefrontal cortices. However, several lines of evidence suggest that the thalamic input to prefron- 10969861, 1991, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.903130106 by Rwth Aachen Hochschulbibliothe, Wiley Online Library on [12/09/2023]. Section treated to visualize AChE shows the distribution of this enzyme (dark reaction product) in the anterior (AV and AM), paracentral (Pcn), midline (Clc, large arrow silhouette, reuniens, white arrowhead), and the VAmc nuclei (silhouette arrowhead, in the vicinity of the mamillothalamic tract). For example, neurons in the upper portions of the central lateral and paracentral thalamic nuclei respond to visual stimuli and in association with eye movements (Schlag-Rey and Schlag, '84; Schlag and Schlag-Rey, '84). The above evidence suggests that at least some of the projections from the thalamus to mediodorsal areas may be related to visuomotor functions in a way that the cortical input to these same areas also suggests (Barbas, '88; see also Barbas and Mesulam, '81; Schwartz and Goldman-Rakic, '84; Andersen et al., '85; Huerta et al., '87). Composite diagram summarizing the major projection patterns between the thalamus and prefrontal areas. A-G represent rostra1 to caudal thalamic levels. The physiologic properties of other thalamic nuclei that provide the majority of neurons directed to orbital and medial prefrontal areas are not known. However, the role of sensory input, which may reach limbic thalamic nuclei that target preferentially basal and medial prefrontal cortices, will probably be associated with mnemonic processes as the behavioral data suggest (see Squire and Zola-Morgan, '88 the mediodorsal. Further experiments are necessary to address whether the specific topographic relationships of thalamofrontal projections will have specific behavioral and physiologic attributes as well.

Horseradish peroxidase (HRP) experiments In eight animals, injections of a solution containing 8% HRP conjugated to wheat germ agglutinin (Sigma) were made with a microsyringe (Hamilton, 5 p1) mounted on a microdrive. Small amounts (0.05 ~1) of the injectate were delivered 1.5 mm below the pial surface at each of two adjacent sites separated by 1-2 mm over a 30-minute period. HRP was injected in orbital areas 11 and 12, lateral area 12, and ventral area 46 (cases 1-4). In addition, injections were placed in areas within the mediodorsal prefrontal sector: medial area 32 (case 5), dorsal area 46 (case 71, and dorsal area 8 (cases 8 and 9). Composite of injection sites shown on the medial (A), lateral (B), and basal (C) surfaces of the cerebral hemisphere. The injection sites are superimposed on an architectonic map of the prefrontal cortex (Barbas and Pandya, '89). Fluorescent tracer experiment With the surgical procedures outlined above, one animal received an injection of the fluorescent tracer fast blue (3%, 0.4 pl) in medial area 14 (case 6). Outlines of brain sections, the location of retrogradely labeled neurons ipsilateral to the injection site, and the site of blood vessels used as landmarks were transferred from the slides onto paper by using an X-Y recorder (Hewlett Packard, 7044B), which was electronically coupled to the stage of the microscope. The size of the injection site and histochemical variables inadvertently differ from case to case. Anatomic definition of injection sites The cortical areas containing the injection sites were reconstructed serially using the sulci as landmarks and are shown on diagrams of the surface of the cortex. They are illustrated in diagrams of coronal sections through the injection site in the previous study (Barbas, '88; see Figs. Figure 10F shows the injection site in area 8 in case 8; the boundaries of area 8 are shown in a matched section stained with thionin in Figure 10G. In case 6, not hitherto described, the extent of the injection site of fast blue was plotted from coronal sections, which were then counterstained with cresyl violet and returned to the microscope to determine architectonic borders (see Fig. On the basal and lateral surfaces, the injections were in architectonic areas designated by the same numbers by Walker ('40b); on the medial surface our map corresponds more closely to that of Brodmann ('05). The injections were in four basoventral (area 11, case 1; orbital 12, case 2; lateral 12, case 3; ventral area 46, case 41, and five mediodorsal (area 32, case 5; area 14, case 6; dorsal 46, case 7; dorsal area 8, cases 8-9) prefrontal areas. Eight of the cases appeared in previous studies on cortical projections as described above (see Anatomic definition of injection site). The relationship of the injection sites to architectonic areas of the prefrontal cortex is shown in Figure 1.

We found a nearly identical fibre plexus localized within a distinct nucleus that is cytoarchitectonically homologous to the lamina I relay nucleus in the macaque thalamus. We conclude that this is a specific thalamic nucleus for pain and temperature sensation in both monkey and human. 1 Colour photomicrographs from the thalamus of the macaque monkey (Macaca fascicularis) of: a, dense lamina I STI terminations in VMpo labelled with PHA-L (Phaseolus vulgaris leukoagglutinin) and Texas red; b, topographically distributed trigeminal (orange) and cervical (green) lamina I terminations in VMpo labelled with fluorescent dextrans (only the anterior aspect ofthe cervical labelling is visible, because it is an anteroposterior topography); c, lesions (arrows) delimiting VMpo (the region of darker neurons) between which recordings of nociceptive and thermoreceptive neurons were obtained; and, d, PHA-LIabelled lamina I terminations (orange) within the calbindin-positive fibre plexus (green) of VMpo. Single-unit (and cluster) recordings were made under barbiturate anaesthesia as described in previous studies of other nociceptive and thermoreceptive neurons7 "" 23' 24 Calbindin 770 Because the sensations of pain and temperature are unequivocally associated with the spinothalamic tract (STT), understanding their neural mechanisms requires the identification of the thalamic terminations of the nociceptive and thermoreceptive components of the STT. We first examined STT terminations in the thalamus of macaque monkeys in which restricted injections7 of high-resolution anterograde tracers had been made into lamina I. These findings in the macaque monkey indicate that VMpo is a specific thalamic relay nucleus for nociception and thermoimmunoreactivity was demonstrated with FITC using double-labelling methods25 A monoclonal anti-calbindin (Sigma) was used that produces a slightly different labelling pattern from that reported by others26. 3 Photomicrographic pairs from adjacent sections showing the cytoarchitectonic identification of VMpo with the dense calbindin-positive fibre plexus (matching open arrows) in the right posterior thalamus of the macaque monkey (top) and the human (middle) in similar planes of section (monkey, frontal; human, oblique transverse). The thalamus from normal human autopsy brains was immersion-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 3 weeks and then serial, 50-llm frozen sections were cut in either the stereotaxic frontal (n = 3), horizontal (n = 1) or sagittal (n = 3) plane, or in an oblique plane midway between frontal and transverse to the brainstem (n = 2). Further, the location of VMpo in monkeys is consistent with the general region in humans in which infarcts can produce analgesia and thermanaesthesiai 10, in which stimulation can evoke painful or thermal sensations2 3 , and in which a few nociceptive neurons have been recorded II_ As a distinct nucleus has not been identified in this region in the human thalamus, we sought an immunohistochemical marker that could be used to identify VMpo across primates. Although other calbindinpositive regions were observed in the thalamus, these were differentiated from VMpo by intervening unlabelled zones, weaker staining with a different appearance, or the presence of many calbindin-positive cells.

We found a dense calbindin-positive fibre plexus in the human posterior thalamus that is unmistakably similar to that found in VMpo in the macaque monkey (Fig. Significantly, the average stereotaxic coordinates (extending from about A -0.5 to + 2.0, L 12.0 to 16.0 and H -1.0 to + 1.0) of the human VMpo and its position just posteroinferior to the main somatosensory thalamus fit the clinical descriptions of the region in which stimulation evokes pain or cold in humans2 "" 3 . Thus, our observations identify VMpo as a homologous thalamic nucleus in humans and macaque monkeys that relays specific pain and temperature activity. The existence of this nucleus and its apparent cortical projection to the insula provide direct evidence supporting the specific nature of human pain and temperature sensibility and their functional association with the limbic system17 18 These findings demonstrate the structural basis for the strong activation of the posterior thalamus and the insula in positron emission tomography (PET) studies of human pain sensibility19 21 . Finally, the identification of VMpo explains the analgesia and thermanaesthesia observed in patients with thalamic pain syndrome, which is associated with lesions in this region of thalamus 1 22 .","In order to demonstrate topography, simultaneous iontophoretic lamina I injections were made at trigeminal and cervical levels, or at cervical and lumbar levels, with c FITC- and TRITC-Iabelled M, 10K lysine-fixable dextrans, which can be examined without processing.

POWELL (From the Department of Human Anatomy, Oxford) INTRODUCTION RELATIVELY few attempts have been made to study thalamocortical connexions with techniques for demonstrating antegrade axonal degeneration (Nauta and Whitlock, 1954). This omission is largely due to the inherent difficulty involved in placing stereotaxic lesions in single thalamic nuclei without directly damaging the cortex or interrupting fibres leaving other thalamic nuclei within the thalamus itself. It is necessary to make further investigations of this type for the classical method of studying thalamocortical relationsthat of retrograde cellular degeneration (Le Gros Clark and Boggon, 1935; Walker, 1938)in being relatively insensitive and difficult to interpret (Powell and Cowan, 1967) cannot give more than a general indication of the cortical fields to which a thalamic nucleus projects. This study has now been extended to the monkey because it is not known whether the ventroposterior nucleus of the monkey projects to SLI and also because there is some evidence that the architectonic (and functional) subdivisions of SI, areas 3, 1 and 2, receive differential connexions from the thalamus (Le Gros Clark and Powell, 1953; Roberts and Akert, 1963). Another aspect of the present study concerns the reciprocal, corticothalamic, pathway. This has been extensively studied in the cat (Auer, 1956; Niimi et ah, 1963; Kusama, Otani and Kawana, 1966; Rinvik, 1968a, b; Jones and Powell, 1968), and it has been shown that both SI and SLI send fibres to the ventroposterior nucleus and to the posterior group of thalamic nuclei. It was hoped, therefore, that the simian homologue of the posterior group might be defined on the basis of its corticothalamic connexions. These may be divided into two groups: (a) in six experiments electrolytic lesions were placed in the ventroposterior nucleus of the thalamus by means of an approximately horizontally orientated electrode, introduced stereotaxically from behind and passing through the ipsilateral visual cortex; (b) the remaining series, many of which have been used in other investigations (Jones and Powell, 1969c, d) have lesions in the cerebral cortex. Most of the remainder are in the somatic sensory cortex and have been used to describe the corticothalamic connexions of SI and SFJ. In three of the experiments in which lesions had been placed in the thalamus, the somatic sensory cortex and thalamus were sectioned coronally, in two the cortex and thalamus were cut horizontally and in the sixth the cortex above the level of the rostral end of the intraparietal sulcus was cut sagitally and the remainder of the brain horizontally. For descriptive purposes the terminology of Olszewski (1952) will be used when referring to the nuclei of the thalamus, except that no distinction will be drawn between the nucleus ventralis posterolateralis pars caudalis and the nucleus ventralis posterolateralis, pars oralis: these will be referred to collectively as the nucleus ventralis posterolateralis (VPL). RESULTS Thalamocortical pathway.As all the lesions in the thalamus were made by a similar approach, a general account of the course of the electrode track will be given to avoid repetition. It is important to note that in all cases only the visual cortex is damaged or undercut and in the thalamus, apart from the ventroposterior nucleus, only the pulvinar has been penetrated by the electrode. In all the brains which have been cut horizontally or sagittally, the degenerating thalamocortical fibres display a constant arrangement within the white matter of the postcentral gyrus. by guest on May 11, 2016 http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from SOMATIC SENSORY CORTEX 41 serve to indicate the organization present within the thalamocortical projection. To test this possibility, in two cases very large lesions designed to destroy most of VPL were made in the thalamus. Experiment TL6 will be described as the one least complicated by direct invdlvement of other thalamic nuclei. by guest on May 11, 2016 http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from 44 E. G. JONES AND T. P. S. POWELL The corticothalamic pathway.Small lesions confined to single topographic subdivisions of the first somatic sensory cortex cause restricted foci of axonal degeneration in the ventroposterior nucleus and in the reticular nucleus, and give rise to further degeneration in a small region at the caudal pole of the thalamus which it is possible to equate with the posterior nuclear group of the cat. In the white matter they appear as a broad bundle and descend almost vertically towards the thalamus. Within the ventroposterior nucleus these degenerating corticothalamic fibres are very fine and appear to break up almost immediately into pericellular ramifications (fig. Scattered fine fragments in the reticular nucleus, chiefly among the degenerating fibres passing through it to VPL indicate that some corticothalamic fibres terminate in this nucleus. The only other parts of the thalamus containing axonal degeneration are the caudal end of the nucleus centralis lateralis, the adjoining by guest on May 11, 2016 http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from SOMATIC SENSORY CORTEX 45 posterodorsal part of the centre median nucleus and a small region immediately caudal to the ventroposterior nucleus, overhung by the nucleus pulvinaris oralis and lying dorsomedial to the medial lemniscus and magnocellular division of the medial geniculate body (fig. It appears to occupy the region shown by Mehler, Feferman and Nauta (1960) to receive ascending fibres from the spinal cord and considered by Mehler (1966) to be the simian homologue of the posterior thalamic nuclear group of the cat. Such a distribution would appear to involve the parts of VPM related to the perioral regions (Mountcastle and Henneman, 1952) and also the thalamic relay for taste afferents (Blomquist, Benjamin and Emmers, 1962). No degeneration appears in VPL The second somatic sensory area, SII, sends fibres to the same parts of the thalamus as SI. Degenerating corticothalamic fibres leaving this lesion distribute fine pericellular degeneration to most of VPM, though not to the parvocellular part, and to adjoining parts of VPL. At the caudal pole of the thalamus the same restricted region which contains degeneration after lesions in SI also shows fine degenerating fragments. Fine degeneration in the thalamus fills the nucleus lateralis posterior and a few fragments may encroach upon the dorsal part of the nucleus pulvinaris oralis, but there are none in the ventroposterior nucleus. Of special interest is an additional focus of degeneration at the caudal end of the thalamus which lies immediately dorsomedial to and slightly overlapping that described in the experiments with lesions of SI and SII. Corticothalamic fibres returning from SI and SII are distributed to the ventroposterior nucleus in a similarly organized manner, and also pass to the reticular nucleus and to a restricted region at the caudal pole of the thalamus which may be equated with the ""posterior group"" of the cat. In the cat, areas 3, 1 and 2 seem to receive equal projections from the ventroposterior nucleus, and there was little indication that thalamocortical fibres entering the three subareas differed greatly in size. That the less dense projection to areas 1 and 2 is not merely a function of the small size of the lesions is shown by the fact that it does not increase despite damage to very large parts of VPL, with inevitable interruption of fibres from other thalamic nuclei. A final analysis must, however, await detailed electrophysiological studies of the cortical projections of single thalamic neurons using the method of antidromic stimulation. The thalamocortical fibres passing to area 3a are as thick as those directed to area 3, but in experiments with small restricted lesions of the ventroposterior nucleus the by guest on May 11, 2016 http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/ Downloaded from SOMATIC SENSORY CORTEX 49 terminal degeneration in area 3a is far less intense. When, howe\er, large lesions, which though confined to VPL, must inevitably interrupt thalamocortical fibres from VP pars oralis, VL and VPI and probably from other nuclei as well, the terminal degeneration in area 3a becomes intense. The increase in the projection to area 3a demonstrated by experiments with large lesions which do not cause marked increases in the projections to areas 3, 1 and 2 would suggest that either a specific part of VPL or, alternatively, some other thalamic nucleus, is the main relay for area 3a. If area 3a is a cortical receiving area for Group I afferents from skeletal muscle (Oscarrson and Rosen, 1966; Landgren and Silfvenius, 1968; Jones and Powell, 1969c), then the anterior part of VPL would seem a likely possibility, as in the cat, at least, this region is the thalamic relay for such afferents (Andersson, Landgren and Wolsk, 1966). Because of the inevitability of interrupting fibres of passage it seems unlikely that the detailed dermatomal relationships of the somatic sensory cortex and thalamus can ever be satisfactorily established by anatomical means. Moreover, the parvocellular part of VPM is known to be the thalamic relay for taste afferents {see Oakley and Benjamin, 1966) and from comparison with the squirrel monkey (Benjamin and Burton, 1968; Benjamin, Emmers and Blomquist, 1968) the cortical area under consideration would appear to contain the projection areas for taste. The ventroposterior nucleus of the monkey, cat and several other animals (Mountcastle and Henneman, 1952; Rose and Mountcastle, 1952, 1954) has been divided into a large ventrobasal complex consisting of VPL and VPM proper, which is coextensive with the thalamic region excited by cutaneous stimulation, and a VPI and a ventromedial complex (the latter mainly consisting of the parvocellular part of VPM) which are not. The corticothalamic pathway.In the present study no attempt was made to differentiate between orthograde degeneration of corticothalamic fibres and possible retrograde degeneration of thalamocortical fibres. The existence of corticothalamic fibres passing to the three main sensory relay nuclei of the thalamus has been confirmed electron microscopically (Szentagothai, Hamori and Tombol, 1966; Jones and Powell, 1969a), and there is little reason to believe that such fibres should be absent in the monkey. It is possible that the degeneration in the thalamus of some of the brains used in this investigation is a combination of both orthograde and retrograde axonal break-up, but at least some probably belong in the former category. This is not unexpected, for as pointed out above, this has been shown to be the thalamic relay for taste afferents and the taste projection areas in Macaca mulatto should be in these rostral parts of areas 3, 1 and 2. Probably one of the more interesting aspects of the findings on the corticothalamic projection is the demonstration of additional projections from SI and SIT, and also from area 5, to a small region at the caudal pole of the thalamus which may be equated with the posterior group of the cat. SUMMARY The thalamic connexionsascending and descendingof the somatic sensory cortex have been examined in Macaca mulatto by means of the Nauta technique. The projection to area 3a is composed of thick fibres but terminal degeneration in it is sparse except when very large thalamic lesions are used. The thalamocortical projection is reciprocated by returning corticothalamic fibres which pass from SI and SIT in an organized manner to the ventroposterior nucleus. Of special interest is a projection from SI and SII and area 5 to a region at the caudal pole of the thalamus which includes the suprageniculate nucleus, nucleus limitans and parts of the magnocellular medial geniculate nucleus (Olszewski's, 1952, terminology). This appears to be the simian homologue of the posterior group of the thalamic nuclei of the cat, and the part receiving fibres from the somatic sensory cortex has been shown (Mehler, 1966) to receive ascending fibres from the spinal cord and dorsal column nuclei. o.

In this study, we describe the thalamocortical connections of the parabelt auditory cortex based on multiple injections of neuronal tracers into this region in each of five macaque monkeys. MATERIALS AND METHODS In five macaque monkeys (three M. mulatta, three M. nemestrina), microinjections of four to seven anatomical tracers were made at equal intervals along the dorsal superior temporal gyrus within 3 mm of the lateral sulcus in the left hemisphere.

DISCUSSION In previous papers (Hackett et al., 1998; Kaas and Hackett, 1998), we proposed that the auditory cortex in macaque monkeys includes three major regions occupying much of the superior temporal plane and dorsal superior temporal gyrus.

The rostrocaudal topography of the parabelt region was maintained in the thalamocortical connections, supporting the parcellation of this region of cortex. 400:271286, 1998. r 1998 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Indexing terms: association cortex; thalamus; medial geniculate; pulvinar Our studies of auditory cortex in monkeys, in conjunction with those from other laboratories, have led us to propose three levels of auditory processing in the temporal lobe (Hackett et al., 1998; Kaas and Hackett, 1998). The question we address here is: what are the thalamic inputs to the parabelt? By placing injections of different distinguishable tracers in rows along the rostrocaudal extent of the parabelt region, we could determine whether the parabelt region, defined as auditory by inputs from the belt, also receives auditory inputs from the thalamus. We could also determine whether the parabelt cortex receives other significant thalamic inputs, such as from the medial Grant sponsor: NINDS; Grant number: NS 16446; Grant sponsor: NIDCD Research Fellowship; Grant number: DC 00249. The results would also indicate whether thalamic structures project to parabelt cortex in topographic patterns, whether the complete parabelt region shares inputs from any specific thalamic nuclei, and whether parts of the parabelt region differ in thalamic inputs. To facilitate the interpretation of results, it was important to identify thalamic nuclei effectively in the experimental cases. Thus, we used several histological and histochemical procedures to help define thalamic nuclei. In particular, some sections were processed for calbindin and parvalbumin, in part because the distribution of these proteins can be quite variable among different thalamic nuclei (Jones and Hendry, 1989; Molinari et al., 1995). The thalamus was separated from the brain, soaked in 30% sucrose solution overnight, and then cut in the frontal plane at 40 m on a freezing microtome. RESULTS Thalamic architecture and subdivisions The architecture and subdivisions of the posterior thalamus were studied by comparing adjacent tissue sections stained for Nissl, acetylcholinesterase, cytochrome oxidase, calbindin, and parvalbumin. Figure 1 contains a series of frontal sections through the posterior thalamus where labeled cells were found. The border between the transition zone and the ventral and magnocellular nuclei was generally more distinct than the border with the dorsal nucleus; therefore, this border was represented as a dashed line in reconstructions depicting the thalamocortical connections (see Figs. AJ: Coronal sections of the macaque monkey thalamus (case 961) at the level of the medial geniculate complex and medial pulvinar. Thalamic connections of the parabelt auditory cortex The thalamocortical connections of the parabelt auditory cortex were determined by injecting retrograde tracers into the superior temporal gyrus near the ventral lip of the lateral sulcus (Fig. The locations of labeled cells in the thalamus were plotted on drawings of adjacent sections showing architectonic boundaries and subdivisions. In the thalamus, these injections resulted in substantial cell labeling in the MGv (Fig. Reconstructions of coronal sections of the thalamus (case 9464) showing distribution of labeled cells after tracer injections into the parabelt cortex.

Reconstructions of coronal sections of the thalamus (case 9552) showing distribution of labeled cells after tracer injections into the parabelt cortex. In summary, the thalamocortical connections of the parabelt auditory cortex included the dorsal and magnocellular nuclei of the medial geniculate complex (i.e., MGd, MGm), suprageniculate, limitans, and medial pulvinar nuclei. In the present study the thalamocortical connections of the parabelt region were examined by placing injections of several retrograde tracers into the dorsal half of the STG within 35 mm of the lateral sulcus. Projections to the parabelt region from the thalamus originated principally from the medial geniculate complex, suprageniculate, limitans, and medial pulvinar nuclei (Fig. See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License portions of these thalamic nuclei. Although the thalamocortical connections of the parabelt region have not been systematically studied previously, tracer injections in the superior temporal gyrus have not revealed significant connections with the MGv (Pandya et al., 1994). Likewise, when lesions or injections of the thalamus are restricted to the MGv, degenerated terminals or labeled cells are limited to the areas in and around the core on the superior temporal plane (Pandya and Sanides, 1973; Mesulam and Pandya, 1973; Burton and Jones, 1976; Hashikawa et al., 1995). Two previous studies suggested that the thalamocortical connections of the MGv are restricted to the core (Burton and Jones, 1976; Molinari et al., 1995). The reasons for this discrepancy are unclear, but they may be related to differences in methodology or criteria in determining the borders between areas in the cortex and thalamus. Schematic summarizing the major thalamic connections of the auditory cortex. Bottom row, thalamic nuclei, which project to the auditory cortex. Overall, these findings indicate that Tpt can be distinguished from the parabelt on the basis of its thalamic and cortical connections (Hackett et al., 1998), and they suggest that Tpt is less directly involved in auditory processing, although it is certainly influenced by inputs from the auditory parabelt cortex. The pattern of thalamocortical projections observed in the present study reflects this topography. A similar pattern has also been observed in the thalamocortical connections of the lateral belt region (Burton and Jones, 1976; Morel and Kaas, 1992; Molinari et al., 1995). Existing descriptions of cortical connections with the Sg/Lim vary widely, but they consistently associate this region of the thalamus with the auditory system. Lesions of the posterior thalamus involving the Sg resulted in degeneration in the temporal operculum that could not be attributed specifically to the Sg (Mesulam and Pandya, 1973). (1994) noted corticothalamic projections to the Sg/Lim from the core, medial belt, lateral belt, and STG. Medial pulvinar The medial pulvinar (PM) is situated dorsomedially in the thalamus forming much of the posterodorsal surface of the pulvinar (Jones, 1985). (1992) reported thalamic connections to the parieto-insular vestibular cortex from the PM. That is, the thalamocortical connection patterns reviewed here suggest that functionally distinct groups of cells are segregated in the lateral (visual) and medial (auditory) PM, with more overlap in the central third of the nucleus.

Only when injections encroached on the lateral belt cortex were substantial numbers of labeled neurons found in the ventral (MGv) division of the MGC, consistent with the absence of significant connections between the parabelt and core fields. By placing injections of different distinguishable tracers in rows along the rostrocaudal extent of the parabelt region, we could determine whether the parabelt region, defined as auditory by inputs from the belt, also receives auditory inputs from the thalamus. MATERIALS AND METHODS In five macaque monkeys (three M. mulatta, three M. nemestrina), microinjections of four to seven anatomical tracers were made at equal intervals along the dorsal superior temporal gyrus within 3 mm of the lateral sulcus in the left hemisphere. The procedures for making tracer injections and evaluating their locations have been described in detail in our previous paper on cortical connections based on the same cases (Hackett et al., 1998). The postinjection survival period was 7 days when WGA-HRP was used (three cases) and 12 days when only fluorescent tracers were injected (two cases). The final drawings were analyzed to reveal: 1) the individual connection patterns of each tracer injection; 2) the connection patAbbreviations AD anterodorsal medial geniculate nucleus AI auditory area I (core) AS arcuate sulcus BrCs brachium of the superior colliculus CiS circular sulcus CP caudal parabelt area (CP) CS central sulcus DY Diamidino Yellow FB Fast Blue FR Fluoro-Ruby GB rhodamine green beads Hb habenular nucleus HbL lateral habenular nucleus HbM medial habenular nucleus HRP horseradish peroxidase ILS inferior limiting sulcus IPS intraparietal sulcus Lim limitans nucleus LS lateral sulcus LuS lunate sulcus M magnocellular medial geniculate nucleus MD mediodorsal nucleus MGC medial geniculate complex MGd dorsal medial geniculate complex MGad anterodorsal medial geniculate nucleus MGm magnocellular medial geniculate nucleus MGpd posterodorsal medial geniculate nucleus MGv ventral medial geniculate nucleus PA anterior pulvinar nucleus PD posterodorsal medial geniculate nucleus PI inferior pulvinar nucleus PL lateral pulvinar nucleus PM medial pulvinar nucleus PP peripeduncular nucleus Po posterior nucleus PS principal sulcus R rostral area (core) RB rhodamine red beads RP rostral parabelt area (parabelt) RT rostrotemporal area (core) Sg suprageniculate nucleus STG superior temporal gyrus STS superior temporal sulcus Tpt temporal parietotemporal area WGA wheat germ agglutinin V ventral medial geniculate nucleus Z zone of transition 272 T.A.

This cell was typical of the large cells found in the lateral and central PM, which were not labeled by our parabelt injections. The large cells in the medial PM were frequently labeled by injections of the parabelt. Thalamic connections of the parabelt auditory cortex The thalamocortical connections of the parabelt auditory cortex were determined by injecting retrograde tracers into the superior temporal gyrus near the ventral lip of the lateral sulcus (Fig. Cell labeling in the MGv was nearly absent when tracer injections were limited to the parabelt and did not involve the cortex of the lateral belt on the superior temporal plane. In case 9552 the FB (open triangles), WGA-HRP (filled squares), and DY (open squares) injections involved both the parabelt and the lateral belt adjacent to AI (Fig. In the thalamus, these injections resulted in substantial cell labeling in the MGv (Fig. In the same case labeled cells associated with these three injections were also found dorsal to the MGd in a region corresponding in location to the posterior nucleus (Po). Connections of the dorsal medial geniculate nuclei (MGpd and MGad) exhibited a rostrocaudal topography with the parabelt, that is, rostral injections of the STG tended to label cells posteriorly and caudal injections labeled cells anteriorly in the MGd. 6), restriction of the parabelt injections to the rostral half of the STG resulted in topographic labeling in the posterior MGd, corresponding to MGpd, whereas the MGad was virtually devoid of labeled cells. The large cells in the central PM were not labeled by parabelt injections and were larger than those in the medial PM, which were sometimes labeled by parabelt injections. 4, sections 111 and 121) labeled cells were distributed in patches that were often segregated from cells labeled by other injections. Furthermore, as in case 9464 section 111, labeled cells associated with the same injection were sometimes segregated into groups. In the rostral third of the MGm, fewer numbers of labeled cells were found, and these were usually associated with the most caudal injection sites. The patches of labeled cells sometimes reflected the rostrocaudal sequence of injections in the cortex, but more often the patches contained labeled cells associated with the same injection, indicating that separate zones in the MGm project in parallel to the same location in cortex. 4), cells labeled by rostral and caudal parabelt injections overlapped in sections 111 and 121 with little evidence of segregation. In case 961, cells labeled by the most rostral and most caudal injections overlapped in the most posterior section analyzed (Fig. In case 9552, the distribution of labeled cells appeared to be slightly more patchy than in the other cases, and even cells labeled by closely spaced injections were segregated (Fig. Note that the three most caudal injections in this case also involved the cortex of the lateral belt, but it is unclear whether this contributed significantly to the greater segregation. In case 9464, only one labeled cell was found in the MGm that was associated with the Fast Blue injection (Fig. This injection, made in area Tpt (Pandya and Sanides, 1973) caudal to the parabelt, was the most caudal injection made in the five cases analyzed for this study and labeled many cells in the PM, PL, and Sg/Lim. The distribution of cells in the cortex labeled by this injection was also unique, virtually circumscribing the caudal belt areas (Hackett et al., 1998). It was common to find cells in the MGm that were double-labeled by closely spaced injections. Figure 8 shows a cell in the MGm (case 961) double labeled by injections of FR (Fig. The injections were placed about 4 mm apart in the parabelt lateral to R (Fig. 4), numerous cells labeled by the rostral DY injection (filled circles) were found in posterior sections containing the Sg/Lim (sections 111, 121, and 131). Anteriorly, a mixed population of cells labeled by rostral and caudal injection sites was found, but the number of cells labeled by the rostral injection was reduced (e.g., section 141). 5), in which only labeled cells associated with the most caudal injections were found in the anterior Sg/Lim. 6) very few cells in the Lim were labeled by the three most rostral injection sites (filled symbols), and apparently none in the Sg. This contrasts sharply with the relatively dense cell labeling in the PM and MGC associated with these injections. In contrast, the number of labeled cells in the Sg/Lim was much greater for the other, more caudal, injections in this case (open symbols). These injections were positioned lateral to the rostral subdivision (R) of the auditory core, whereas the three rostral injections were placed beyond the rostral border of R. In case 9552 (Fig. In posterior sections, labeled cells from only the most rostral parabelt injections occupied the extreme ventromedial portion of the medial Fig. Dorsorostral view of the left macaque superior temporal region showing the major regions of the auditory cortex (core, medial/ lateral belt, parabelt) and locations of injection sites for each case.

In more anterior sections the distribution of labeled cells spread dorsally and laterally, involving cells labeled by the more caudal parabelt injections. Labeled cells associated with widely spaced injection sites along the rostrocaudal axis of the parabelt tended to remain segregated in the medial pulvinar, whereas closely spaced injection sites resulted in overlapping distributions. Typically, cells labeled by caudal injection sites occupied positions dorsal and lateral to cells labeled by rostral injections. 6) labeled cells associated with the most rostral injection (FB, filled circles) were clearly segregated from cells associated with the three most caudal injections in PM. The DY (open squares) and FR (open triangles) injection sites, which were particularly close together, yielded very similar distributions of labeled cells, some of which were labeled by both tracers (i.e., double-labeled). In contrast, double-labeled cells associated with more widely spaced injection sites were not observed in PM. The overlapping distribution of cells often observed in the central PM tended to be associated with injections in the caudal parabelt, whereas rostral parabelt injections labeled cells nearer the medial and dorsal edge of the PM. In many sections, large scattered cells labeled by the most rostral injection sites were found along the extreme dorsomedial edge of PM, coextensive with the narrow band of intense calbindin immunoreactivity described above (e.g., Fig. Cells labeled by more caudal injections occupied relatively ventral and lateral positions in medial PM. Projections from the ventral nucleus (MGv) were only observed when the cortex of the lateral belt was involved in the injection; thus, the MGv does not appear to be significantly connected with the parabelt. In the present study the thalamocortical connections of the parabelt region were examined by placing injections of several retrograde tracers into the dorsal half of the STG within 35 mm of the lateral sulcus. A topographic pattern of connections was reflected in these projections such that rostral parabelt injections labeled more caudal Fig. Projections from the MGv were observed only when the cortex of the lateral belt was involved in the tracer injection. The involvement of the belt cortex by the injection was associated with the appearance of labeled cells in the auditory core, which is unlabeled after injections restricted to the parabelt (Hackett et al., 1998). Although the thalamocortical connections of the parabelt region have not been systematically studied previously, tracer injections in the superior temporal gyrus have not revealed significant connections with the MGv (Pandya et al., 1994). Only when these injections appeared to encroach on the lateral belt or core were labeled cells found in the MGv (Fitzpatrick and Imig, 1978; Morel and Kaas, 1992; Morel et al., 1993; Molinari et al., 1995; Kosmal et al., 1997). Likewise, when lesions or injections of the thalamus are restricted to the MGv, degenerated terminals or labeled cells are limited to the areas in and around the core on the superior temporal plane (Pandya and Sanides, 1973; Mesulam and Pandya, 1973; Burton and Jones, 1976; Hashikawa et al., 1995). In our material labeled cells were found in the MGm after all parabelt injections. For example, rostral parabelt injections tended to label the caudal MGm and vice versa, but distributions of labeled cells from the rostral and caudal parabelt sometimes overlapped in patches, usually midway between the rostral and caudal thirds of the nucleus. Conversely, even labeled cells associated with adjacent injections were segregated in patches, usually in the dorsoventral dimension. Based on the sizes and depths of our injections, it is likely that both populations of cells were labeled in the MGm, possibly accounting for the complex pattern of connections. An additional observation gleaned from the present study was that numerous labeled cells were found in the MGm after all parabelt injections, but not after a single injection in Tpt (open squares, case 9464), which labeled cells in the Sg/Lim and pulvinar. For example, after a large isotope injection in Tpt, possibly limited to the exposed surface of the STG, labeled terminals were found in the pulvinar, suprageniculate, and MGd, but not the MGm or MGv (Pandya et al., 1994). However, when the adjacent area paAc, just medial to Tpt on the superior temporal plane, was involved by injections of Tpt in other cases, labeled terminals were then found in the MGm. Furthermore, injections in the areas immediately rostral to Tpt, corresponding to the parabelt region (i.e., paAlt, Ts3) always labeled terminals in the MGm. Injections of the rostral parabelt labeled cells posteriorly, in the MGpd, whereas injections of the caudal parabelt labeled cells anteriorly, primarily in the MGad. Thus, injections in the parabelt caudal to lateral extension of the AI/R border tend to label cells in the caudal belt and caudal parabelt, whereas STG injections rostral to the border of AI and R tend to label cells in the rostral belt and parabelt (Hackett et al., 1998). (1995), injections of retrograde tracers were made in the rostral and caudal portions of the lateral belt region. Although no injections were placed in the medial belt, it was clear that the MGad projected more strongly to the lateral auditory belt caudal to the border of AI and R, whereas the MGpd projected to the lateral belt cortex rostral to that border. In our material, most of the injections into the parabelt labeled cells in the Sg/Lim. Burton and Jones (1976) found topographically organized labeling in the granular insula following isotope injections restricted to the Sg and Sg/Lim complex in rhesus and squirrel monkeys. In their material, label was found in the lateral sulcus and caudal STG only when an injection involved the MGC. (1989) found anterograde and retrograde labeling associated with injections of WGA-HRP into AI, as well as cells labeled retrogradely by fluorescent tracers. In owl monkeys, injections of tracers into AI and R of the core produced retrogradely labeled cells in the Sg (Fitzpatrick and Imig, 1978; Morel and Kaas, 1992), although injections restricted to R were associated with much sparser labeling, compared with AI. Morel and Kaas (1992) also found labeled cells in the owl monkey Sg associated with injections into the lateral belt and rostral superior temporal gyrus. (1993) in M. fascicularis, although labeling in the Sg appeared to be heavier following injection of the lateral belt compared with AI. (1995), except that they made no injections into the STG. In rats, Kurokawa and Saito (1995) found that a population of smaller neurons in the Sg projected to premotor frontal cortex, whereas the overlapping population of larger cells was retrogradely labeled by injections in the auditory association cortex of the temporal lobe (i.e., Te3). Following parabelt injections, cell labeling in the PM tended to overlap with regions of darker immunoreactivity for calbindin. Rostral injections in the auditory parabelt tended to label cells along the medial edge of the PM, whereas more caudal injections revealed connections dorsally and laterally, but typically not more lateral than the central third of the nucleus; thus the projections to the parabelt originated in the medial and central PM, but not the lateral PM. In their material rostral injections into the dorsal bank of the STS labeled cells in the medial PM (cases 1 and 2), whereas more caudally placed injections in the dorsal bank of the STS resulted in labeling in the central/lateral PM, as well as PL (cases 38).",,,

The results showed that each of these areas receives afferents from a set of thalamic nuclei and that this set differs, qualitatively and quantitatively, according to the injected area. o 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Indexing terms: thalamocortical projections, premotor cortex, supplementary motor area, primates Considerable evidence has been provided in recent years to support the notion that, in the monkey, the rostra1 part of the agranular frontal cortex (area 6 of Brodmann, 1909) is formed by a mosaic of different anatomical and functional areas (Matelli et al., 1985; Wise et al., 1991; Matelli and Luppino, 1992; He et al., 1993, 1995). The aim of the present study is to define the thalamic nuclei that send projections to each of the mesial and superior area 6 areas and to quantify these projections. Although there are several reports in the literature concerning the thalamic input to superior or mesial area 6, in most of them, no systematic attempt was made to correlate the location of the injection sites with anatomically or physiologically well-defined areas (Kievit and Kuypers, 1977; Miyata and Sasaki, 1983, 1984; Schell and Strick, 1984; GoldmanRakic and Porrino, 1985; Ilinsky et al., 1985; Wiesendanger and Wiesendanger, 1985a; Darian-Smith et al., 1990; Nakano et al., 1993; Inase and Tanji, 1994). In addition, in the few studies in which the physiological properties of the injected areas (SEF: Huerta and Kaas, 1990; Shook et al., 1991; SMA-proper: Tokuno et al., 1992; Rouiller et al., 1994; Shindo et al., 1995; superior area 6: Kurata, 1994) were assessed, the quantitative contribution of each thalamic nucleus was not reported. This kind of information becomes particularly important if one considers that, in the motor thalamus, the pallidal and the cerebellar outflows reach separate nuclei, and each of these two main corticosubcortical loops appears to be composed of several parallel subcircuits whose thalamic relay is relatively segregated (Kuo and Carpenter, 1973; Carpenter et al., 1976; Kim et al., 1976; De Vito and Anderson, 1982; Asanuma et al., 1983a,b; Alexander et al., 1986; Ilinsky and Kultas-Ilinsky, 1987; Ilinsky et al., 1993; Percheron et al., 1993; Rouiller et al., 1994). Previous data have shown that mesial area 6 is dominated by thalamic afferents from the ventral lateral nucleus pars oralis (VLo) and that area 6, therefore, is under the influence of the basal ganglia outflow (Schell and Strick, 1984). (1990), who showed that the thalamic input to mesial area 6 originates in several thalamic nuclei, AD AM AV Caud Cdc Cif c1 Clc Cn.Md Com.Post Csl For Hlpc Hm LD Li LP MD Pcn Pf Pu1.m Pul.0 anterior dorsal nucleus anterior medial nucleus anterior ventral nucleus caudate nucleus central densocellular nucleus central inferior nucleus central lateral nucleus central latocellular nucleus centromedian nucleus posterior commissure central superior lateral nucleus fornix lateral habenular nucleus, pars parvocellularis medial habenular nucleus lateral dorsal nucleus limitans nucleus lateral posterior nucleus medial dorsal nucleus paracentral nucleus parafascicular nucleus medial pulvinar nucleus oral pulvinar nucleus Abbreviations R Re SG Sub.Th THI TMT VA VAmc VApc VLC VLm VLO VPI WLC WLOIVLC complex WLO WM VPMpc X z1 reticular nucleus reuniens nucleus suprageniculate nucleus subthalamic nucleus habenulointerpeduncular tract mammillothalamic tract ventral anterior nucleus ventral anterior nucleus, pars magnocellularis ventral anterior nucleus, pars parvocellularis ventral lateral nucleus, pars caudalis ventral lateral nucleus, pars medialis ventral lateral nucleus pars oralis ventral posterior inferior nucleus nucleus ventralis posterior lateralis, pars caudalis caudal parts of VPLo and VLc nucleus ventralis posterior lateralis, pars oralis ventral posterior medial nucleus ventral posterior medial nucleus, pars parvocellularis area X zona incerta 10969861, 1996, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1096-9861(19960812)372:1<59::AID-CNE6>3.0.CO;2-L by Rwth Aachen Hochschulbibliothe, Wiley Online Library on [12/09/2023]. In particular, the study by Wiesendanger and Wiesendanger (1985a) reported that the thalamic connectivity of the classical SMA is not homogeneous but that there is a gradual shift in the labeled thalamic nuclei moving from the caudal part to the rostral part of mesial area 6. (1995), and the origin of the thalamic input to this area was described, but no quantitative data were provided. In addition, the number and percentage of retrogradely labeled cells in each thalamic nucleus were determined in order to assess the exact contribution of each nucleus to the injected area. The data showed that each area of mesial and superior area 6 is connected with a set of thalamic nuclei in which both cerebellar and basal ganglia recipient nuclei are represented with substantial contributions. In this respect, the general patterns of thalamic connectivity of these two area 6 sectors were found to be similar to those of the two inferior area 6 areas (F4 and F5) that were observed in a previous study (Matelli et al., 1989). In all animals retrograde transport of neuronal tracers injected into the cortex was used to define the origin of thalamic input to mesial and superior area 6. The location of each labeled thalamic neuron was plotted in each section every 300 p,m with the aid of an XIY plotter connected to inductive displacement transducers that were mounted on the microscope stage. The borders of the thalamic nuclei were defined in the adjacent Nissl-stained sections and were superimposed on the plots of the WGA-HRP or fluorescent labeling with the aid of a microprojector. The photomicrographs in Figure 2 show some typical WGA-HRP or fluorescent tracer labeling in various thalamic nuclei. In all cases and for all tracer injections, the thalamic labeling was quantified by counting all of the marked neurons in each plotted section and by determining the total number and percentage of labelled neurons in all thalamic nuclei. The values from all ventrolateral thalamic nuclei were analyzed separately, including a distinction between the labeling found in the rostral and caudal parts of the nuclei ventral lateral, pars caudalis (VLc) and ventral posterior lateral, pars oralis (VPLo; see below), whereas those of the various intralaminar nuclei were grouped together. This finding indicates that our data on the source of the thalamic input to a given area were apparently not seriously affected by the above-mentioned factors. The definitions of the various thalamic nuclei were made according to the cytoarchitectonic criteria and the nomenclature of Olszewski (1952), except for the ventral lateral thalamic nuclei, which were also defined according to previously described cytoarchitectonic criteria (Matelli et al., 1989). In particular, the cytoarchitectonic border between VLc and VPLo was defined only at those thalamic levels in which also area X is present, that is, according to the atlas of Olszewski (19521, rostral to the AP level 8.1-8.7. In this thalamic sector, VLc and VPLo are generally partially separated by the caudal part of nucleus VLo. Thus, this thalamic sector was considered as a single entity and is referred to as the VPLo/VLc complex. In a previous study on the thalamic input to inferior area 6 and area F1, the 63 Fig. Photomicrographs of fluorescent tracers or wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP)-labeled thalamic neurons visualized by epifluorescence or brightfield illumination, respectively. Following tracer injections into the various areas of mesial and superior area 6, most of the thalamic labeling was observed in the motor thalamus WLo, area X, the ventral lateral nucleus, pars medialis (VLm), VLc, VPLo, the VPLo/VLc complex, and the ventral anterior nucleus (VA)]. In the first part of these Results, we will present the data on the cortical projections of the motor thalamus. A detailed analysis of the frontal projections from the intralaminar system and from the posterior thalamus was outside of the aims of the present study; therefore, only quantitative data. Motor thalamus projections to F3 (SMAproper) F3 was injected in three monkeys. Figure 4 shows the distribution of retrogradely labeled cells in selected stereotactical AP levels through the ventrolateral thalamus following an irljection of WGA-HRP in case 2. Dense labeling was also found in VApc, VLm, VLc, VPLo, and in that part of motor thalamus in which VPLo and VLc fuse according to Matelli et al. The number and percentage of the labeled thalamocortical neurons in the various nuclei are indicated in Table 3. Also, in this case, the most densely labeled thalamic nucleus was VLo. The number and percentage of the labeled thalamocortical neurons in the various thalamic nuclei are indicated in Table 3. Distribution of retrogradely labeled thalamic neurons following WGA-HRP injection into the trunk representation of F3. The locations of the injection sites and the thalamic distribution of the marked cells with the two tracers are illustrated in Figure 6. However, the neuronal populations labeled with the two tracers had a differential distribution in the motor thalamus, being almost well segregated in some nuclei and overlapped in others. Table 3 shows the number and percentage of the labeled thalamocortical neurons in the various thalamic nuclei. Figure 7 shows the percentage of neurons in the various thalamic nuclei that projected to F3. It can be seen that the major ventrolateral thalamic input comes from VLo. Several others thalamic nuclei have minor but significant contributions. Among the motor thalamic nuclei, only the projections from area X were almost negligible. Motor thalamus projections to F6 (pre-SMA) Three injections of tracers were made in F6 in two monkeys. The location of the injection site and the distribution of the labeled cells in selected thalamic levels are shown in Figure 8. The thalamic labeling was markedly different from that observed following injections in F3. The most densely labeled nucleus in the motor thalamus was VApc, but strong labeling was found also in area X. Table 3 shows the number and percentage of the labeled thalamocortical neurons in the various thalamic nuclei. The densest labeling in the motor thalamus, again, was in VApc, followed by area X. The general contribution of each thalamic nucleus to the projections to F6 is shown in Figure 7. The major source of inputs to F6 from the ventrolateral thalamus is made up of VApc and area X. Motor thalamus projections to F2 Two injections of fluorescent tracers were made into the caudal part of F2 in case 10, one medial (TB) and one lateral (FB) to the superior precentral sulcus (Fig. Distribution of retrogradely labeled thalamic neurons following WGA-HRP injection into the armitrunk representation of F3 in a series of selected coronal sections.

Quantitative data on the contribution of single thalamic nuclei to F2 are presented in Figure 7. Motor thalamus projections to F7 Two tracer injections were made into the dorsal part of F7 in two monkeys. The location of the injection site and the distribution of the thalamic labeling of case 9 (WGA-HRP) are illustrated in Figure 12. Note that the labeling of VAmc is a peculiar characteristic of the thalamic projections to the dorsal part of F7 and was not found following injections into the other areas forming the superior and mesial sectors of area 6. Both VLo and VPLo did not appear to contribute to the thalamic projections to the SEF. Only few scattered labeled neurons were found in the posterior thalamus. The thalamic labeling was essentially the same as that observed in case 9, the only difference being slightly stronger contributions of VAmc and the VPLo/VLc complex. 14) shows that the thalamic nuclei projecting to the two parts of F7 differ in several aspects. The thalamocortical neurons projecting to dorsal F7 (SEF; case 9) occupied almost the whole rostrocaudal extent of the lateral part of MD (AP +9.3 to +2.7). DISCUSSION General organization of thalamocortical projections to the agranular frontal cortex In the first systematic study of the thalamocortical projections to the frontal agranular cortex made with neuronal tracers, Kievit and Kuypers (1977) reported that tracer injections made into a given cortical region produced a retrograde labeling in the thalamus that was organized in longitudinal bands extending across several thalamic nuclei. Thus, according to these authors, each cortical region receives thalamic afferents from several thalamic nuclei, and each nucleus projects to several cortical regions. However, because of the large extent of the injection sites, the possibility remained that more restricted injections could produce labeling in a single thalamic nucleus. Indeed, a different model of thalamocortical connectivity was proposed by Schell and Strick (1984) on the basis of a series of injections made into area 4, SMA, and postarcuate cortex. These authors reported that each of these cortical regions receives a massive and virtually unique input from a single thalamic nucleus and that each of these nuclei projects almost exclusively to one single cortical area. Distribution of retrogradely labeled thalamic neurons following FB and TB injections into the arm and leg representations of F2, respectively, in a series of selected coronal sections. This point of view was not confirmed by a number of subsequent studies, which demonstrated that restricted injections of tracers made into different parts of the agranular frontal cortex produced labeling in several thalamic nuclei (Miyata and Sasaki, 1984; Goldman-Rakic and Porrino, 1985; Ilinsky et al., 1985; Wiesendanger and Wiesendanger, 1985a; Darian-Smith et al., 1990; Nakano et al., 1993; Inase and Tanji, 1994). The results of all these studies show that each injected area and even a single somatotopic field within a given area receive thalamocortical projections from a multiplicity of thalamic nuclei, although in different proportion. Thus, each frontal agranular area appears to be the site of convergence of thalamic inputs originating from different thalamic nuclei, and each thalamic nucleus appears to distribute its output to several different cortical areas. Thalamic input to mesial and superior area 6 A main finding of the present study is that the sets of thalamic nuclei projecting to F3, F6, F2, and F7 are markedly different both qualitatively and quantitatively. However, F3 receives consistent projections from the VPLoiVLc complex, VApc, VLc, VPLo, and VLm in the motor thalamus and from MD, mostly from its ventral and caudal part. These authors also found that the thalamic input to F3 originates mainly in VLo and as well as in several other thalamic nuclei. Evidence in favor of a multiplicity of sources of the thalamic input to F3 can be found in other studies, in which, although no distinction was made between F3 and F6, it is possible to attribute the location of the injection to F3 only. Following injections into F6, the set of labeled thalamic nuclei is markedly different from that projecting to F3. The most heavily labeled nuclei in the motor thalamus are VApc and area X, whereas the labeling in VLo is very poor. (19931, in which labeling was found in thalamic nuclei projecting to both F3 and F6. In that case, the labeling observed in the thalamus has a distribution very similar to the labeling observed in the present study. Wiesendanger and Wiesendanger (1985a) reported that there was a gradual shift in the labeled thalamic territory as one moved from the caudal to the rostra1 portion of SMA. Distribution of retrogradely labeled thalamic neurons following WGA-HRP injection into the dorsal part of F7 (SEF) in a series of selected coronal sections. Distribution of retrogradely labeled thalamic neurons following FB injection into the dorsal part of F7 (SEF) in a series of selected coronal sections. Distribution of retrogradely labeled thalamic neurons following DY injection into the ventral part of F7 in a series of selected coronal sections. For the sake of comparison, each case is presented as the left thalamus. The abrupt change in the thalamic connectivity as one moves from F3 to F6 is very clear if one compares the results of case 1, in which the injection made into the arm field of F3 and the injection made into the caudal part of F6, although they were very close anatomically, produced a markedly different distribution of labeling in the thalamus. Also, the thalamic connectivity of F2 is different from that of F3. The highest thalamic contribution to F2 originates in the VPLo/VLc complex and VLc in the motor thalamus and in the lateral and caudal parts of MD. There are very few reports in the literature concerning the thalamic input to F2. However, the location of the injection shown in their Figure 2 appears to be rostral with respect to that of the present study, so that the labeling in VApc and in area X could be due to an involvement of F7 or to a difference in the thalamic input to the part of F2 closer to the arcuate sulcus. In a recent study, Inase and Tanji (1994) injected F2 in a location similar to our FB injection of case 10, and the described location of the labeling in the ventrolateral thalamus was also similar, with the exception that the rostralmost part of the labeling was attributed by those authors to VApc. The thalamic connectivity of the dorsal part of F7 (SEF) differs from that of F6, in that it receives stronger input from area X, weaker input from VApc, and consistent labeling of VAmc. The thalamic connectivity reported here is in substantial agreement with that shown in previous reports (Huerta and Kaas, 1990; Shook et al., 1991). In agreement with these physiological findings, the thalamic distribution of labeling observed following injection into ventral F7 was very M. MATELLI AND G. LUPPINO different from that in dorsal F7. The main characteristic of thalamic input to ventral F7 is its strong projection from MD that, alone, constitutes one-third of the whole thalamic input to this F7 sector. Although these findings derive from one injection only, a similar distribution of labeling in the motor thalamus was also observed by Nakano et al. Somatotopic organization in the motor thalamus In their classical study, Kievit and Kuypers (1977) described a mediolateral topographical arrangement of the thalamic connectivity that was found to depend on the location of the injected region. The frontal cortex was subdivided by these authors into seven transverse cortical strips that receive fierents from seven longitudinal bands of thalamic neurons. The more rostral cortical strip receives projections from the medialmost thalamic band, and progressively more caudally located cortical strips receive afferents from progressively more laterally located thalamic bands. Although this type of organization is valid in its main lines, it appears that, in some nuclei of the motor thalamus, the mediolateral topography reflects the somatotopic organization of cortical areas in addition to the above-mentioned general topographical arrangement. Among the nuclei of the motor thalamus that predominantly contribute to the thalamocortical projections to the agranular frontal areas, the VPLoiVLc complex shows the least clear somatotopic organization. Injections made into leg, arm, face, and eye fields of various agranular areas (see also Matelli et al., 1989) produce largely intermingled labelings, especially in the medial part of this thalamic region. Cortical targets of basal ganglia and cerebellar circuits There is a convergent series of data showing that basal ganglia and cerebellar outputs reach different, wellsegregated targets in the ventrolateral thalamus and in MD (Kuo and Carpenter, 1973; Carpenter et al., 1976; Kim et al., 1976; Percheron, 1977; Stanton, 1980; Kalil, 1981; De Vito and Anderson, 1982; Asanuma et al., 1983a,b; Ilinsky et al., 1985, 1993; Ilinsky and Kultas-Ilinsky, 1987; Tokuno et al., 1992; Yamamoto et al., 1992; Percheron et al., 1993; Inase and Tanji, 1994, 1995; Rouiller et al., 1994). According to these data, the thalamic targets of the pallidal outflow are VApc, VLo, VLm, and possibly VLc (see below), the nigral efferents reach VAmc and MD, and the cerebellar output terminates in VPLo, VLc, area X, VLps, and MD. Figure 16 shows the relative contribution of the various thalamic inputs to each of the mesial and superior area 6 areas. Thus, according to the present data as well as previous data from the literature, the convergence of pallidal and cerebellar inputs on a single cortical area appears to be a general rule of the organization of the thalamocortical projections of all agranular frontal areas. However, a deeper analysis of our data clearly indicates that the pallidal or cerebellar inputs received by each area originate from different thalamic nuclei. This differential input to the rostral and caudal areas may be functionally relevant in the light of a series of data, suggesting that both the basal ganglia and cerebellar outflow may be considered to be constituted of several independent anatomical and functional pathways that relay in different thalamic nuclei. There are no recent reports on the pallidal efferents to the thalamus; thus, the possibility that the sensorimotor, associative, and limbic territories of the globus pallidus could have different targets in the thalamus need to be investigated further. Relative percentage contribution of the various thalamic inputs to each of the mesial and superior area 6 areas. The values of the nuclei that receive the same input (VApc, VLo, and VLm from basal may be described as a series of five parallel, functionally segregated circuits that include different cortical regions, basal ganglia sectors, and thalamic nuclei. VApc and MDpc are the thalamic targets of the dorsolateral prefrontal circuit, whereas the medial parts ofVAmc and MDmc are targets of the lateral orbitofrontal circuit. (1994), who showed that only in VLo and VLm is there an overlap between the distribution of the pallidothalamic projections and the origin of thalamic projections to F3. (19921, with a double-tracer experiment, and Hoover and Strick (19931, with transneuronal transport of viruses, showed that the pallidal efferents that overlap with the thalamic source of input to caudal mesial area 6 (F3) originate in the sensorimotor territory of the globus pallidus. This thalamic territory projects also to the FEF (Huerta et al., 1986; Shook et al., 1991). Therefore, it appears that F6 and F7 receive their main pallidal afferents from the same thalamic territory that projects also to the prefrontal cortex. There is evidence that, similar to basal ganglia outflow, the cerebellothalamic output has a precise topographic organization. The caudal parts of the cerebellar nuclei project medially to the cerebellar recipient thalamic sector, whereas the rostral parts project more laterally (Stanton, 1980; Kalil, 1981; Asanuma et al., 1983a,b). (1983a,b) hypothesized that this topographic arrangement was a consequence of a somatotopic organization of the cerebellothalamic pathway. This interpretation was based mainly on the data then available, which suggested the existence of a mediolateral somatotopic organization in the cerebellar recipient thalamus with a face representation located medially, in area X and in the medial part of the VPLo/VLc complex, and with arm and leg representations located more laterally, in VPLo and in the WLoIVLc complex. Accordingly, the observed gradient of terminations in the thalamus of the cerebellar efferents could depend on the presence of a rostrocaudal somatotopic organization in the cerebellar nuclei, in which the face is represented caudally, the leg is represented rostrally, and the arm is represented in between. However, there are several subsequent findings that suggest a different interpretation of the cerebellothalamic topography: 1) Area X and VPLo project to different cortical areas (Schell and Strick, 1984; Matelli et al., 1989; Darian-Smith et al., 1990); 2) area X projections to the face and arm fields of inferior area 6 have a mediolateral organization inverted with respect to that of VPLo; and 3) the medial part of the VPLoIVLc complex shows a less clear somatotopic organization. The thalamic labeling in the cerebellar recipient thalamus following injections into F1 and F3 was found mainly in VPLo, VLc, and the VPLo/VLc complex, whereas, following injections into F6 and postarcuate cortex, it was located mainly in the central part of area X. Recently, the caudal parts of the dentate and posterior interpositus were found to be transneuronally labeled following injections of viruses into the FEF, with a thalamic labeling in the medial part of area X, in the lateral part of MD, and in VA (Lynch et al., 1994). Finally, with the same method, it was shown that injections into area 46 produced labeling in the ventralmost parts of dentate and posterior interpositus (Middleton and Strick, 1994), with a thalamic labeling in MD, VApc, and VLc. Although it would be nice to have experimental data on this issue that were obtained with a more direct approach, these data strongly suggest that, in an analogy to the basal ganglia circuitry, the cerebellar outflow may also be composed of several parallel anatomical circuits, each of them involving different sectors of cerebellar nuclei, reaching different thalamic regions, and terminating in different cortical sectors.

MATELLI AND G. LUPPINO appears that F3 and F2 are influenced by the rostral and dorsal parts of cerebellar nuclei by means of a thalamic relay in VPLo, VLc, and the VPLoIVLc complex, whereas F6 and ventral F7 are influenced by ventral and caudal parts of cerebellar nuclei by means of a thalamic relay in the central part of area X. MD input to superior and mesial area 6 Nucleus MD is generally considered to be the main source of thalamic input to the prefrontal cortex (Walker, 1940a,b; Akert, 1964; Kievit and Kuypers, 1977; Goldman-Rakic and Porrino, 1985; Russchen et al., 1987; Barbas et al., 1991; Siwek and Pandya, 1991; Ray and Price, 1993). The amygdala, basal forebrain, and hypothalamus project mostly medially in MDmc (Porrino et al., 1981; Aggleton and Mishkin, 1984; Russchen et al., 1987; Hreib et al., 1988), whereas the projections from the cerebellar nuclei, substantia nigra, superior colliculus, and spinal cord tend to terminate more laterally (MDmf, MDpc, and MDdc), with a certain degree of overlap (Carpenter et al., 1976; Percheron, 1977; Harting et al., 1980; Stanton, 1980; Ilinsky et al., 1985; Apkarian and Hodge, 1989; Yamamoto et al., 1992; Craig et al., 1994; Rouiller et al., 1994). In particular, MDmf appears to be a site of convergence of nigral, cerebellar, and collicular projections, whereas mostly cerebellar and spinothalamic projections converge in MDdc. This part of MD appears to be one of the targets of the spinothalamic pathway, according to Apkarian and Hodge (1989) and Craig et al. LITERATURE CITED Aggleton, J.P., and M.

The results showed that each of these areas receives afferents from a set of thalamic nuclei and that this set differs, qualitatively and quantitatively, according to the injected area. All of the injected areas receive a strong projection from the medial dorsal nucleus (MD). Although there are several reports in the literature concerning the thalamic input to superior or mesial area 6, in most of them, no systematic attempt was made to correlate the location of the injection sites with anatomically or physiologically well-defined areas (Kievit and Kuypers, 1977; Miyata and Sasaki, 1983, 1984; Schell and Strick, 1984; GoldmanRakic and Porrino, 1985; Ilinsky et al., 1985; Wiesendanger and Wiesendanger, 1985a; Darian-Smith et al., 1990; Nakano et al., 1993; Inase and Tanji, 1994). In addition, in the few studies in which the physiological properties of the injected areas (SEF: Huerta and Kaas, 1990; Shook et al., 1991; SMA-proper: Tokuno et al., 1992; Rouiller et al., 1994; Shindo et al., 1995; superior area 6: Kurata, 1994) were assessed, the quantitative contribution of each thalamic nucleus was not reported. However, in both of the abovementioned studies, the locations of the injection sites were not correlated with architectonical or physiological data. More recently, injections of tracers were made into F3 (SMA-proper) following physiological definition by Rouiller et al. In the present study, injections of tracers into F3 and F6 were made after physiological identification of the two areas, and the locations of the injections were correlated with their cytoarchitectonic boundaries. In addition, the number and percentage of retrogradely labeled cells in each thalamic nucleus were determined in order to assess the exact contribution of each nucleus to the injected area. In all animals retrograde transport of neuronal tracers injected into the cortex was used to define the origin of thalamic input to mesial and superior area 6. In all animals but one (case lo), the injections of tracers were made following electrophysiological identification with intracortical microstimulation of the injected sites. Table 1 summarizes the monkey species, the physiological procedure employed, and the body movements evoked at the injection sites. In case 10, the injection sites in F2 were chosen by using the superior precentral sulcus as an anatomical landmark, on the basis of previous physiological studies (Weinrich and Wise, 1982; Kurata, 1989; Godschalk et al., 1990). Tracer injections and histological procedures Once the appropriate cortical site was chosen, wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP; 4% in distilled water), fast blue (FB; 3% in distilled water), true blue (TB; 5% in distilled water), or diamidino yellow (DY, 2% in 0.2 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.2) was slowly pressure injected through a glass micropipette (tip diameter 50-100 km) attached to a 1 pl Hamilton microsyringe. Table 2 summarizes the locations of the injections, the injected tracers, and their amounts. The tracers injected into the medial cortical convexity were delivered at 1.5 mm below the pial surface. Those injected into the mesial cortex were delivered at different depths from the cortical crown; the locations were based on the electrophysiological results. Following each injection, the dural flap was sutured, the bone was replaced, and the superficial tissues were sutured in layers. After survival periods of 2 days following WGA-HRP injections and of 12-14 days following fluorescent tracer injections, each animal was anesthetized with ketamine hydrochloride (15 mg/kg, i.m.) followed by an intravenous lethal injection of sodium thiopental and was perfused through the left cardiac ventricle by one of the following fixation procedures: 1) the fixation procedure described by Mesulam (1982; cases 3 and 9); 2) 0.9% sodium chloride, 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 10% sucrose, and 1.5% dimethyl sulfoxide in the same buffer (cases 1, 2, and 4); or 3) 0.9% sodium chloride, 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, 5% glycerol in the same buffer (case 10; Rosene et al., 1986). The extent of each WGA-HRP injection site was taken to be the densely stained region adjacent to the needle track and the surrounding halo. Each dye injection site had two concentric zones: 1) an inner zone, which was sharply delineated around the needle track, that appeared necrotic and intensely fluorescent; and 2) a second, less sharply delineated zone that was less brilliantly fluorescent. The outer border of the second zone was considered to be the border of the injection. To determine the locations of the injection sites, Nissl and cytochrome-oxidase-stained material was used to identify the various areas of the agranular frontal cortex following the criteria defined by Matelli et al. The borders between the different areas and the extent of the injection sites were then plotted on individual section drawings and were mapped onto an unfolded view of the cortical surface of the hemisphere. The stimulation sites were plotted on unfolded views of the cortical surfaces, and the stimulation maps were then superimposed on the cytoarchitectonic maps and correlated with the locations of the injection sites. In all cases and for all tracer injections, the thalamic labeling was quantified by counting all of the marked neurons in each plotted section and by determining the total number and percentage of labelled neurons in all thalamic nuclei. Several factors (e.g., differences in tracer sensitivity, differences in the amount and spread of the used tracer, differences in the laminar cortical involvement if mesial vs. dorsolateral convexity injections are compared) may account for the differences observed among the various cases in the total number of labeled neurons. Despite this variability, the percentage distributions of the labeling observed for injections of different tracers into the same area were almost similar. RESULTS Figure 3 summarizes the locations of the injection sites in all monkeys, The figure also illustrates the mesial and superior agranular frontal areas subdivided according to 10969861, 1996, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1096-9861(19960812)372:1<59::AID-CNE6>3.0.CO;2-L by Rwth Aachen Hochschulbibliothe, Wiley Online Library on [12/09/2023]. Location of injection sites plotted onto a dorsal and mesial views of a single hemisphere. Following tracer injections into the various areas of mesial and superior area 6, most of the thalamic labeling was observed in the motor thalamus WLo, area X, the ventral lateral nucleus, pars medialis (VLm), VLc, VPLo, the VPLo/VLc complex, and the ventral anterior nucleus (VA)]. The second part will be devoted to describing the MD projections to the injected areas. Motor thalamus projections to F3 (SMAproper) F3 was injected in three monkeys. The injection site (Fig. The results of microstimulation and the comparison with the somatotopic maps suggest that the injection involved the cortex that controls axial movements. The injection site (Fig. In case 1, two injections of fluorescent tracers were made into F3, one (DY) in the midrostral part, physiologically corresponding to the arm field, and one (TB) in the caudal 10969861, 1996, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1096-9861(19960812)372:1<59::AID-CNE6>3.0.CO;2-L by Rwth Aachen Hochschulbibliothe, Wiley Online Library on [12/09/2023].

The extent of the injection site (black area), plotted onto the flattened dorsal and mesial view of the hemisphere, is shown on the upper left. The locations of the injection sites and the thalamic distribution of the marked cells with the two tracers are illustrated in Figure 6. Following injections into the leg field, TB-labeled neurons were found laterally, whereas, following injections into the arm field, DY-labeled neurons were found centrally in these nuclei. The values represent the mean values of all F3 injections. Motor thalamus projections to F6 (pre-SMA) Three injections of tracers were made in F6 in two monkeys. In case 4 (left hemisphere), an injection of DY was made into the rostral part of F6. The location of the injection site and the distribution of the labeled cells in selected thalamic levels are shown in Figure 8. The thalamic labeling was markedly different from that observed following injections in F3. In the right hemisphere of case 4, an injection of FB was made into the caudal part of F6. The location of the injection and the results obtained are shown in Figure 9, and the quantitative data are shown in Table 3. Figure 10 illustrates the results obtained following an injection of FB into the caudal and dorsal edge of F6, just rostral to the F6-F3 cytoarchitectonic border. One can see from the figure and from Table 3 that the distribution of the labeling was substantially the same as that observed in the two other injections into F6, the only difference being a more dense labeling in VApc. Motor thalamus projections to F2 Two injections of fluorescent tracers were made into the caudal part of F2 in case 10, one medial (TB) and one lateral (FB) to the superior precentral sulcus (Fig. According to previous physiological data, the medial injection site should correspond to F2 leg field, whereas the lateral injection should corresponds to the arm field (Weinrich and 10969861, 1996, 1, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1096-9861(19960812)372:1<59::AID-CNE6>3.0.CO;2-L by Rwth Aachen Hochschulbibliothe, Wiley Online Library on [12/09/2023].

The extent of the injection sites is shown on the upper left. Following both injections, the heaviest labeling was found in the VPLoIVLc complex. Dense labeling was found also in VLc following the medial injection and in VPLo following the lateral injection. Some labeling was found in VLo and, in the case of the lateral injection, in VLm. Motor thalamus projections to F7 Two tracer injections were made into the dorsal part of F7 in two monkeys. The location of the injection site and the distribution of the thalamic labeling of case 9 (WGA-HRP) are illustrated in Figure 12. Note that the labeling of VAmc is a peculiar characteristic of the thalamic projections to the dorsal part of F7 and was not found following injections into the other areas forming the superior and mesial sectors of area 6. Figure 13 shows the results of the second monkey, in which dorsal F7 was injected (case 2, FB). One tracer injection (case 2, DY) was made into the ventral part of F7. A microelectrode exploration of F7, which was made before the injection, showed that, unlike dorsal F7, no eye movements could be evoked from this part of F7. The results of the tracer injection experiment are illustrated in Figure 14. A comparison between dorsal and ventral F7 injections (compare Figs. The location of labeling within MD varied, although with some overlap, following injections into the different areas of the agranular frontal cortex, and it did not respect strictly the cytoarchitectonic boundaries of MD subdivisions according to Olszewski (1952). The rostrocaudal extent of the Iabeling observed following injections into F2 (case 10) was similar to that following injection into F3 (AP +6.0 to +3.0). The two territories partially overlapped in the ventral and caudal parts of MD, whereas, more rostrally, the labeling following F2 injections was located more dorsally and laterally than the labeling seen following F3 injection. DISCUSSION General organization of thalamocortical projections to the agranular frontal cortex In the first systematic study of the thalamocortical projections to the frontal agranular cortex made with neuronal tracers, Kievit and Kuypers (1977) reported that tracer injections made into a given cortical region produced a retrograde labeling in the thalamus that was organized in longitudinal bands extending across several thalamic nuclei. However, because of the large extent of the injection sites, the possibility remained that more restricted injections could produce labeling in a single thalamic nucleus. Indeed, a different model of thalamocortical connectivity was proposed by Schell and Strick (1984) on the basis of a series of injections made into area 4, SMA, and postarcuate cortex. Distribution of retrogradely labeled thalamic neurons following FB and TB injections into the arm and leg representations of F2, respectively, in a series of selected coronal sections. The extent of the injection sites is shown on the upper left. This point of view was not confirmed by a number of subsequent studies, which demonstrated that restricted injections of tracers made into different parts of the agranular frontal cortex produced labeling in several thalamic nuclei (Miyata and Sasaki, 1984; Goldman-Rakic and Porrino, 1985; Ilinsky et al., 1985; Wiesendanger and Wiesendanger, 1985a; Darian-Smith et al., 1990; Nakano et al., 1993; Inase and Tanji, 1994). Unfortunately, in most of these studies, no attempt was made to correlate the location of the injection site with architectonical and/or physiological properties of the injected area. Exceptions to this are some more recent studies, in which tracer injections were made under physiological control into inferior area 6 and area4 (Matelliet al., 19891, in area4 (Holsapple et al., 1991; Inase and Tanji, 1995), in F3 (Rouiller et al., 1994; Shindo et al., 1995), in caudal superior area 6 (Kurata, 19941, and in the SEF (Huerta and Kaas, 1990; Shook et al., 1991). The results of all these studies show that each injected area and even a single somatotopic field within a given area receive thalamocortical projections from a multiplicity of thalamic nuclei, although in different proportion. Following injections into F3 (SMA-proper), the most heavily labeled nucleus is VLo. The percentage of labeling found in this nucleus varied from 21.2 to 30.7 in the different cases (mean value 25.6%), and it was very similar for arm and leg field injections (30.7 vs. 27.7%, respectively). (1995), in which the arm field of F3 was injected. Evidence in favor of a multiplicity of sources of the thalamic input to F3 can be found in other studies, in which, although no distinction was made between F3 and F6, it is possible to attribute the location of the injection to F3 only. This appears to be the case for the injections into the caudal portion of mesial area 6 of the study of Wiesendanger and Wiesendanger (1985a) and of the SMA injection of Darian Smith et al. Following injections into F6, the set of labeled thalamic nuclei is markedly different from that projecting to F3. The percentage of labeling in VApc is much higher than that seen following injections into F3. In addition, MD is much more heavily labeled following F6 than following F3 injections. Because SMA was classically considered to be coextensive with the whole extent of mesial area 6, it is difficult to find reports in the literature of tracer injections that can be attributed to F6 only (most of them involved both F3 and F6). However, in the case of the SMA injection reported by Miyata and Sasaki (1984), the injection site appears to be located well in front of the AP level of the genu of the arcuate sulcus; thus, presumably, it is into F6. Those authors reported that injections made caudally (presumably in F3) produced labeling mostly in VLo and VLc, whereas injections made rostrally (presumably in F6) produced labeling mostly in VApc, area X, and VLc. Finally, injections made into the middle one-third of mesial area 6 produced labeling mainly in VLo and VLc but also in VApc and area X.

The abrupt change in the thalamic connectivity as one moves from F3 to F6 is very clear if one compares the results of case 1, in which the injection made into the arm field of F3 and the injection made into the caudal part of F6, although they were very close anatomically, produced a markedly different distribution of labeling in the thalamus. (1990), the injections that are classified as being located in area 6aa, instead, appear to be located rostrally, probably in F7. (1993), following their 6DC injections, in addition to observing labeling in VLc, also observed labeling in area X and VApc. However, the location of the injection shown in their Figure 2 appears to be rostral with respect to that of the present study, so that the labeling in VApc and in area X could be due to an involvement of F7 or to a difference in the thalamic input to the part of F2 closer to the arcuate sulcus. In a recent study, Inase and Tanji (1994) injected F2 in a location similar to our FB injection of case 10, and the described location of the labeling in the ventrolateral thalamus was also similar, with the exception that the rostralmost part of the labeling was attributed by those authors to VApc. Although our injections into F2 were not made under physiological control, we used the superior precentral sulcus as a useful marker in order to inject the cortical sector where a number of authors have described the presence of set-related activity, which is one of the main physiological characteristics of this area (Weinrich and Wise, 1982; Weinrich et al., 1984; Wise and Mauritz, 1985; Kurata and Tanji, 1986; Kurata and Wise, 1988; Kurata, 1989, 1993). Following injections into the part of the cortical region called the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd), from which set-related activity was recorded, Kurata (1994) observed labeling mainly in VLc and VLo, but not in VApc, and very little in area X. In agreement with these physiological findings, the thalamic distribution of labeling observed following injection into ventral F7 was very M. MATELLI AND G. LUPPINO different from that in dorsal F7. Although these findings derive from one injection only, a similar distribution of labeling in the motor thalamus was also observed by Nakano et al. (1993) in their dorsorostral area 6 injection, by Darian Smith et al. (1990) in some of their 6aa injections that did not involve the SEF region, in the area 6 injection (dorsorostral part) of Miyata and Sasaki (1983), and by Inase and Tanji (1994). Somatotopic organization in the motor thalamus In their classical study, Kievit and Kuypers (1977) described a mediolateral topographical arrangement of the thalamic connectivity that was found to depend on the location of the injected region. This somatotopic organization is also found when similar somatotopic fields are injected in other agranular frontal areas to which VPLo send minor projections, regardless of their topographic position on the cortex. In the present study, for example, injections into the arm fields of F3 and F2 produced labeling in the arm representation of VPLo, whereas injections into the leg field of the same areas produced labeling in the corresponding representation in this nucleus. The lateral part of VLo contains labeled neurons following injections into the leg field of F3 (major projection) or of F2 (minor projection), whereas, following injections into the arm field of the same areas, the labeled VLo neurons are located more centrally in the nucleus. Previous reports have also shown that injections into the leg, arm, and face fields of F1 produce labeling in the lateral, central, and medial parts of VLo, respectively (Kievit and Kuypers, 1977; Matelli et al., 1989; DarianSmith et al., 1990; Nakano et al., 1993). See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons License THALAMIC INPUT TO MESIAL AND SUPERIOR AREA 6 81 FEF (Stanton et al., 1988; Shook et al., 1991) produce labeling in the medial part of this nucleus, whereas injections into F6, in which the arm is mostly represented, or into the hand field of F5 (Matelli et al., 1989) produce labeling centrally in area X. Interestingly, the projections to the ventral F7 also originate from this part of area X, suggesting that this cortical region could be related to arm movements. Finally, injections into the face field of F5 produce labeling in the lateralmost part of area X (Matelli et al., 1989). Area X was never found to be labeled following injections into leg fields of the various agranular areas. This possibility is supported by a study of Inase and Tanji (1994), in which pallidal efferents and retrograde labeling from injections into 6DC and 6DR (possibly F2 and ventral F7, respectively) were found to overlap in the rostral part of VLC. The rostral and lateral parts of substantia nigra have been found to be labeled also by transneuronal transport of viruses injected into FEF (Lynch et al., 1994). Several data pointing in this direction include: 1) The corticostriatal projections of F6 and of ventral F7 reach mainly the associative territory of striatum (Kunzle, 1978, 6D injections; Parthasarathy et al., 1992); 2) pallidal neurons that are inhibited by intracortical microstimulation of the rostral part of mesial and superior area 6 (probably F6 and F7) were intermingled in the rostral and dorsal parts of globus pallidus with neurons inhibited by the stimulation of the prefrontal cortex (these neurons are spatially segregated from neurons influenced by the stimulation of area 4 and postarcuate cortex that are located more caudally and ventrally; Yoshida et al., 1993); 3) the same parts of VApc that were found in the present study to project to F6 and F7 appear to project also to dorsomedial and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (Goldman-Rakic and Porrino, 1985) or to prefrontal area 12 (Barbas et al., 1991); and 4) in contrast, the part of VApc that sends a minor projection to F3 does not appear to be labeled following injection into prefrontal cortex (Goldman-Rakic and Porrino, 1985; Barbas et al., 1991). Furthermore, on the basis of experiments in which the labeling obtained with transneuronal transport of WGA-HRP or viruses has been plotted in the cerebellar nuclei following injections into different cortical areas, it appears that the organization of the cerebellar outflow could be even more complex. The rostral and dorsal parts of the dentate and the anterior interpositus were found to be transneuronally labeled following injections of WGA-HRP (Wiesendanger and Wiesendanger, 1985b; Orioli and Strick, 1989) in F1, and a similar distribution of the labeling was observed also following injection into the caudal part of mesial area 6 (F3; Wiesendanger and Wiesendanger, 1985b). Labeling in more ventral and caudal parts of the dentate and in the posterior interpositus has been observed following injections into rostral mesial area 6 (probably F6; Wiesendanger and Wiesendanger, 198513) or into the postarcuate cortex (Orioli and Strick, 1989). The thalamic labeling in the cerebellar recipient thalamus following injections into F1 and F3 was found mainly in VPLo, VLc, and the VPLo/VLc complex, whereas, following injections into F6 and postarcuate cortex, it was located mainly in the central part of area X. Recently, the caudal parts of the dentate and posterior interpositus were found to be transneuronally labeled following injections of viruses into the FEF, with a thalamic labeling in the medial part of area X, in the lateral part of MD, and in VA (Lynch et al., 1994). Finally, with the same method, it was shown that injections into area 46 produced labeling in the ventralmost parts of dentate and posterior interpositus (Middleton and Strick, 1994), with a thalamic labeling in MD, VApc, and VLc. Given this anatomical complexity, the issue of which of these inputs may reach the motor areas through MD may be clarified only with double-tracer experiments in which specific cortical areas and the subcortical structures are injected in the same animal.",,,

Brains from our collection of Golgi stained material, comprising human brains and from baboons and macaques, were used for three-dimensional reconstructions ot thala- mic neurons (Fig. The experimental study of the cerebellar territory was done on 11 adult macaques of both sexes. The eight macaques of the preceding study [276], three adult Macaca mulatta (MM10, MMll and MM12), two Macaca arc- toides (MS4 and MS6) and three Macaca fascicularis (Mill, MI13 and MI14) received surgical lesions to the cerebellum. The experimental study of the pallidal territory was based on the results of injections in seven adult macaques of both sexes. The data from three macaques that received intrathalamic injections (MI24, MI36 and MS16) already used in previous works from the laboratory [96,106] were reanalysed. The cartography of the nigral territory was drawn from 11 macaques: five Macaca fascicularis (MI22, MI27, MI31, MI35, MI41) and one Macaca mulatta (MM18) received nigral injections of tritiated tracers. Intrastriatal injections were performed on four macaques: three Macaca fascicularis and one Macaca arctoides. Stereotaxy and cerebral cartography in macaques 3.1. Previous studies from our labora- tory established the necessity of doing the same in macaques [291,293]. Upper part: ventriculogram of a macaque in sagittal projection on a film parallel to the mid-ventricular plane. Cartography of the motor thalamus of macaques. Setting up the atlas Many previous atlases of macaque thalamus did not take much care about the metric reliability of their plates. No atlas attempted to present an average thalamus of macaque, nor any way of making corrections for macaques signifi- cantly different from the average. Available atlases of the macaque thalamus are those of Snider and Lee [336], Olszewski [261], Benevento [35], Percheron [276] and the Ilinskys [153] and four brains mapped by us for Macaca mulatta, of Shanta et al. Cartographic precision for the thalamus of macaque General position in the CA-CP system of coordinates Atlases established with reference to cranial landmarks can be compared to ours if they can be oriented in relation to the CA-CP system. In the studied species of macaques, the correction using 1CA-CP allows one to obtain a precision in the postero-anterior dimension infe- rior to 500 Ixm (around 350 Ixm). The atlas may thus be used in any species of macaque of any gender, age, body weight provided that the convenient correction of ICA-CP distance is made. Our data were obtained in strict topographical condi- tions and can be used for an accurate stereotaxy in the macaque thalamus. The same is true in macaques. Seven thalamic neurons located in the pallidal territory in the macaque had mean S of 11 + 2 and F of 73 _ 3 (the exact values of the neuron shown in Fig. The first work on macaque was Mussen's [236] in 1923. In the macaque, with Boggon [201], he unfortunately linked the nucleus ventralis caudalis and ventralis intermedius of Friedemann in a 'nucleus ventralis pars externa'. The first two works that introduced what will be refered to as the 'VA-VL system' in macaques, both appeared in 1934 (i.e., 25 years after C. Vogt's study). Olszewski's [261] celebrated study of 1952, used for years in experiments on macaques, unfortunately followed Le Gros Clark and Boggon [201], Aronson and Papez [20], and Atlas and Ingram [27] in isolating a large ventral posterior nucleus including a lemniscal and a cerebellar part caudally (which was not done by others [188,196,325,330]). Our discus- sion will be almost restricted to data obtained in primates starting from the cercopithecidae and more particularly from macaques. 17% of spinothalamic afferents are ipsilateral [15] in macaques. This is now divided in macaques into the supplementary motor cortex ('SMA', 'F3' [220], 'medial area 6') medially, the premotor dorsal cortex ('PMd', '6a', 'FB' lat, 'F2',) dorsolaterally and the premotor ventral cortex ('PMv', 'FCBm, 'inferior area 6' [219,314]) ventrolaterally. [23] on macaques specified cytoarchitectonic differences between the caudal somes- thetic nucleus and the cerebellar thalamus, the latter having considerably fewer small neurons. Ohye and Albe-Fessard [254] in macaques with an experi- mental tremor obtained after a 'VMT lesion' observed 'rythmic neurons' 'time-locked with tremor', responding to 'passive movement of the corresponding peripheral joint or when taps were applied to the muscle body'. There is no mention of a possible pallidal input in Le Gros Clark's [200] account of ""the termination of ascending tracts in the thalamus of the macaque monkey"". The present work is the first descrip- tion of the complete extent of the nigral territory in macaques. Our cartographic study shows that the extent of the nigral territory in macaques is more important than previously thought. These propor- tions seem to be reduced in the macaque [33]. In macaques, the fact that ""it remains almost completely intact following hemidecortication"" was the main reason for isolating VA ""as a separate nuclear struc- ture"" [370]. Complete separation of the three motor territories in the macaque motor thalamus The rudimentary cerebral cartography of his time led Mehler [226] to think that the nigral territory partially overlapped with the cerebellar and pallidal territories. A complete separation between cerebellar and basal ganglia territories in macaques was later demonstrated [276,353]. Most orally ('slice' I), the macaque's thalamus is made up of the nigral thalamus medially and the pallidal thalamus laterally. The complete separation between cerebellar and basal ganglia territories first demonstrated in macaques [275,276] was also found later in rodents [86]. Comparisons between macaques and man and in- traorder validity of the data Direct data on the topography of afferent territories of the human thalamus are available only in particular condi- tions, in embryos for instance [338,342]. From our data, we agree with Jones [138,171] that thalamic subdivisions in macaques can be rather confi- dently transferred to the human thalamus. [156] in macaques.Jones refers to Jones [169], Jones et al. work on lemurians or New World Cebidae, the validity of our thalamic parcellation, starting from macaques, would only cover primates, from Cercopithecidae (see [73,75,243]) to contemporary man.

Ffnelon Laboratoire de Neuromorphologie informationnelle et de neurologie expimentale du mouvement. 75015 Paris, France Accepted 12 January 1996 Abstract The functional parcellation of the motor thalamus of primates has suffered from serious historical and technical drawbacks, which have led to extreme confusion. This is a problem when thalamic stereotaxy is again being use clinically. A combination of them led to: an archaic, rigid conception of the 'thalamic nucleus'; overexploitation of cytoarchitectonic technique, comparative anatomy and cortical connections; underexploitation of subcortical afferent territories; recent misuse of these territories; hesitations in the use of the VA-VL system; and opposition between ventral ('relay') and dorsal ('associative') 'nuclei'. Precise definition of thalamic elements is provided. A thalamic 'region' is a gross topographic division corresponding to the former nuclei. The thalamic space where neurons project to a given cortical target constitutes a 'source space'. A 'thalamic nucleus' is defined as the intersection of a thalamocortical source space with one territory. The ('dorsal') thalamus is divided into 'allo-' and 'isothalamus', the latter with 'bushy' and 'microneurons'. The lateral region is isothalamic. The 'motor thalamus' makes the anterior part of the lateral region. The present work aims to analyse the functional anatomy of the 'motor thalamus' by using precise topography and three-dimensional analyses of the subcortical territories receiving from the cerebellar nuclei (part II), the medial nucleus of the pallidum (part III) and the pars reticulata and mixta of the substantia nigra (part IV). All three subcortical motor afferent territories to the motor thalamus of macaques are examined in precise cartography with three dimensional reconstructions, rotations and 'reslicing'. The motor thalamus is made up of three topographically distinct and separate territories: cerebellar, pallidal territory and nigral. The cerebellar territory, primarily dentate, also contains islands of axons from the interposed and fastigial nuclei, the vestibular nuclei and the spinothalamic tract. The intrathalamic topography observed in human patients indicates * Corresponding author. It covers the whole ventrodorsal extent of the thalamus. It is also curved in the mediolateral dimension following the lateral border of the thalamus. In relation to its afferent and efferent connections, the pallidal thalamus seems to be made up of a single piece and could be considered as the lateral oral subregion or nucleus (LO). The nigrothalamic connection has been ignored for a long time and remains undervalued. Orally the nigral territory covers the whole ventrodorsal extent of the lateral region of the thalamus. An atlas of the macaque motor thalamus, comprising twelve levels, is presented, with mean dimensions for Macaca mulatta. This produces a modified parcellation of the macaque thalamus.

General introduction The motor thalamus, the main target of thalamic stereo- taxy for several decades, is not yet fully known in spite of much previous anatomical and physiological investigation. The fact that the sources of subcortical afferents determine the kind of information received by thalamic neurons was underesti- mated. The intrathalamic topographic distribution of sub- cortical afferents had been used from the first studies in monkeys, but was later neglected. Older [276] and recent [153,282] works established that the consideration of the precise intrathalamic topography of subcortical afferent territories (i.e., the cerebral spaces occupied by the termi- nal arborisations of axons from one source, see subsection I 3.3) is the most appropriate tool for subdividing the motor thalamus. Another major limitation to the analysis of the motor thalamus, was the insufficient care devoted to cerebral cartography. The principal aim of the present work is to describe the topography of the intrathalamic distribution of subcortical afferent territories to the motor thalamus of macaques in precise cartography, based on the CA-CP ventricular sys- tem of coordinates. 3) and for the analysis of the dendroar- chitecture of the thalamus. The data from three macaques that received intrathalamic injections (MI24, MI36 and MS16) already used in previous works from the laboratory [96,106] were reanalysed. Two Macaca fascicuIaris (MI24 and MI36) and one Macaca arctoides (MS16) received intrathalamic injec- tions of WGA-HRP. The volume of the thalamic injection ranged from 0.2 to 0.6 ~1 of WGA-HRP as a 10% solution in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) 0.01 M; pH 7.4. Individ- ual variations in the posteroanterior dimension surpassed 1 cm (10.1 mm), which is about the entire size of the lateral region of the thalamus, and reached 6.9 mm in the infero- superior dimension [293]. Another major distorsion of standard stereotaxy is due to the angular displacement of the thalamus (observed by the position of the intercommissural plane ICP or CA-CP plane) in relation to the usual cranial BSP (see subsection 3.2.b). 1) was found to be the most precise for the region of the thalamus and the basal ganglia [152,276,293]. For thalamic anatomy, CP is the most precise landmark as the posterior commis- sure is tightly linked to the thalamus [274,276,293]. Lower part: the Cartesian system of ventricular coordinates used for stereotaxic placements of injections and for cartography of the thalamus. The geometry of the lateral region of the thalamus, which is curved but generally oriented with a 45angle in relation to the mid sagittal plane, leads to distorted sections when the brain is cut according to the three standard anatomical planes: coronal, sagittal and horizontal. The antero-posterior position of each transverse 50 ixm section was calculated from the number of sections separating it from one commissural point (CP for the thalamus). Three-dimensional analyses of the thalamus or of a thalamic part come under the 'analysis of solid models' [32]. Simple 'stacks' of computer-drawn outlines of a given thalamic space in precise antero-posterior positions in relation to the system of coordinates (using their Z-coor- dinate) may be useful for a first analysis of its spatial organisation (see, for instance, Fig. Cartography of the motor thalamus of macaques. Setting up the atlas Many previous atlases of macaque thalamus did not take much care about the metric reliability of their plates. No atlas attempted to present an average thalamus of macaque, nor any way of making corrections for macaques signifi- cantly different from the average. Their position and their scale were carefully set up in order to corrrespond to a mean in vivo thalamus. Available atlases of the macaque thalamus are those of Snider and Lee [336], Olszewski [261], Benevento [35], Percheron [276] and the Ilinskys [153] and four brains mapped by us for Macaca mulatta, of Shanta et al. Cartographic precision for the thalamus of macaque General position in the CA-CP system of coordinates Atlases established with reference to cranial landmarks can be compared to ours if they can be oriented in relation to the CA-CP system. When the CA-CP system is fixed, there remain individ- ual and specific variations in thalamic size. The 'length' of the thalamus and the antero-posterior position of a given plane are strongly dependent on the ventricular size or 1CA-CP (the distance between the two commissural points). The average difference in antero-post- erior positions of the same thalamic levels is 300 Ix. The distance from CP to the anterior pole of the thalamus is about the same as O1- szewski's and ours. The width of the thalamus was measured at selected anteroposterior levels and compared with those of existing atlases and other material of our own. Our data were obtained in strict topographical condi- tions and can be used for an accurate stereotaxy in the macaque thalamus. Conceptual tools for the parcellation of the thalamus 4.1. Problems with the tools for the parcellation of the thalamus The problem of thalamic terminology (see subsection 4.3.b) is strongly linked to historical technical limitations and conceptual impediments. (1) The difficulty came from a too rigid conception of the 'thalamic nucleus', already criticised by others [312]. It was postulated that a thalamic nucleus always: (a) has distinctive cytoarchitectonic structure having a particular 'function'; (b) receives its axonal input from a single source; and (c) sends its axons to a single cortical area. Such a conception, derived from the 'centers' of the associationist 'box-and- arrow model', considerably hindered progress in under- standing the thalamus. In fact, the delineation of cytoarchitectonic nuclei is delicate, indeed questionable, in many parts of the thalamus. The recent use of the afferent territories as the main tool for partitioning the primate thalamus [22,137,138,153,156,169,171] unfortu- nately led them to confuse such territories with nuclei (see subsection 5.2). (4) The overexploitation of thalamocortical connections is particularly evident in Walker's case. His fractionation of the primate thalamus relied on the localized disappear- ance of thalamic neurons after cortical lesions (Gudden's technique). The thalamocortical connections are known today to be more complex than the postulated point-to-point model. It is known since 1975 [184,341] that the thalamic spaces filled by neurons projecting to one cortical target usually do not respect nuclear or territorial borders. It is admitted now that a subdi- vision of the motor thalamus that primarily relied on projections to specific parts of the cortex would lead to a hardly interpretable picture. The structure of the thalamus is more simple yet more subtle than usually claimed but needs an analysis resorting to distinct neuronal sets. Seven thalamic neurons located in the pallidal territory in the macaque had mean S of 11 + 2 and F of 73 _ 3 (the exact values of the neuron shown in Fig. The term 'thalamic nucleus' usually refers to a single kind of 'neuronal set space' [269,272,273,279], the cytoarchi- tectonic nucleus, distinguished by a combination of mor- phological signs from the distribution and variations of the neuronal somata: density, size, staining properties, general shape and gross topography. Three other thalamic set spaces must be consid- ered [284,288,294] (see Fig. Only some thalamic parts, such as the geniculate bodies or the anterior nucleus, correspond to completely closed nuclei with a myelinic 'wall'. In the thalamus a particular separation is observed, expessed in cytoarchitectonics as a 'spacing strip'. Isothalamic neuronal species and genus. B: three-dimensional computer-aided reconstruction of two typical ""bushy' neuron of isothalamus. Neuron, at lower right, located within monkey pallidal thalamus. The bushy thalamocortical neuron at left was in the human LIL. Neurons there are the largest and most densely branched of all thalamic bushy neurons. This, alone, should lead to other bases for the parcellation of the thalamus. Definition of thalamic parts: regio, superregio, subre- gio, nucleus, pars The parcellation of the thalamus traditionally relies on large topographic subdivisions. The assignation of a thalamic part to a given territory means the supply by a particular modality of neuronal information. The fact that a thalamic place receiving a given kind of information addresses it to a given part of the cortex is also of major significance. The intersection of a territory with one thalamocortical source space is thus a second major criterion. The name to be given to such an intersection was taken from Cajal who wrote that: ""the individuality of the thalamic centers should not be based upon the aspect of such centers in Nissl or Weigert sec- tions but, above all, upon the specificity of their connec- tions. General anatomy of the thalamus and surrounding diencephalic structures 5.1. Primate diencephalon Before dealing with the motor thalamus, a brief review is made of other diencephalic elements that appear on our maps. There remains confusion concerning which cerebral elements really belong to the thalamus. The traditional partition of the diencephalon, into large ontogenic, embry- ologic subdivisions, corresponding to the 'columnar model' of Herrick-Kuhlenbeck [301], comprised, from ventrally to dorsally, the hypothalamus, the ventral thalamus, the dor- sal thalamus and the epithalamus [190,191,317]. It also outmodes the phylogenetic classi- fications into heterogeneous 'archithalamus', 'paleothalamus' and 'neothalamus' [50,71]. Perithalamus and epithalamus Some diencephalic elements differ so strongly from typical thalamic elements that they would better be consid- ered as non-thalamic. Perithalamus. The ' ventral thalamus' originating from a separate 'prosomere' [301], forms a distinctive ensemble made up of neurons belonging to the same leptodendritic neuronal genus. The term 'peri- thalamus' (from the 'perithalamic isodendritic formation' [306]) was preferred to that of 'ventral thalamus' as it is topographically more evocative. / Brain Research Reviews 22 (1996) 93-181 Table 1 Table of diencephalic elements in hierarchical order Diencephalic elements I.

The perithalamus is linked to the thalamus by collaterals from both thalamocortical and corticothalamic axons. The perithalamus degenerates after cortical lesions together with the adjoining nuclei. The neurons of the perithalamus are strongly stained for parvalbumin, which allows its separation from the first polar sections of the motor thala- mus. Epithalamus. In Rose and Woolsey's classic work [317] the 'epithalamus' comprised the 'paraventricular complex, habenular complex and the pretectal group of nuclei'. The epithalamus belongs to the same prosomere as the dorsal thalamus [301] but is such a singular entity that it deserve to be isolated. The thalamus ('dorsal thalamus'). Allo- and isotha- lamus The 'dorsal thalamus' constitutes the main part of the thalamus and may be said to constitute 'the thalamus'. The bulk of the thalamus is made up of two well-known 'neuronal genera' (see subsection 3.1). One is K~511iker's [187] 'Bushzellen' (von Monakow's [366] 'Ganglienzel- len', or 'bushcells', 'tufted cells' or 'bushy neurons') that represent aspiny 'thalamocortical projection neurons' (TPC [133,134,250]) (Fig. The ratio between the two neuronal genera varies from one thalamic subdivision to another, the average bushy/micro ratio being around 75% [89]. Microneurons may be absent in some animal species [324] or in some particular thalamic places [156]. By extension to the thalamus of terms in common use since the Vogts [363] in the cortex ('allocortex' and 'iso- cortex'), it is proposed to name 'isothalamus' the thalamic part made up of the two above described distinctive neu- ronal genera, and particularly the thalamocortical 'tufted' or 'bushy' genus. By a negative definition, thalamic parts made up of other neuronal species will be said to be elements of the 'allothalamus'. Allothalamus Allothalamic regions, made up of more deeply stained neurons surrounding the medial nucleus as an 'envelope' or 'involucrum' [127,130], had previously been grouped together in the 'formation circulaire hyperchromique' [103] or 'nucleus circularis' [120] or 'truncothalamic nuclei' [ 127,130]. It is made up of the so-called periventricular or paramedian or 'midline nuclei', including those located in the adhesio interthalam- ica (or massa intermedia). They do not receive axons from the perithalamus. In human brains, where a small remnant adhesio interthalamica is missing in 30% of cases, the periventricular region is reduced to a thin periventricu- lar layer. It is almost everywhere separated from the thalamus by a continuous capsule. They have no strong projection to the striatum [97] and particular thalamocortical connections. The 'nucleus limitans' taken in its restricted medial sense (as delineated first by Friedmann [111]), separating the thalamus from the pretectal region, is of uncertain affiliation. If, as proposed, the central complex is included within the basal ganglia, the allothalamus, restricted to the in- tralaminar and paraventricular regions, would be highly regressive in primate evolution. Isothalamus 5.2.1. Histological constitution and isothalamocortical connection The isothalamus constitutes the bulk of the thalamus. Its strong identity comes from its particular neuronal genera, particularly that of the bushy thalamocortical neurons (see subsection 4.1 .b). This and the smaller size of the local circuit neurons gives the isothalamus a fine grain structure. Axonal features also contribute in isolating adjacent thalamic elements. The lack of long axons in microneurons and the fact that bushy projection neurons have no [250] or only short initial collaterals emitted close to the soma [134] means that there are no medium or long distance intrathalamic connections and no interconnections between isothalamic parts. On the other hand, the thick myelinated axon of the bushy thalamocorti- cal neurons implies a particular kind of thalamocortical connectivity, segregated, fast-conducting and precisely di- rected to a (or several) cortical target (see subsection 5.3.f). Lesion of axonal endings in the cortex leads to neuronal death in the thalamus. The isothalamus also receives a mass of corticothalamic axons. The fact that they are much more numerous than the thalamocortical axons (and more and more in the phylogenetic scale) is an often forgotten general rule. Isothalamic superregions and regions The internal and superior laminae divide the isothala- mus into several Regios (see Table 3) that may be gathered into Superregios. Contrary to the other isothalamic regions it lacks afferents from the perithalamus. It receives a peculiar input from the mamillary body through Vicq d'Azyr's mamillothalamic tract. Their relations with the cortex are established by parasagittal bands of thalamic neurons extending continuously through the medial region and the medial part of the pulvinar [183,184]. This corresponds to a huge part of the volume of the thalamus of primates, particularly in man. The thalamic place located above the somesthetic nucleus, often separated as a distinct thalamic dorsal nucleus (as the so-called 'nucleus lateralis posterior' LP) is merely the dorsal oral extension of the lateral part of the pulvinar and therefore is consid- ered as a situs (oral and dorsal) of the pulvinar (PuOD) (level XII of our atlas), (which is simpler to consider than a 'LP-pulvinar complex'). This is a fuzzy isothalamic subdivision, close topographically and in cellular types to the pulvinar, from which it can hardly be isolated. It receives 'lower afferents' (spinothalamic and collicular), which are not as massive as for the lateral region. This part of the isotha- lamus corresponds to thalamic regions receiving major subcortical specific afferences, hence grossly representing the former 'relay nuclei'. Corresponding to the ancient 'metathalamus', this is now properly linked to the other isothalamic nuclei. It is made up of the main (so-called 'dorsal') parts of the two 'geniculate bodies' (their so-called ventral parts are elements of the perithalamus, see subsec- tion 4. l.c). The lateral region of the primate thalamus 5.3.1. Definition and delineation The lateral region of the thalamus, 'Regio lateralis' [143] (or 'lateral mass'), is defined as the thalamic region located between the internal and external medullary lami- nae lateromedially and from the anterior thalamic pole to the posterior region located caudally. The lateral region is the most differentiated part of the isothalamus. The lateral region might be considered as the 'sensorimotor thalamus'. The greatest source of confusion is generally attributed to the historical opposi- tion between two main schools of research on the primate thalamus, the Vogts' and the 'Anglo-American' (in fact the Michigan school), which used different nomenclatures. The seminal works of the former, Crcile Vogt [360] in 1909 and Friedemann [111] in 1911, were devoted to the thalamus of cercopithecus. Most later work was done on the human thalamus [361]. In the thirties, this author published a series of papers on the thalamus of various species. The thalamus was cut very obliquely, which also introduced conflicting interpretations. Later works, dominated by Walker's [369,370], were mainly founded on thalamocortical con- nections. To a large extent, Jones' VL could have meant 'motor thalamus'. This is morphologi- cally misleading as there is a clear contrast in architecture between the cerebellar thalamus and the patlidal thalamus and functionally illogical. Both constitute the 'pallidal territory of the motor thalamus'. The main concern of the 'Michigan school' was to find the same subdivisions along the whole phylogenetic scale, including non-primate species with no particular interest for the human thalamus. The thalamic anatomy of monkeys is definitely closer to that of the human thalamus than to that of non-primate species. We understand that the lack of comparison with non-primate species represents a regrettable rupture, but we believe that this is the price to be paid, for the moment, to find satisfactory solutions to the description of the primate motor thalamus. The problem of comparisons with non- primate species will be evoked briefly in part V. Another opposition between the two schools was in the selection of criteria for isolating thalamic 'nuclei'. The 'VA-VL system' ('nucleus ventralis anterior' and 'nucleus ventralis lateralis') of the 'Anglo-American' school was conversely mainly based on cytoarchitectonics and thalamocortical connections. Territories give a strong functional label to a thalamic part. The cerebellar thalamus, for instance, was topographically des- ignated as 'ventral lateral' when it is not simply ventral (as it comprises the dorsal 'VLd') nor lateral (as it comprises Olszewski's medial 'area X'). In the pallidal thalamus, the term ventral given to a dorsal part (VApc [153,156]) is illogical. The long-standing limitations of tracing tech- niques, unfortunately restricting the observed extent of the territories to the ventral tier of the thalamic lateral mass, for instance in major studies [200,354,360,370], reinforced the ventrodorsal partition. The major finding of our studies on the topography of the subcortical territories is the fact that there are no dorsal nuclei in the motor thalamus. Due to their 3-dimensional geometry, a dorsal thalamic part is generally the mere posterior exten- sion of the territory that is globally located in front of the ventral part. It is important for understanding thalamic architectural differentiation to remember that the different massive bundles arrive ventrally. Another criticism bears on the fact that recent works isolated territories as nuclei with no care for coincidence with the output thalamocortical spaces. 114 G. Percheron et al./ Brain Research Reviews 22 (1996) 93-181 There was thus an obvious need for a complete revision of the mode of parcellation and nomenclature used for the lateral region of the thalamus of primates. Rules for the nomenclature of the lateral thalamic region Thalamic parcetlation based on cytoarchitectonic crite- ria leads to too many 'nuclei', often with fuzzy borders and afferent attributions. On the contrary, topographical analysis in precise cartographic conditions shows that the primate motor thalamus covers only a few distinct, and at all points separate, subcortical afferent territories. This considerably simplified the description of the primate motor thalamus. Another important criterion for making significant subdivisions is the location of neurons sending their axons to given parts of the cortex forming fontes or thalamocortical source spaces. Our parcellation should rely on the thalamic spaces filled with subthalamic afferents (territories) and thalamo- cortical neurons projecting to a target (source spaces). It was decided that the intersection of a source space with a territory should be named a thalamic nucleus. The most didactical way of naming parts of a thalamic region would be to give them, as their first adjective, the name of the Regio to which they belong. For the element located in front of the caudal subregion, we retained the term 'intermedius' which was linked from the very beginning [360] to the thalamic part that receives cerebellar axons in monkeys. Our names or acronyms should not be seen as alternative labels for permanently established thalamic parts. Our studies will show that consideration of subcortical territories and to thalamocortical source spaces leads to a rather simple thalamic parcellation. The inferior (or parvocellular) part of the 'arcuate nu- cleus' (or 'nucleus semi-lunaris', 'noyau semi-lunaire' [360]), having no contact with the motor thalamus, is gustatory and thus separated from the dorsal part as a distinct lateral subregion: the nucleus Lateralis Arcuatus (LArc). The lemniscal territory, corresponding to the (so-called) 'ventrobasal complex of the monkey is comprised of the ventral thalamic nuclei receiving medial lemniscal, includ- ing trigeminal afferents, i.e., the nucleus VPLc and the greater part of the nucleus VPM (VPMmc)' ([172], note p. 522). Two problems will be examined in turn: the location and distribution of the spinothalamic and of the kinesthetic components. In addition to the medial lemniscus, the caudal subre- gion receives afferents from the spinothalamic tracts [15- 17,24,41-43,46,54,114,119,291,339] (see subsection 5.3). Spinothalamic neurons projecting to LC could belong to both 'ventral' (VSTT) and 'dorsal' (DSTT) spinothalamic tracts [16] or only VSTT [289], i.e., derived from the deeper 'laminae' (V). 17% of spinothalamic afferents are ipsilateral [15] in macaques. The anatomical distribution of the spinothalamic afferents led Berkley [41] to isolate a 'shell' from a 'core'. The distribution of lemniscal and spinothalamic end- ings in LC is patchy. A 'small-celled', 'CO-weak' 'compartment' (or 'domain' [310,311] or 'matrix'), distributed through LCL, 'containing only calbindin cells' selectively receives is- lands of spinothalamic endings. Following Jones [169], we believe that the so-called 'nucleus ventralis inferior' (VPI) which corresponds to the almost acellular ventral region where the bulk of lemniscal and cerebellar axons enters the thalamus, is not really a nucleus and does not deserve a particular name (see, however, the discussion in [304]). The other kind of 'VPi"" [179,189,304] described in the literature would not be a distinct topographic 'nucleus' but the included patchy spinothalamic 'compartment'. [312] recently added a 'cap' (the ""CO-weak compart- ment ... forms isolated zones throughout VPL and expands as a cap covering the posterior surface of the ventral posterior medial nucleus"" [312]), in continuity with the 'PO' region and linked to the nociceptive component of the spinothalamic system. Obviously, this component does not concern an account on motor thalamus. The exact location and nature of the thalamic part which electively receives musculo-articular information blurs the 116 G. Percheron et al. / Brain Research Reviews 22 (1996) 93-181 intrathalamic separation of the somesthetic from the motor thalamus. [6], everybody agrees on the fact that, in monkeys as well as in humans, there is a clear separation between the thalamic part receiving cutaneous messages and that receiving kinesthetic 'deep' information. [19] located spinothalamic deep units in both VPLc and VPLo (LC and LIL). Albe-Fessard and Liebeskind [8] showed that neurons of the motor cortex are sensitive to pressure on muscles and traction of tendons and speci- fied that the thalamic 'relay' was 'in the supero-antefior part of VPLc'. [180], ""the regions that we have designated as VPO and VPS ... are in a region of the thalamus that has been described as the VPLc-VPLo 'transition region' and the part of the 'shell'. Kaas [179] further complained that 'VP has been generally viewed as too expansive', made VPS a part of the 'somatosensory thalamus', and along with VPI, clearly excluded it from 'VP'. Jones and Friedman's [172] core-shell scheme included specific thalamocortical connections, the 'thin anterodorsal deep shell projecting to areas 2 and 3a and a larger central cutaneous core projecting to 3b and 1' (p. 541, see their Fig. The cortical target of the ""thalamic relay for Group I muscle afferents"" was said to be 'area 3a' ""rather than ... area 4"" [214]. The Darian-Smiths [79,80] confirmed that the thalamic neurons projecting to area 3a were located within the lemniscal territory (and not in VPLo). An anterograde study [239] conversely showed that 'the thalamic region projecting to area 3a' was 'located in the transitional shell zone interca- lated between the nucleus ventralis posterolateralis pars oralis (VPLo) and nucleus ventralis posterolateralis pars caudalis (VPLc)'. There are thus also different conceptions of the thalamic source to 3a [175]. The 'motor thalamus', with notes on isothalamocor- tical connections and the 'motor' (including diverse 'pre- motor') cortex The term 'motor thalamus' is not intended to indicate that this is the only thalamic part dealing with movement control. Other thalamic parts may intervene in motor strategies. The motor thalamus is defined, as already done in [14,150,358], by its afferent sources of 'motor' nature (cerebellum and basal ganglia) on one hand, and its 'mo- tor' (motor, premotor, accessory motor) ('precentral' [212]) cortical targets on the other hand. The connection of the 'motor' thalamus rises the ques- tion of the 'motor' thalamocortical connection. ""The first ... maintains that individual thalamic nuclei send projections to more than one cortical area and that individual areas receive inputs from two or more thalamic nuclei"". /Brain Research Reviews 22 (1996) 93-181 117 thalamic nucleus projects to a single cortical area and that each cortical area receives from a single thalamic nucleus', which would by argued by Jones [169]. Actually, the most current belief is that each thalamic nucleus would have a major and accessory cortical targets. Gener- ally, individual thalamic neurons of adult monkeys would project to one single target. All authors do not rely on same thalamic nuclei and cortical areas ('pre-SMA' was not found until 1992 [222]). Further, the model is not necessarily the same in different thalamocortical systems or subsystems. Above all, recent works showed that there is no register between spinothala- mic afferent islands and groups of thalamocortical neurons projecting to motor cortex [119] or of pallidal afferent islands with the same [159]. This should lead to a great care in assessing that a given part of the thalamus receving a given input projects to a given part of the cortex. There are as many divergent parcellations and nomen- clatures of the 'premotor' cortex [386] as for its thalamic source. We needed a base of reference for the description of the thalamocortical connections and selected the parcellation proposed by Ku- rata [194] and Matelli and Luppino [220] summarizing recent works. For us, the motor thalamus is mainly delineated by the topography of its afferent territories, which will be exam- ined in the next three parts. The motor thalamus both fails to fill entirely and oversteps the boundaries of the lateral region. However, the anterior part of the lateral region, located in front of the lemniscal territory, constitutes the bulk of the motor thalamus and will be the main concern of our studies. Introduction The position of the cerebellar territory, between the somatosensory lemniscal territory behind, and the basal ganglia territories in front, is crucial for a description of the whole lateral thalamic region, which is why its cartog- raphy and 3-dimensional analysis is examined first. Trajectory of cerebellothalamic axons The trajectory of the axons coming from the dentate and the interposed nuclei is distinct from that from the fastigial nucleus. The latter represents the cerebellothalamic bundle that passes l 18 G. Percheron et al./Brain Research Reuiews 22 (1996) 93-181 through and laterally around the red nucleus and then enter posteriorly to the H1 pallidothalamic bundle, in front reaches the ventral border of the thalamus (Fig. The cerebellar territo~ within the lateral region of the thalamus 7.3.1. Intrathalamic topography The intrathalamic distribution of the cerebellar axonal endings was identical in the lesioned and the injected monkeys. The lateral island is located along the dorsolateral border of the lateral region of the thalamus. The lateral island (and the whole territory) ends laterally and ventrally along the border of the thalamus. Relation with cytoarchitectonic subdivisions The topography of the cerebellar territory corresponds to several topographically distinct thalamic places previ- ously described in the literature as separate cytoarchitec- tonic thalamic nuclei. Probably the most easily recogniz- able cytoarchitectonic nucleus coincident with the cerebel- lar territory is a lateral and ventral thalamic site, LIL. The coincidence between the cerebellar territory and a cytoarchitectonic subdivision is also observ- able in a more medially located thalamic site, LIMm, but not in a simple manner. Other thalamic targets In its posterior part, the territory comprises the caudal part of the intralaminar complex and of the paralaminar region. Source of the cerebellothalamic connection One retrograde study showed that the source of cerebel- lothalamic axons was located in all cerebellar nuclei [353] even though only the dentate and interposed nuclei were transsynaptically labelled after cortical injections [262,375]. Trajectory of the cerebellothalamic axons The whole trajectory of the cerebellothalamic axons was shown in a previous paper [276]. This revealed their complex intrathalamic trajectory on their way to the dorsal part of the thalamus. The cerebeIlar territory, within the lateral region of the thalamus 8.3.1. Topography and shape of the cerebellar territory Contrary to the two other motor territories analysed in the later sections, the cerebellar afference to the thalamus has long since been known. The dentatothalamic connection alone [25,67], irregularly but densely, covers the whole cerebellar territory. Other afferents included within the cerebellar terri- tory (vestibular, spinothalamic) The cerebellar territory includes still other, insulate, coterritories. The existence of a vestibulothalamic connec- tion has been established only recently (see [353] for a review). In addition to more posterior thalamic targets, the lem- niscal and the basal 'posterior' (so-called 'Po') region, spinothalamic axons are also known to end within the cerebellar territory [16,18,24,25,41- 43,46,54,119,168,217,225,228] (see subsection 1 5.3e). The spinothalamic territory is not spread over the whole cere- bellar territory. Maps from [16,24,41-43,45,54,119,312] show that spinothalamic afferents are mainly located later- ally and dorsally which is shown in sagittal sections in Fig. Fine structure and immunochemistry The shape and topology of individual cerebellothalamic axons is not known in primates. The cerebellothalamic connection has been analysed at electron microscopic level [45,123,150]. A clear somatotopic organisation was found in the thalamocortical connection [81,164,220] for the ventrolateral part project- ing to the motor cortex. [23] on macaques specified cytoarchitectonic differences between the caudal somes- thetic nucleus and the cerebellar thalamus, the latter having considerably fewer small neurons. The particular cytoarchitectonic constitution of the antero-lateral part of the cerebellar thalamus was soon recognized by Friedemann [111] from the large size, dark staining and sparse distribution of its neurons. The relation of the cerebellar territory with the intermediate nucleus was confirmed by Mussen [236], Crouch and Thompson [77] who specified that 'the thalamic termination of the brachium conjunctivum is prin- cipally in the nucleus ventralis intermedius', and Borke and Van Buren [47] in the chimpanzee. A huge 'nucleus ventralis, pars lateralis' ('n.v.l') [19,27] or 'nucleus ventralis pars ex- terna' (Ve) [201] grouped together thalamic parts receiving cerebellar and lemniscal afferents. The second cause of confusion was the misiocation of the cerebellar territory in a more anterior thalamic position. The tracing of the degenerated axons after lesions of the spinothalamic tract, of the medial lemniscus and of the brachium conjunctivum led Walker [369,370] to distinguish anew a VPL (that of Crouch [76], said to be 'the same as' the 'va' of Friede- mann, i.e., C. Vogt's 'noyau ventral caudal'), receiving lemniscal afferences, from a 'VL' (thus only a part of the ""n.v.l.' To quote Walker 'the brachium conjunctivum terminates anterior to the medial lemniscus in the ventral nucleus of the thalamus'. This was not too serious as long as a so-called 'VA-VL complex' was considered to be a single motor thalamic ensemble receiv- ing convergent afferences from the pallidum and the cere- bellum [182,225,226,307]. Other thalamic targets, h2tra- and paralaminar re- gions The ending of cerebellar axons in the posterior intra- and paralaminar region [72,197,276,373] raises a problem. There is apparently no paralaminar subdivision in the human thalamus (see [89]). Non-thalamic targets Cerebellothalamic axons cross through the lateral part of the red nucleus. The cerebellorubral axons are gener- ally collaterals of the cerebellothalamic. Presence of two source spaces The terms 'cell sparse zone' [23], the VLp of Jones [171] or the VL of [153,156] led to the impression that the cerebellar thalamus is a single entity. It was initially established that the main target of the thalamic neurons receiving cerebellar information was the motor cortex [79,117,119,141,170,178,183- 185,318,321,340,341,351,353]. Schell and Strick [326] and Orioli and Strick [262] showed that the thalamic neurons located in the medial part of the cerebellar territory had a different cortical target from those located in the lateral part. Subdivisions of the cerebellar thalamus 'Thalamic nuclei' being defined as the intersection be- tween one territory and a given thalamocortical source space, the existence of at least two distinct source spaces leads to the conclusion that the cerebellar territory (subre- gio lateralis intermedia, LI), as already suggested in [220], would be made up of (at least) two nuclei. The first, lateroventral, called the nucleus lateralis inter- medius lateralis (LIL), in addition to cerebellar islands (with most of interposed, fastigial and ipsilateral islands) receives other, specific afferents: the majority of vestibular and spinothalamic islands [17,119,251,253,257]. This LIL nucleus is the fundamental thalamic source for the motor cortex, and accessorily of the ventral premotor cortex. LIM apparently does not receive much spinothalamic, vestibulothalamic or direct musculoarticular information, and could have its own 'cerebellar' somatotopic organisation. Stereotacticians' thalamic target The recent controversy concerning the nature of the thalamic target for lesions or stimulation intended to re- move tremor (most usually Parkinsonian tremor) is of major interest for human thalamic stereotaxy and thus needs a carefull and critical review. Jones' conception indeed could lead to the statement that the current thalamic target of stereotacticians is not what they think it is (i.e., V.im., a part of the cerebellar territory) but the anterior part of Vc (Vcae, a part of the lemniscal territory). Three criteria are generally used to define the thalamic target: high background activity, tremorosynchronicity and sensitivity to kinesthetic stimuli. Mrs. Fessard (personal communication) insists on a fourth crite- rion, the largest potentials observable in the thalamus, probably emanating from very large neurons (which is particularly the case of V.im neurons [139,140]). Thalamic kinesthetic zone in human patients Everybody agrees that ""the thalamic location of kines- thetic neurons .... is just rostral to the tactile neuron area"" [252] (see its Fig. [7] conversely found that the thalamic 'relay' 'from deep tissue, joints and we believe, from Group I muscle affer- ents' was in the Vim and in a region dorsal to the somesthetic nucleus (see Fig. [118] found 'thalamic potentials from mucle afferents' in 'the nucleus ventralis intermedius (Vim)'. Both were said to belong to the 'somatosensory thalamus' but to be located outside the 'VP proper'. Sources of kinesthetic signals Kinesthetic information could be brought to the thala- mus by different afferent systems: the medial lemniscus (from the dorsal column nuclei), the brachium conjunc- tivum ascendens (the cerebellothalamic tract), the spinotha- lamic tract and the vestibulothalamic tract. Another possible candidate is the spinothalamic system. The intrathalamic topography of islands of spinothalamic endings (see subsection 3.3c) grossly fits with the observed extent of the kinesthetic zone. The spinothalamic territory does not respect major territorial borders. Spinothalamic axons can convey 'deep' information [19,105]. [24] also favoured the possi- bility that 'short latency somatic sensory responses recorded in the VPLo region' 'could arise from the spinal cord', i.e., through the spinothalamic tract. Despite all this evidence, section of the spinothalamic tract has little effect on the kinesthetic response in the motor cortex [22]. Above all, an anatomical study [119] after retrograde labelling in the motor cortex and anterograde labelling in the spinal cord, did not find any overlap between islands of spinotha- lamic axons and islands of thalamocortical neurons pro- jecting to the motor cortex. The spinothalamic afferents therefore cannot be the source of the short-latency pathway to the motor cortex. An alternative candidate could be the interpositothalamic tract. Neurons in 'area 5', like thalamic neurons, are sensitive to the direction of move- ments [306,323]. The thalamic source of 'area 5' has been postulated to be posterior and basal in the 'Po' region [93]. 2 of [232], third thalamic level, where islands are falsely located within VPLc) and the anterior pulvinar (PuO and PuOD or LP) [176,232]. Strick [342] concluded ""that it is unlikely that the VL arm area in the thalamus is the thalamic origin of short-latency peripheral input to the motor cortex"". The essential thalamic source for the motor cortex is in LIL. 5 and 7 of [239] shows that the posterodorsal part of LIL overhanging the lemniscal nu- cleus, where islands of spinothalamic but also islands of cerebellothalamic axons are observed, could send axons to both the motor cortex and the 'transitional' 3a (where the shell is said to project). Ohye and Albe-Fessard [254] found 'rythmic discharges .... preferentially in and around the thalamic Vim nucleus and its dorsal part"". Narabayashi and Ohye [245] noted that the three kinds of tremors ('at rest, in posture and in movement') can all be alleviated by 'plac- ing a small coagulation lesion in the base of the ventral intermedius nucleus (VIM) of the thalamus'. They stated that: 'the generating mechanism of pathological tremor may arise at the level of the thalamus, especially in the circuitry mechanism involving the VIM as the most impor- tant structure, which might be the result of deafferentation of the thalamic structure from the cerebellar inflow'. A first problem concerns the extent of the thalamic region where tremorosynchronous neurons are observed. This could explain his wish to see the thalamic target as located more anterior than in other authors. The possible role of the part of the thalamus receiving pallidal afferences in the generation of the Parkinsonian tremor is disputed. [207] concluded that lesions of the pallidum or its thalamic target 'relieve parkinsonian rigidity more effectively than they do tremor, while lesions of the ventralis intermedius preferentially relieve tremor', which is generally admitted. 35, 50, 84, 86) or of the cerebellothalamic pathway (their Fig. Nigral territory (LR) is centered around the mammillothalamic tract (MT) and opens out dorsad. It reaches the most anterior pole of the thalamus. The cerebellar territory (LI) extends obliquely from the nigral territory to the lateral border of the thalamus. Most stereotacticians usually make very lateral lesions (from L15 or 17), which means about the border of the thalamus at this level. The efficacy of such lesions could be explained by the section- ing of thalamocortical axons, i.e., cutting the input to the motor cortex. Another explanation could be the concomi- tent destruction of perithalamic neurons and their potential- ity to induce rythmicity. In a postmortem study we showed that one efficient place for thalamic stimulation was not the posterolateral part of the cerebellar territory but a medial and inferior place close to the entrance of the cerebellar afferent axons within the thalamus (Fig. The dorsolateral lesions, and their 'physical' sectioning, and the ventromedial stimula- tion, and their artificial emission of inadequate messages, could have led to the same result, i.e., the failure of the cerebellothalamocortical system [59]. In Parkinsonian patients, afferent axons of cere- bellar origin and the corresponding receptive thalamic neurons apparently become pathologically hypersensitive. There is thus in Parkinsonian tremor (and in 'essential tremor' [163,379] and 'writing tremor' [379]) an overactivity of the cerebellothalamocortical system [379]. All PET studies conclude there is a limited role for the cerebral cortex in tremor genesis, and rather favour a complex (olivo)cerebellothalamocortical 'generator' in which the intermediate subregion has an obvious strategic position. In pathological conditions, after dopaminergic denervation, there could thus be a pathological change in the firing pattern of the cerebellar nuclei and consequently of the thalamic cerebellar territory. In lesioned monkeys with resting tremor and 'self-maintained oscillation or bursting of thalamic cells' [166] 'damage to the nigrostri- atal tract and the administration of dopamine antagonists fail to produce tremor unless associated with injury to the cerebellar axons projecting to the red nucleus and thala- mus. There are no experimental data yet on modifications of thalamic neurons within the cerebellar territory in the MPTP model. One study showed that, in the more anterior thalamic neurons located within the pallidal territory, ""somato- sensory responses"" ... ""were far more frequent, more pronounced, and less specific"" [357] than in normal mon- keys (see subsection III 3.8). There is thus an abnormal hypersensitivity of neurons in the simian thalamus. A more re- cent interpretation starts from the observation that rythmic tremorosynchronous neurons are observed within the me- dial nucleus of the pallidum and in the subthalamic nu- cleus (i.e., in components of the basal ganglia system) after MPTP treatment in green monkeys [39,40]. An- other possible mechanism explaining the tremor-locked bursting activity could be excessive corticothalamic and corticopontine activity. The motor cortex which also receives axons from the pallidal thalamus (see next part) sends axons back to the cerebellar thalamus but also to the pontine gray (which may modify cortical and nuclear cerebellar activity) and to the subthalamic nucleus (which may modify pallidal and nigral activity). Introduction The existence of the pallidothalamic connection was established by C. Vogt [360] in 1909. Unfortunate limita- tions of the first experimental work in primates by Wilson [380] led to its neglect for decades, which has been the main origin of the difficulties encountered later in the parcellation of the motor thalamus. [309] tackled this connection again experimentally and may be credited for having set it up as one of the major inputs to the primate thalamus. There is finally only a restricted number of previous works on the intrathalamic topography of the paUidal territory. Trajectory of pallidothalamic bundle makes a sudden turn close to the mamillothalamic tract (forming Forel's fields, successively, H2, H and HI). Source of the pallidothalamic axons The extent of the three intrathalamic injections of a retrograde tracer included all the thalamic regions receiv- ing axons from the pallidum. The pallidal neurons in- volved in the pallidothalamic connection were essentially located in the medial pallidum. Almost all medial pallidal neurons send their axons to the lateral region of the thalamus. Trajectory of pallidothalamic axons Pallidal axons going to the thalamus run first in an antero-medial direction (levels CP + 9.1 to + 5.45 Fig. It can be noted that the majority of pallidothalamic axons run in front of Luys' subthalamic nucleus (Fig. In the subthalamic region, pallidothala- mic axons constitute a thick bundle which goes mediad and ventrad in the direction of the mamillary body (Forel' s H2 field). Close to Vicq d'Azyr's mamillothalamic tract, the bundle bends suddenly in an upward direction with a V shape. It reaches the inferior part of the thalamus laterally (as Forel's H1 field) (see transverse levels from CP + 6 to +4.7, Figs. The entrance of pallidal axons is grossly lateral to Vicq d'Azyr's mamillothalamic tract (from level +6.2 to level +4.7, Figs. In the thalamus the axons continue their course upwards, in curved bundles or as isolated fibers, all oriented dorsally. The pallidal territo~ within the lateral region of the thalamus 11.4.1. The lateral border of the territory coincides with that of the thalamus. At the level of the entrance of the H1 pallidothalamic bundle (from CP + 5.2 to +6.2, Figs. 9) the terri- tory appears lateroventrally close to the border of the thalamus (TPa, Fig. It is close to the oral pole of the lateral region of the thalamus pierced by the many antero-posterior bundles made by thalamocorti- cal and corticothalamic axons except in the first transverse sections. The territory as a whole is indeed crescent-shaped with a strong anterior curvature and a long dorsocaudal extension that follows the dorsal border of the thalamus. Sagittal sections are thus very oblique in relation to the inner topographic organisation of the motor thalamus. Relations with cytoarchitectonic subdivisions The first important observation in the comparison of the limits of the pallidal territory with the cytoarchitectonic boundaries is that the topographic distribution of the palli- Table 2 The proposed parcellation of the lateral region of the primate thalamus, into five subregions each having a particular main subcortical afference corresponding to five territories (thalamic spaces occupied by axonal endings from one source) and to a functional 'modality' Regio lateralis L = lateral region or 'lateral mass' 1 Subregio arcuata LArc.

Rostral to the intermediate subregion of the lateral region of the thalamus (which has been shown in the preceding part II to receive cerebellar input), there are only few distinctive cytoarchi- tectonic fields. The lateral border of the cloud corresponds to the lateral border of the thalamus only in its anterior part. / Brain Research Reuiews 22 (1996) 93-181 separated from the thalamic border by islands of the larger, darker and loosely distributed neurons of the anterior pole of the nucleus Lateralis Intermedius (the anterior part of the cerebellar territory). There could thus be two pools of thalamocortical neurons. 10) a fair number of pallidal axons continue a posterior course in the infero-medial part of the lateral region of the thalamus. The stria medullaris is also fed in pallidohabenular axons by means of axons crossing through the internal capsule, reaching the upper part of the perithalamic nu- cleus and arriving dorsally to the thalamus and ventrally to the caudate nucleus. 9) to go medially and ventrally in the direction of the hypothalamus. Discussion Historically, the pallidothalamic connection was ac- cepted with difficulty. 'In view of the fact that Vogt already in 1909 had identified the continuity between the lenticular and thalamic fascicle, it is remarkable that the connection was not widely recognized until the late nine- teen thirties' [247], in fact in the late sixties. Non-thalamic pallidal targets 12.1. The source of the pallidothalamic connection From the level of the anterior pole of the central complex (CP + 3.6, Fig. 10) a significant number of palli- dal axons remain below the ventral border of the thalamus and overhang the red nucleus. It also progressively descends into the mesencephalic reticular formation and reaches the pedun- The continuity between the lenticular nucleus and the thalamus was established by C. Vogt [360] after the 'study of the myelinisation of a newborn child'. / Brain Research Reviews 22 (1996) 93-181 studies [96,264,353] all confirmed that the pallidothalamic source space is indeed restricted to the medial nucleus of the pallidum. The trajectory of pallidothalamic axons The link between the complex V-shaped Forel's fields [104] (see levels + 6-5.45 in Fig. A later study of the brain of a 2-month-old infant [356] confirmed that the pallidothala- mic tract myelinates before the cerebellothalamic tract, which makes it possible to study the particular intrathala- mic topography of the pallidal axons. The direction of the connec- tion, from the pallidum to the thalamus, was established experimentally in the monkey at first by Wilson [380] but essentially by Ranson et al. The continuity of the fascicle H1 of pallidal origin with intrathalamic, laterally located, bundles was also first observed by C. Vogt [360] and was later experi- mentally confirmed by the Ransons [308,309]. The part of Forel's H1 field which overhangs the subthalamic nucleus is made up of the pallidothalamic bundle anteriorily and of the nigrostriatal bundle more caudally. The pallidal territory within the lateral region of the thalamus 12.3.1. Topography of the pallidal territory Considering its topographic and functional importance, there has been curiously little work devoted to the palli- dothalamic connection. Nauta and Mehler [247] thought that Wilson was too scrupulous and fearing that the pallidothalamic connection might be an artifact due to a lesion of corti- cothalamic axons. Wilson actually described the trajectory and ending of the 'striothalamic fibres' in 3 monkeys (434/10 p. 451, 26/11 p. 457 and 96/11 p. 459) and specified that ""they reach the lateral and ventral sections of the thalamus"" (p. 466). It is also true that he minimized this connection (in favour of the nonexistant 'striorubral') when he wrote that ""Striothalamic fibres ... constitute the minor portion of striatofugal fibres to the optic thalamus and regio subthala- mica"". It is unfortunate that Wilson [380] did not make appropriate lesions, which led him to undervalue the palli- dothalamic connection in primates. This had regrettable effects on Walker's and subsequent parcellations of the thalamus. Neuropathological studies from the Vogts [362,364] con- finned the existence of the pallidothalamic connection. There is no mention of a possible pallidal input in Le Gros Clark's [200] account of ""the termination of ascending tracts in the thalamus of the macaque monkey"". The pallidal input to the thalamus is evoked in Walker's [370] celebrated 'Primate thalamus', only among 'other afferent connections of the thalamus', with no reference to Vogt's 'lenticular radiation', with a single, sceptical, refer- ence to Wilson. Among the new anterograde studies under- taken in the monkey by the Ransons, the first paper [308] did not show pallidothalamic fibers. Glees [125] also found that ""a considerable connection between the pallidum and the thalamus is present"". The pallidothalamic connec- tion, just mentioned in one Walker's review [371], is no longer referred to in a later one [372]. Their plates and drawings revealed that the pallidal territory was not restricted to the ventral tier of the lateral region but also reached the dorsal border of the thalamus. Due to inadequate cerebral cartography, it became common in the seventies to consider a single motor thalamic nucleus (the 'VL') as G. Percheron et al. The latest work also using autoradiog- raphy and the reference to CA-CP system [153] confirmed that the pallidal territory extends over the whole ventrodor- sal dimension of the thalamus. All confirmed our topographical data and showed that the terminations of pallidal axons within the thalamus make distinct islands, also obvious in our plates. This could mean a spatial organisation of both pallidothalamic and thalamocortical connections. Only a few neurons in 'VLo' were said to be sensitive to 'sharp pressure or release of deep tissue and taps on muscles or tendons' [166] or manipulation of a limb [11], and were topographically continuous with those in the cerebellar thalamus (in WPLo', LIL). Matelli and Luppino [220] found a somatotopic organi- sation in the thalamocortical connections with 'three al- most completely separated, vertically oriented slabs that were in continuity with those located more caudally in VPLo', which is also shown on Fig. Raeva [302] found 'triggered verbal command neurons' which would indicate that the messages sent by the pallidal thalamus to the cortex are more than simple motor orders. The pallidothalamic connection is GABAergic [3,4] and is inhibitory [11]. The cholinergic innervation of the cat thalamus has been considered to come from the pedunculo-pontine complex [101]. This was later named on cytoarchitectonic criteria 'lateral part of the oral part of ventral thalamic nuclei' by Friedemann [111]. In a brain with a pallidal lesion and the removal of the motor cortex, they observed that as 'the fibers of the fasciculus thalamicus terminated in a region of normal cells, either obviously within the nucleus ventralis anterior or in a tongue-like caudal prolongation of normal cells continuous with it, we make the statement that the fibers end in the nucleus ventralis anterior' [309]. All later researchers who analysed the topography of the terri- tory in relation to Olszewski's atlas [64,68,193,226,247] found that VLo was the main thalamic site receiving pallidal afferences. These were indeed observed in 'the rostral ventral tier thalamic nuclei (the ventral anterior VApc and the ventral lateral VLo)' [64,193,247], thus in parts of Olszewski's VL (VLo, VLm) and VA (VApc). This inferior region is not uniform, as only its lateral part corresponds to a dense gathering of pallidothalamic axons. Both nuclei are indeed said to constitute the 'patlidal territory of the motor thalamus'. The particular problem of the polar part of the thalamic lateral region wilt be examined in the next part IV dealing with the nigral territory. Other thalamic targets. Non-thalamic targets Numerous connections have been attributed to the pal- lidum (for a complete historical review see [247]). It was earlier said that the thalamocortical con- nection is made by several separate clusters of neurons [241]. Another more recent paper [159] showed that thalamocortical neu- rons projecting to the motor cortex are distributed in islands that are located outside the afferent islands of the pallidothalamic connection. The conclusion was that the majority of thalamic neurons that receive pallidal informa- tion do not send axons to the motor cortex. A transsynaptic retrograde study showed a projection of the pallidal thalamus to the frontal cortex in the principal sulcus [231]. Transsynaptic labelling [142] showed that separate groups of pallidal neurons project to the motor, supplementary motor and ventral premotor cortex, which could mean that clusters of thalamic neurons could also have specific targets. Other data [ 117,153,165] indicate a possible postero-anterior organisation of the two sources, the thalamic neurons projecting to the motor cortex having been reported to be located more caudally than those projecting to the supplementary motor cortex. ThaIamostriatal connection A connection from the thalamic region receiving palli- dal afferents to the striatum and more precisely, selectively to the sensorimotor territory in the putamen, is documented by meagre published data [97,238,335]. The homogenei~ of the pallidal thalamus Considering its afferences and efferences there are to- day few arguments in favour of heterogeneity, other than patchiness, of the thalamic region receiving pallidal infor- mation. In spite of local cytoarchitectonic variations, there appears to be a single thalamic entity that could be simply named the 'pallidal thalamus.' Pathophysiology of the pallidai thalamus In part II, we reviewed the stereotactic literature con- cerning the relief of tremor by stereotactic lesions. 45, 61, and of the pallidothalamic tract in Fig. Tremorosynchronous neurons were found in the posterior part of the pallidal thalamus in the three original papers [6,7,160] (see Fig. The discharge of thalamic neurons linked to active movement is increased before the movement and before the initial EMG activity [11]. One study showed that, in the MPTP model, ""somato- sensory responses"" ... ""were far more frequent, more pronounced, and less specific"" in thalamic neurons located within the pallidal territory than in normal monkeys [358]. In the MPTP model in green monkeys, tremorosyn- chronous neurons could be found in the medial nucleus of the pallidum [39,40] (and in the subthalamic nucleus). The pallidal territory, which is clearly separated from the cerebellar territory, could become an interesting target for thalamic intervention. The whole extent of the intrathalamic territory was observed only recently with the latest im- provements in autoradiographic technique. Source of the nigrothalamic axons In the two cases where injections of WGA-HRP were placed in the thalamic territory, the cell bodies of project- ing neurons were found, as already shown [106], in the pars reticulata and mixta (located above the pars com- pacta) and not in the pars lateralis. Trajectory of nigrothalamic axons IV CARTOGRAPHY OF THE THALAMIC TERRI- TORY OF NIGRAL AFFERENTS WITH REFER- ENCE TO VENTRICULAR COORDINATES IN THE MACAQUE 14. Introduction Historically, the role of the nigral territory in the func- tional parcellation of the primate motor thalamus was even less than that of the pallidal territory, as it was not taken into account by either of the two main schools studying the thalamus. The projection of axons from the substantia nigra to the thalamus was not known by C.Vogt [360], continuously denied by Hassler [127,129,140], and ignored by stereotacticians. The intrathalamic topography of Nigrothalamic axons do not constitute a massive bun- dle. An interesting finding was that, even if some nigrothalamic axons cross through it, the majority avoid Forel's H field and run medially to it in the hypothalamus. Nigrothalamic axons then reach the antero-inferomedial border of the thalamus where they are near and medial to pallidal axons. The intrathalamic course of nigral axons is almost vertical although curved to the rear and parallel to the mamillothalamic tract. The nigral territory in the lateral region of the thalamus 15.4.1. In its polar portion it is pierced by the many thalamocortical and corticothalamic bundles. It then surrounds the mamil- lothalamic tract. The trajectory of nigrothalamic axons from field H and close to the mamillothalamic tract is shown. The territory begins medially (CP + 8.4), its anterior part close to the mamillothalamic tract (MT). The trajectory of the nigrothalamic bundle is still visible. The main part of the nigral territory corre- sponds to the portion close to or surrounding the mamil- lothalamic tract. The most medially located thalamic neurons, being larger and more darkly stained, make a contrast with the most laterally located neurons of the pallidal territory (see levels IV and V of our atlas). As is the case for the cerebellar and pallidal territories, the dense ventral entry of nigrothalamic axons breaks up the cytoarchitecture with only few neurons (see levels IV and V of our atlas). This is also the case caudally where the territory slopes down and occupies the ventromedial part of the thalamus in front of the central complex (level VI of the atlas). The nigral territory, in other regions of the thalamus 15.5.1. Projection to non-thalamic targets The major nigrostriatal connection will not be discussed here. In the nigral thalamus, the amygdalar territory did not appear to be related to a particular cytoarchitectonic subdivisionIt was not restricted to the ventral medio- or parvocellular part as small islands were also observed in the magnocellular part. The source of the nigrothalamic connection The nigrothalamic connection was ascertained by retro- grade transport methods [34,106,265]. Our previous work comparing the intranigral location of the neurons project- ing to the striatum, the tectum and the thalamus established that there is an incomplete but clear segregation of the different source spaces. The trajectory of nigrothalamic axons The trajectory of nigrothalamic axons is best shown in sagittal sections [66,67,151]. Axons go obliquely from the substantia nigra caudoventraUy to the thalamus orodor- sally. The relation with the mamillothalamic bundle was noted. The lack of a dense nigrothalamic bundle is possi- bly one reason why the connection was not observed sooner. The nigral territory in the lateral region of the thalamus 16.3.1. Topography of the nigral territory in the lateral region The existence of a nigrothalamic connection has been accepted only slowly in the literature. In 1970, Mettler [230] was still asking ""Is there a nigrothalamic projection?"" Hassler [127,129,130] constantly rejected a nigrothalamic connec- tion, even in his ""Contribution to the problem of efferent connections of the substantia nigra"" (p. 233, [130]). As in the case of the palli- dothalamic connection, the data of the first experimental study in primates [65] led the authors to think that 'thalamic lesions observed in association with lesions of the substan- tia nigra' 'appeared to be caused by the concomitant interruption of other fiber systems' [65] or 'correlated with unavoidable interruption of other fiber bundles' [62]. Its intrathalamic position, as now known, was a 'hole', a 'terra incognita' explaining many unfounded subdivisions and discrepancies. The first arguments in favour of the nigrothalamic connection came from the use of derivatives of the Nauta technique. [74] was that 'the most striking and consistent finding is a dense projection' to the thalamus. Later works in monkeys [63,64,67,69,226], based on the same, imperfect technique, confirmed the connection but could not observe much more than the ventral entry of the axons into the thalamus and the ventral part of the territory. The location of the territory within the lateral region ventrally and then around the mamillothalamic tract was then described [67,69,74] while the extent of the territory was restricted to its most posterior portion in another work [169]. The full topography of the nigral territory and the fact that it is a major subcortical afferent territory in the motor thalamus was only revealed by autoradiographic studies [66,151,153]. The amygdalothalamic connection to the lateral region could come from the basal complex of the amygdala. This is evident in the round fascicles piercing the nigral thalamus, which are densely labelled. The nigrothalamic connection in the lateral region has been examined at electron microscope level [154,157,192]. The fine connectivity of the two subregions receiving input from the two sources of the basal ganglia is quite different from that of other thalamic nuclei as there are no glomeruli and very few triads [157]. Matelli and Luppino [220] found no organisation of the thalamocortical connection. She noted that this thalamic part contrasted with the lateral part as it was 'very poor in fibers', i.e., on myeloarchitectonic crite- ria. The nucleus was characterized on cytoarchitectonic criteria by Friedemann [111] who first noticed its magno- cellular aspect with darkly stained neurons near the 'Vicq d'Azyr bundle' or mamillothalamic tract. According to the first clear demonstration of the ni- grothalamic connection [74], nigral axons ended in the 'VLm' and 'VAmc' nuclei of Olszewski [261]. The topo- graphic coincidence of the center of the nigral territory with the region having the largest and most intensively stained neurons (the so-called VA 'pars magnocellularis', VAmc, LRmc), easily recognisable by its topography sur- rounding the mamillothalamic tract, is obvious. It is a hilar part with numer- ous axons entering the thalamus and only very few neu- rons, apparently not very different from the more dorsally located neurons (see level IV of our atlas). With autoradiography, the Ilinskys [153] concluded that 'in pri- mates VM does not represent the principal thalamic site receiving nigral afferents'. This nucleus was in fact a part of a so-called 'ventral medial complex' which is known today to be an heterogeneous ensemble since it also includes the gustatory thalamus. 18) showing the crescent shape of the territory explain why the thalamic part that is extended in the ventromedial part of the lateral region in front of the central complex is in fact the mere posteromedial continua- tion of the nigral territory. The nigral territory also extends over the most anterior, polar, part of the lateral region, which raises the problems of the polar region of the thalamus and of the concept of 'ventral anterior nucleus'. The polar site is pierced by numerous thick thalamocortical myelinated bundles, which blur cytoarchitectonic traits (see levels I and II of the atlas). The nigral territory in other thalamic regions 16.4.1. The non-thalamic nigral targets The nigrostriatal and nigrotectal connections will not be discussed here (for the first see [131]). / Brain Research Reviews 22 (1996) 93-181 153 thalamus, neurons from nigral parts other than the pars compacta send their axons to the superior colliculus [33,74,106,144,162] and to the pedunculo-pontine complex [31,32,253]. In the squirrel monkey, 60% of the nigral neurons projecting to the thalamus gave collaterals to the pedunculo-pontine complex and only about 20% to the superior colliculus [265]. Thalamocortical connections There are only few data in the literature concerning the efferent cortical connections of the thalamic part that receives nigral information. In monkeys [271,367,368,370] and humans [298] it was found that neurons of the rostral part of the thalamus were unchanged after large cortical ablations. Carmel [60] concluded that ""the VA nucleus does not project upon the cortex in a manner similar to that of the other specific thalamic nuclei"", which has been a lasting belief that appears to be false. The cerebellar and pallidal thalamus have common cortical targets only with different 'weights' (see subsec- tions II 3.6 and III 3.6). The thalamic part receiving nigral axons also sends axons to the 'supplementary eye field' [334]. The thalamic neurons located within the pallidal territory send their axons to the sensori- motor territory (see preceding part III). Passingham [269] showed that a bilateral destruction, apparently re- specting the mammillothalamic tract, made monkeys un- able to learn a motor task. Complete separation of the three motor territories in the macaque motor thalamus The rudimentary cerebral cartography of his time led Mehler [226] to think that the nigral territory partially overlapped with the cerebellar and pallidal territories. Carpenter and Strominger [63] were the first to note that 'thalamic projections of the substantia nigra and globus pallidus are distinctive and do not overlap'. Most orally ('slice' I), the macaque's thalamus is made up of the nigral thalamus medially and the pallidal thalamus laterally. First it is important to point out that there is no thalamic subdivision devoid of after- ents rostral to the pallidal and nigral territories. There are dendrodendritic synapses between local circuit neurons in the cerebellar thalamus only in primates [156]. The separation between the two basal ganglia territo- ties, pallidal and nigral, could be a specific trait of primate thalamus organisation. [155] insisted that 'there is a considerable overlap between the terminal zones of pallidal and nigral afferents in the thalamus' in the cat. Contrary to what is commonly pro- posed, with respect to its thalamic projection, the entope- doncular nucleus would be the equivalent of a separate lateral (intrapeduncular) part of the substantia nigra. The medial nucleus of the pallidum and its specific thalamic territory in the lateral region would then be a primate innovation. [151] insisted that the separation of the two 'basal ganglia territories' signifi- cantly modifies thalamocortical connections between pri- mate and non-primate species: 'the segregation of the basal ganglia output systems at both thalamic and cortical levels is an important evolutionary specialization of the primate species'. This should be kept in mind when making inter- specific homologies, all the more so since the importance of the pallidothalamic connection in the pathophysiology of movement disorders is emerging [281]. The lack of separation between the pallidal and nigral territories in non-primate species could explain the diffi- culty of the 'VA-VL' system to fit with primate thalamic anatomy and the better adequacy of the Vogt system. Comparisons between macaques and man and in- traorder validity of the data Direct data on the topography of afferent territories of the human thalamus are available only in particular condi- tions, in embryos for instance [338,342]. For the time being, the situation in human thalamus and its new plan must rely on experimental data obtained in simians. When the human is compared to the simian motor thalamus, the cerebellar terrritory appears to be very simi- lar, even more differentiated in human. A noticeable topographical modification in primate thalamic evolution is obvious. From our data, we agree with Jones [138,171] that thalamic subdivisions in macaques can be rather confi- dently transferred to the human thalamus. work on lemurians or New World Cebidae, the validity of our thalamic parcellation, starting from macaques, would only cover primates, from Cercopithecidae (see [73,75,243]) to contemporary man. Middle row: viewed from the front, four consecutive transverse 'slices' of left thalamus from one monkey show the sequential organisation of the motor territories from front (I) to back (IV). Three artificial vertical ""reslicings' of left thalamus at 45to the mid-sagittal plane. A proposed parcellation of the lateral region of the primate thalamus 19.1. There are thus prethalamothala- mothalamic chains that have been recently analysed using transsynaptic transport [142,262,375]. Separation of the three 'motor' territories is a major feature of primate thalamic anatomy. It thus represents the gustatory thalamus isolated as the 'subregio Lateralis Arcuata' or 'nucleus lateralis arcuatus' (LArc) 19.1.2. Cerebellar nuclei The axons of neurons of the cerebellar nuclei form the brachium conjunctivum, the ascending part of which, the brachium conjunctivum ascendens, constitutes the cerebel- lothalamic tract. Pallidum medial nucleus The axons of neurons of the medial nucleus of the pallidum form the pallidothalamic tract with successive parts: the ansa lenticularis, a 'combed' part through the internal capsule, and the three 'fields of forel', H2, H and HI. The pallidothalamic tract end in the nucleus lateralis oralis (LO). Substantia nigra pars reticulata and lateralis The axons of neurons of the pars reticulata and lateralis of the substantia nigra, or locus niger, do not constitute a dense tract except just under the thalamus. of prethalamothalamocortical chains The different territories act as stations from prethalamic centers bringing specific 'modalities' to determined parts 19.2.5. Vestibular nuclei Axons from the vestibular nuclei constitutes the vestibu- lothalamic tract. Precentral motor cortex The precentral motor cortex (Mo) receives the majority of its thalamic information from LIL, i.e., from the cere- bellum. If the average Macaca mulatta is 'shrunk' using the relation between the mean 1CA-CP of the two species (M. mulatta 11.3 and M. fascicularis or irus 10, five which means a reduction of 7%) a thalamus of M. fascicularis may be obtained from that of the M. mulatta (see 1.3.2.d). Pre-SMA The thalamic afferentation of 'pre-SMA' is not known for sure yet. Stereotactic atlas of the motor thalamus 20.1. Introduction and ualidity of the atlas Significant modifications of the intrathalamic bound- aries appeared after studying the topography of the three motor territories (cerebellar, pallidal and nigral, in parts II, III and IV). The atlas is incomplete, as it does not show the whole anteroposterior extent of the thalamus, nor even that of the lateral region. Some correspon- dences thus have a fair legitimacyHowever, we would like to stress two pointsOur parcellation was not based on cytoarchitectonic criteria primarily, but on the topography of afferent territories and thalamocortical source spaces. The perithalamus (PTh) appears very thick as it is cut obliquely. At this level, significant variation in the position of the mamil- lothalamic tract may exist. 7 mm) This level, grossly corresponds to X of Olszewski (CP + 7.8 mm) already with the mamillothalamic tract (his 'TMT'). The limits of the nigral territory (LR) are far from corresponding to the cytoarchitectonic 'mag- nocellular nucleus' (VAmc), delineated by large dots, that surrounds here the mamillothalamic tractThe double ar- row indicates that LR includes both medial magnocellular and lateral parts. The pallidal part corresponds to the massive entry of the pallidothalamic tract H1. The pallidal thalamus (LO) is still made up of typical 'islands' (two of which are shown by short arrows). A spacing strip (between the arrows) separates the cerebellar from the pallidal thalamus. This level shows the cerebellar thalamus (LIL + LIM) in its whole lateromedial extension. A spacing strip still separates the cerebellar thalamus from the pallidal thalamus (LO) where two typical 'islands' are shown, the lower indicated by a short arrow. The cerebellar thalamus (LIL + LIM) is located dorsal to the lemniscal thalamus. There is a sort of 'rotation' of thalamic organisation. The end of the pallidal thalamus (LO) does not correspond to any cytoar- chitectonic differentiation. At this level the posterior region (or pulvinar, here PuOD, Olszewski's LP) appears, breaking the cere- bellar thalamus into dorsolateral (LIM) and paralaminar (plI) parts. The thin caudalmost transversal band extended as a 'cap' over the two lemniscal nuclei (LCL and LCM), probably corre- sponding to Kaas and colleagues's 'VPS', in our data receives cerebellar (and spinothalamic) islands.

Lesion and injection sites in the cerebellum ................................................. 117 7.2. Pallidal injection sites ............................................................ 131 11.2. Three Macaca, two Macaca fascicularis (MI 32, MI 44 D) and one Macaca mulatta (MM 22) received intracerebellar injections of mixed [3H]leucine and [3 H]proline. The experimental study of the pallidal territory was based on the results of injections in seven adult macaques of both sexes. Five Macaca fascicularis (MI27, MI28, MI30, MI33, MI40) received pallidal injections of tritiated tracers. Two Macaca mulatta (MM21D and MM22D) received pallidal injections of WGA-HRP. The data from three macaques that received intrathalamic injections (MI24, MI36 and MS16) already used in previous works from the laboratory [96,106] were reanalysed. The cartography of the nigral territory was drawn from 11 macaques: five Macaca fascicularis (MI22, MI27, MI31, MI35, MI41) and one Macaca mulatta (MM18) received nigral injections of tritiated tracers. Four Macaca mulatta (MM19, MM21, MM22G, MM23G) and one Macaca fascicularis (MI43) received nigral injections of WGA-HRP. MM27 received one injection of Biocytin and one of WGA-HRP. Intrastriatal injections were performed on four macaques: three Macaca fascicularis and one Macaca arctoides. All other monkeys received stereotactic injections. The markers and the injected quantities were as follows. The volume of the cerebellar injections within the cerebellar nuclei was 0.3 or 0.4 ~1 of mixed [3H]leucine and -proline. The volumes of the pallidal injections were 0.3 or 0.4 ~zl of mixed [3H]leucine and -proline and 0.3 p~l of WGA-HRP. The volume of the thalamic injection ranged from 0.2 to 0.6 ~1 of WGA-HRP as a 10% solution in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) 0.01 M; pH 7.4. The volume of the nigral injections was of 0, 3 or 0.4 ~1 of mixed [3H]leucine and -proline or ranged from 0.2 to 0.6 ~1 of WGA-HRP as a 10% solution in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) 0.01 M; pH 7.4. The duration of each injection was 10-20 min. After each injection, the canula was left in place for a further 10-15 min. Our cerebellar injections were made in relation to another ventricular system of coordinates visualized by ventriculography relying on the fastigial point F located at the top of the 4th ventricle [1,293]. The location in the brain was each time verified after the intracerebral trajectory and before any injection. Lower part: the Cartesian system of ventricular coordinates used for stereotaxic placements of injections and for cartography of the thalamus. Lesion and injection sites in the cerebellum The lesion sites involved the whole posterior part of the cerebellum, the cerebellar nuclei and the white matter leaving only an anterior wall of cerebellar cortex (see [276], Fig. The injection site in MI32 and MI44, located in the hilum of the dentate nucleus, involved the totality of the dentate and interposed nuclei and the lateral part of the fastigial nu- cleus. The injection site of MM 22 was essentially located within the fastigial nucleus bilaterally. Intrathalamic topography The intrathalamic distribution of the cerebellar axonal endings was identical in the lesioned and the injected monkeys. Source of the cerebellothalamic connection One retrograde study showed that the source of cerebel- lothalamic axons was located in all cerebellar nuclei [353] even though only the dentate and interposed nuclei were transsynaptically labelled after cortical injections [262,375]. Some injections of [24,110,177] were restricted to the interposed nuclei. Some injections [25,26,31,181,183] were restricted to the fastigial nucleus. The projection to the supplementary motor cortex, found by many authors [81,164,232,318,376], was recently denied and attributed to the concomittent injection of 'pre-SMA', frontal eye fled and supplementary motor eye field [334]. In this place labelled islands were observed [119] retrogradelly after area 4 injections (vertical hatching). 10L of [329] showed labelled islands of neurons in the same place after area 5 injections. [239] made injections and observed a projection to 4 and 3a. Most experimental data have been drawn from observations after lesion of the substantia nigra region and the dopaminergic nigrostriatal tract, with or without injection of harmaline [121,198,296]. Pallidal injection sites Pallidal injections of anterograde tracers all extended over a large pallidal volume. In MI27 and MI31, the injection filled the anterior two thirds and, in MI33, the posterior two thirds of the pallidum. In MI 28, the injection was almost complete. In all cases, there was some injection of the internal capsule and of the medial part of the lateral pallidum. Vertical hatching injection site (see also Figs. Track of injection in levels + 6.5 to + 7.3 with most medial position at level CP + 7. Vertical hatching injection site (see also Figs9 and 11). Source of the pallidothalamic axons The extent of the three intrathalamic injections of a retrograde tracer included all the thalamic regions receiv- ing axons from the pallidum. Vertical hatching injection site (see also Figs. These are furnished with pallidal inputs by several modestly branched axons observed after PHA-L injection 'forming rather dense terminal plexuses'. 16 and 17 had an almost complete injection with only a small anterior and ventral non-injected portion. Due to the rather large injections, the topography of the territory was identical to that of dorsal injections (MI43 and MI35) and also lateral (MM18) or antero-medial (MM21) injections. Source of the nigrothalamic axons In the two cases where injections of WGA-HRP were placed in the thalamic territory, the cell bodies of project- ing neurons were found, as already shown [106], in the pars reticulata and mixta (located above the pars com- pacta) and not in the pars lateralis. Vertical hatching injection site (see also Figs. Vertical hatching injection site (see also Figs. The oblique, transcapsular, trajectory of the injection needle is shown hatched diagonally. The site of injection is shown by vertical hatching. Interrupted lines indicate labelled fibersVertical hatching injection site (see also Figs. The ending in the pedunculopontine complex is not shown as it was too close to the massive injection (vertical hatching). 16 as the extent of the injection was too close to the complex. After large injections into the amygdala, in three mon- keys, we observed a projection of amygdalar axons in the medial and ventral part of the nigral territory. In monkey MS16, which received an injection of HRP in the nigral territory [106], there were labelled neurons in the substantia nigra and in the amygdala. Few fibers were labelled after Biocytin injection into the amyg- dala in MM27.",,,

For exampIe, following injections of tritiated amino acids in macaque prefrontal cortex, Goldman ('79) found label in the contralateral Accepted August 14, 1986. Nonetheless, following unilateral injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in macaque prefrontal cortex we have observed labeled thalamic cells that, although lying close to the midline, are clearly located in the contralateral thalamus. MATERIALS AND METHODS Our conclusions are based on findings obtained in four macaque monkeys with implants of HRP pellets in the prefrontal cortex. Case 1 was an adult, female, crab-eating (cynomolgus) macaque (Macaca fascicularis). Cases 2 and 3 were adult, male, crab-eating macaques. Case 4 was a 6- month-old infant, male, rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta). Case 4 was a 6- month-old infant, male, rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta). The frontal areas included in the injection sites were determined by comparison to the macaque cytoarchitectonic map of Walker ('40). Labeled thalamic nuclei were named according to the macaque atlas of Olszewski ('52). Injection sites in the frontal cortex of four macaque monkeys obtained with slow-release HRP pellets. Because modern investigators often recognize IAM in primates and nonprimates (e.g., Paxinos and Watson, 82; Veazey et al., 82), although 01- szewskis macaque atlas is still widely used, it is worth pointing out that densocellular AM and IAM are probably not identical structures. DISCUSSION The main goals of the present investigation were to determine the extent to which the pattern of ipsilateral and contralateral prefrontothalamic projections differ, and to determine whether there exists a crossed thalamoprefrontal projection in the macaque. Our results indicate that whereas macaque prefrontal cortex has strong bilateral projections to certain thalamic nuclei, such as AM, MDmc, and the midline nuclei, other nuclei that receive strong uncrossed projections are the targets of rather weak crossed projections (MDpc, VAmc), or, as far as we can determine, receive no crossed projections at all (Ret, PM). The very dense projection to contralateral MDmc observed in Case 2 may arise from the orbital cortex, as both Goldman ('79) and Akert and Hartmann-von Monikow ('80) reported dense projections to contralateral MDmc in macaques with injections of radioactive tracer confined to this region. For example, Kunzle ('76), using the autoradiographic technique in macaques, found that the projections of the precentral motor cortex to Ret and to the thalamic motor nuclei (VL and the oral part of the ventral posterior nucleus) were strictly ipsilateral, while projections to lateral MD and the intralaminar nuclear group were bilateral. ('85) observed bilateral retrograde labeling of Cdc and the central medial nucleus (CeM) with fluorescent dye injections in macaque prefrontal cortex (CeM probably corresponds to Cif in Olszewski's nomenclature). However, the crossed projections originating from these nuclei may not terminate exclusively in the prefrontal region, as Cavada and Goldman-Rakic (unpublished observation) have observed labeled cells in the contralateral AM following injections of WGA-HRP in macaque posterior parietal cortex. There is also behavioral evidence indicating a mnemonic role for the mesial thalamus, as pathology of this region is characteristic of individuals with Korsakoffs amnesic syndrome (Victor et al., '71) and experimental lesions of the mesial thalamus in macaques yield memory deficits (Aggleton and Mishkin, '83; Isseroff et al., '82).

ABSTRACT We have conducted a systematic comparison of the ipsilateral (uncrossed) and contralateral (crossed) thalamic connections of prefrontal cortex in macaque monkeys, using cortical implants of horseradish peroxidase pellets and tetramethyl benzidine histochemistry to demonstrate anterograde and retrograde thalamic labeling. Contrary to the prevailing belief that thalamocortical projections are entirely uncrossed, our findings indicate that a modest crossed projection to prefrontal cortex arises from the mesial thalamus, principally the anteromedial and midline nuclei. Also, while confirming that corticothalamic projections are bilateral, we found that the pattern of crossed projections differs from that of uncrossed projections. Projections to mesial thalamic nuclei, specifically to the anteromedial nucleus, the midline nuclei, and the magnocellular part of the mediodorsal nucleus are bilateral, the contralateral projection being nearly as dense as the ipsilateral projection. These results indicate that prefrontal cortex has prominent bilateral and reciprocal connections with the nuclei of the mesial thalamic region. Key words: mediodorsal nucleus, anterior nuclei, midline nuclei, nonspecific thalamus, primate cortex Functional interpretations of the relationship between the thalamus and cortex in mammals typically emphasize the ipsilateral (uncrossed) and reciprocal organization of thalamocortical and corticothalamic projections (e.g., Eccles, '84; Jones, '81; Steriade and Deschenes, '84). A full account of forebrain organization, however, must also consider the role of contralateral (crossed) connections between the cortex and thalamus. Anatomical studies have clearly demonstrated crossed corticothalamic projections in primates (Akert and Hartmann-von Monikow, '80; Akert et al., '79; Arikuni et al., '83; Campos-Ortega and Cluver, '69; DeVito, '69; Goldman, '79; Jurgens, '76; Kiinzle, '76, '78; Kuypers and Lawrence, '67; Wiesendanger and Wiesendanger, '85) as well as in carnivores and rodents (literature reviewed by Molinari et al., '85). While commonly reported, crossed corticothalamic projections have nevertheless received little systematic investigation, and their anatomical distribution and contribution to forebrain function are poorly understood. Current evidence suggests that the ipsilateral and contralateral corticothalamic projections are organized somewhat differently. Whereas bilateral corticothalamic projections are now well established, modern studies have affirmed with virtual unanimity the strictly ipsilateral organization of thalamic projections to the cortex. Nonetheless, following unilateral injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in macaque prefrontal cortex we have observed labeled thalamic cells that, although lying close to the midline, are clearly located in the contralateral thalamus. Our observations are consistent with recent incidental reports of crossed projections from midline thalamic nuclei to motor cortex (Jurgens, '82) and prefrontal cortex (Asanuma et al., '85) in primates. The first was to establish with greater certainty the nature of the difference between the crossed and uncrossed projections to the thalamus arising from primate prefrontal cortex. The second was to document the existence of a bilateral thalamocortical projection. In order to label as nearly as possible all the afferent and efferent thalamic connections of prefrontal cortex, we used cortical implants of acrylamide-gel pellets containing HRP and reacted the tissue with the tetramethyl benzidine (TMB) chromagen. Acrylamidegel pellets produce slow and continual release of HRP and enhanced anterograde and retrograde transport of the enzyme (Griffin et al., '79; Leichnetz, '82), while TMB (Mesulam, '78, '82) dramatically improves the resolution of transported HRP compared to the diaminobenzidine (DAB) chromagen used in many of the published studies of thalamocortical projections. At least one section in every twelve through the frontal lGbe and one section in ten through the thalamus was treated. Sets of adjacent, unreacted sections were stained with thionin or cresyl violet for cytoarchitectonic evaluation of thalamic labeling. Labeled thalamic nuclei were named according to the macaque atlas of Olszewski ('52). For purposes of description, the thalamic reticular nucleus and habenula will be considered together with the dorsal thalamus, although they are derived from the subthalamus and epithalamus, respectively. Also, we will use the term ""nonspecific"" to refer to the midline and intralaminar thalamic nuclei, and ""specific"" to refer to the sensory, motor, and associational nuclei. In any event, the absence of retrograde label in the mediodorsal nucleus of the contralateral thalamus indicates that HRP was not transported from this region.

In addition, the pattern of thalamic labeling in the ipsilateral thalamic nuclei was largely consistent with that found in previous studies of primate prefrontothalamic connectivity (see Discussion). The thalamic reticular nucleus (Ret) was always well labeled anterogradely, but contained no labeled cells. Also, anterograde label was found in an epithalamic structure, the lateral habenula (HL).

In the other three cases, MDmc labeling was markedly weaker in the contralateral than in the ipsilateral thalamus, but was still very prominent. The AM nucleus was also a major target of crossed prefrontothalamic projections. Low-power darkfield photomicrographs of thalamic labeling in Case 2. In this case, the plane of section was slightly oblique and passed through the left thalamus more rostrally than through the right thalamus. A: In the left thalamus, ipsilateral to the injection, anterograde label is dense in both MDpc and MDmc. By contrast, it appears that few if any crossed prefrontothalamic fibers travel in the large commissures of the forebrain, as we observed no labeled fibers descending from the corpus callosum in the internal capsule contralateral to the injection or in the anterior commissure. Caudal to the interthalamic adhesion, where the third ventricle broadens, anterograde label in ipsilateral HL, MD, and H appeared to be continuous with label in the dorsal part of the habenulopeduncular tract (Fig. Thus, it is possible that cortical fibers entered the ipsilateral thalamus and epithalamus through the mesencephalon via the habenulopeduncular tract. Projections to the contralateral thalamus and epithalamus may follow a similar course, as we observed very light labeling of the contralateral habenulopeduncular tract, HL, and posterior MD. Retmgrade labeling of the contralateral thalamus. Our results clearly indicate the existence of a crossed thalamocortical projection. In contrast to anterograde labeling, cell labeling in the contralateral thalamus was much more restricted: labeled cells were found primarily in the mesial part of AM and in the midline nuclei. Although it was not always possible to determine whether a particular labeled neuron in the medial thalamus was ipsilateral or contralateral, because the location of the midline could not always be accurately determined, labeled cells were commonly found in association with paired foci of anterograde labeling centered on the midline (Figs. The region of AM labeled in the contralateral thalamus corresponds, at least in part, to the densocellular AM subnucleus of Olszewski (52). AM, meaning that the densocellular subnuclei of each thalamus are fused at the midline to create an unpaired structure. Further, the distribution of labeled cells in the contralateral AM was restricted in the mediolateral and anteroposterior dimensions compared to ipsilateral labeling: Whereas labeled cells in the contralatera1 AM were located in the most medial part of the nucleus, they occurred throughout the mediolateral extent of The densocellular subnucleus of AM recognized by Olszewski (52), and the interanteromedial nucleus (IAM) recognized by others in primates (Crouch, 34; Walker, 38) and nonprimate mammals (Ariens Kappers et al., 36; Crosby et al., 62), have each been described as a cell band that is continuous across the midline and interconnects the AM nuclei of the two thalami. Since we observed approximately 15 cells per section in the densely labeled region of contralatera1 AM, and we saved and reacted every tenth section through the thalamus, we estimate that there were typically several hundred cells in contralateral AM that projected to any given area of prefrontal cortex injected in this study. Again, labeled cells were less numerous in the midline nuclei of the contralateral thalamus than in the ipsilateral midline nuclei. We considered the possibility that the anterograde and retrograde labeling of the contralateral thalamus was artifactual. In three of the four cases, however, HRP was clearly limited to the injected hemisphere; in the one instance (Case 3) in which HRP may have spread to the opposite hemisphere, there was no evidence of subsequent transport to the thalamus. Such labeling was never observed: in Case 3, as in the other cases, labeled cells in the contralateral thalamus were almost entirely restricted to the AM and midline nuclei. A second possible source of false-positive results is that the contralateral thalamus might have been labeled by transneuronal transport over a number of potential pathways (these pathways are discussed in detail by Goldman, '79, and Molinari et a1.,'85). Finally, the fact that some cells observed in the contralateral thalamus were very well filled with reaction product (Figs. DISCUSSION The main goals of the present investigation were to determine the extent to which the pattern of ipsilateral and contralateral prefrontothalamic projections differ, and to determine whether there exists a crossed thalamoprefrontal projection in the macaque. Our results indicate that whereas macaque prefrontal cortex has strong bilateral projections to certain thalamic nuclei, such as AM, MDmc, and the midline nuclei, other nuclei that receive strong uncrossed projections are the targets of rather weak crossed projections (MDpc, VAmc), or, as far as we can determine, receive no crossed projections at all (Ret, PM). An important finding is the crossed thalamoprefrontal projection that arises mainly from the AM and midline nuclei. Ipsilateral thalamic labeling The observed pattern of retrograde and anterograde labeling of the thalamus ipsilateral to the injection is largely consistent with previous investigations of the thalamic connectivity of prefrontal cortex in primates (thalamocortical projections: Asanuma et al., '85; Goldman-Rakic and Porrino, '86; Jacobson et al., '78; Kievit and Kuypers, '77; corticothalamic projections: Jacobson et al., '78; Kiinzle, '78). In addition, we observed weak anterograde labeling of the lateral habenular nucleus, an epithalamic structure. Crossed corticothalamic projections The projections of prefrontal cortex to the contralateral thalamus appear to be more widespread than indicated by previous investigations. Further, we suggest that the strongest prefrontal projection to contralateral AM may originate from the cortex ventral to the principal sulcus, as this region was involved in both animals (Cases 2 and 4) that exhibited very heavy anterograde labeling of AM Differences between thalamic nuclei in the laterality of corticothalamic projections It is significant that in every case examined, we observed marked variation in the laterality of prefrontal projections to different thalamic nuclei, ranging from strong ipsilateral dominance to bilaterality. Evidence from studies of motor and premotor cortex indicate that the projections of these regions to thalamic nuclei also exhibit differences in laterality. For example, Kunzle ('76), using the autoradiographic technique in macaques, found that the projections of the precentral motor cortex to Ret and to the thalamic motor nuclei (VL and the oral part of the ventral posterior nucleus) were strictly ipsilateral, while projections to lateral MD and the intralaminar nuclear group were bilateral. Other studies of primates (Akert and Hartmann-von Monikow, '80; Akert et al., '79; Campos-Ortega and Cluver, '69; DeVito, '69; Kunzle, '78; Kuypers and Lawrence, '67; Wiesendanger and Wiesendanger, '85) and carnivores (Molinari et al., '85; Sakai and Tanaka, '83, '84) have yielded similar results, confirming that projections of the motor and premotor cortex to the intralaminar nuclei, particularly the CM-Pf complex, are bilateral, while projections to the thalamic motor relay nuclei are almost exclusively ipsilateral. In general, therefore, it appears that the so-called nonspecific thalamic nuclei-that is, the intralaminar and midline nuclei-are prominent targets of bilateral projections from frontal cortex. Further, there are evidently regional differences in the crossed projections to the nonspecific thalamus: motor and premotor cortex project primarily to the intralaminar nuclei while prefrontal cortex projects mainly to the midline nuclei. On the other hand, projections to the ""specific"" thalamic nuclei, with the exceptions of AM and MDmc, exhibit a very strong ipsilateral dominance. Variation in the laterality of corticothalamic projections may be related to the different morphological types of corticothalamic fibers described by Scheibel and Scheibel('66, '67, '70). Using the Golgi method, they observed that cortical fibers which terminate in the nonspecific thalamic nuclei are of small caliber and have sparse terminal fields which extend over several nuclei; significantly, axon collaterals cross the massa intermedia into contralateral nonspecific nuclei. Accordingly, we suggest that the asymmetry of corticothalamic projections observed in anterograde tracing studies may reflect the differential distribution of two types of corticothalamic fibers, large-caliber fibers with dense, restricted terminations being distributed primarily to the specific nuclei of the ipsilateral thalamus, while small-caliber fibers with sparse but widespread terminations are distributed predominantly to the nonspecific nuclei of both thalami. Crossed thalamocortical projections The present study provides evidence for a modest crossed projection to the prefrontal cortex from the mesial portion of AM and from the midline nuclei and is the first study to present detailed documentation of crossed thalamocortical projections. Previous investigations of the thalamic projections to primate prefrontal cortex with HRP did not demonstrate a crossed projection (Jacobson et al., '78; Kievit and Kuypers, '77; Goldman-Rakic and Porrino, '86). Indeed the overwhelming majority of investigations of thalamocortical projections conducted with modern axon transport techniques, beginning with the HRP study of Jones and Leavitt ('74), have indicated that the mammalian thalamocortical projection is exclusively ipsilateral. To our knowledge, there are only three other explicit claims of crossed thalamocortical projections in the recent literature. ('85) injected WGA-HRP into rat motor cortex and noted that ""one or two labeled cells were occasionally observed in some sections in the contralateral thalamus."" These results would indicate that the crossed thalamocortical projection is essentially trivial. We can offer several reasons that significant retrograde labeling of the contralateral thalamus was found in this study, and almost without exception, not observed or reported in many other reports of thalamocortical connectivity. First, we used the TMB chromagen (as did Jurgens, '823, which greatly enhances sensitivity of retrograde (as well as anterograde) HRP tracing (Mesulam, '78, '82) compared to DAB, the chromagen used in most earlier studies of thalamocortical connectivity. Second, the prevailing conviction that thalamocortical projections are strictly ipsilateral, combined with the difficulty of determining precisely the location of the thalamic midline, might make workers reluctant to regard labeled cells that occur close to the midline as cells of the contralateral thalamus. For instance, Jones ('851, while noting that labeled cells are sometimes observed near the midline in the thalamus contralateral to 10969861, 1987, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.902570211 by Rwth Aachen Hochschulbibliothe, Wiley Online Library on [12/09/2023].

Finally, it may be the case that crossed thalamocortical projections have not been more commonly reported because they arise exclusively, or very nearly so, from only a few nuclei, particularly the AM and midline nuclei. Studies of cortical areas that do not have strong connections with these nuclei, such as the sensory areas, would then be expected to demonstrate only ipsilateral thalamocortical projections. (These observations, made with much smaller injections of tracer than those of the present study, also indicate that large injections are not required to demonstrate crossed thalamocortical projections.) Nevertheless, we believe that projections from the thalamus to the contralateral cortex are not common features of thalamic organization, but arise only from nuclei that lie close to the midline (i.e., the mesial thalamic region). We suggest that the development of crossed thalamocortical fibers may depend on the fusion of the thalami during gestation, the mama intermedia providing a substrate for the decussation of outgrowing axon collaterals. Pathways of crossed projections There are several possible pathways for decussating corticothalamic fibers. We found that labeled fibers were continuous across the midline in the mama intermedia (interthalamic adhesion) in agreement with several other studies of crossed corticothalamic connectivity (Campos-Ortega and Cluver, '69; Kiinzle, '76, '78; Molinari et al., '85; Sakai and Tanaka, '84; Scheibel and Scheibel, '66, '67, '70). These earlier workers evidently believed that the massa intermedia consists largely of crossed thalamothalamic fibers. It is now clear, however, that corticothalamic fibers are an important component of the massa intermedia. Uncrossed and crossed corticofugal fibers may enter the thalamus ventrally, through the hypothalamus, subthalamus, and mesencephalon, as described in primates by workers using silver-degeneration techniques (CamposOrtega and Cluver, '69; DeVito, '69; Kuypers and Lawrence, '67). Fibers may cross the midline just ventral to the third ventricle at caudal thalamic levels (Campos-Ortega and Cluver, '69; Kuypers and Lawrence, '67), or possibly in the posterior commissure, which contained labeled fibers in our cases. The corpus callosum and anterior commisure have also been suggested as pathways for crossing corticothalamic fibers (Rinvik, '68, '72). ('85) have reported that sectioning the corpus callosum in rats results in no apparent diminution of anterograde labeling of the contralateral thalamus following cortical HRP injections. They argue that most, if not all, crossed corticothalamic fibers decussate in the mass intermedia. Possible functional significance of bilateral thalamic connectivity The functions of the crossed connections between the cortex and thalamus, consisting mostly of corticothalamic projections, are unknown. We suggest that the crossed connections between the cortex and thalamus described here may constitute part of this integrative system. An integrative role is consistent with the observation that the nonspecific (intralaminar and midline) thalamic nuclei, which we have shown are prominent targets of bilateral projections from frontal cortex, are involved in mechanisms of cortical activation and arousal (Brodal, '81; Steriade and Deschenes, '84). The crossed thalamic connections of the prefrontal cortex may have an additional, mnemonic, function. It may be particularly significant, in view of our results, that the hippocampal formation projects bilaterally to the AM and rostra1 midline nuclei, while its projections to other thalamic nuclei are almost exclusively ipsilateral (Aggleton et al., '86). There is also behavioral evidence indicating a mnemonic role for the mesial thalamus, as pathology of this region is characteristic of individuals with Korsakoffs amnesic syndrome (Victor et al., '71) and experimental lesions of the mesial thalamus in macaques yield memory deficits (Aggleton and Mishkin, '83; Isseroff et al., '82). GOLDMAN-RAKIC amnesia can result from interruption of the mammillothalamic tract, thereby disconnecting the anterior thalamic nuclei from the mammillary bodies (Cramon et al., '85).

Nonetheless, following unilateral injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) in macaque prefrontal cortex we have observed labeled thalamic cells that, although lying close to the midline, are clearly located in the contralateral thalamus. In Cases 1,2, and 3, a series of sections through the injection site was reacted with diaminobenzidine (DAB). The frontal areas included in the injection sites were determined by comparison to the macaque cytoarchitectonic map of Walker ('40). We considered the effective injection site to be the area of cortex in which the concentration of TMB reaction product was sufficient to render the cortex opaque or black under brightfield illumination, obscuring labeled axons and perikarya (Mesulam, '82). Estimated injection sites obtained with this criterion were more conservative than those obtained with DAB, the dense TMB zone being considerably larger than the region which contained the core and halo of DAB reaction product. In Case 1, in which two pellets were placed in the ventral rim of the rostral principal sulcus, the injection site included rostral portions of the lateral, medial, and orbital cortex. In Case 2, with two pellets placed near the orbital margin, the injection site covered the lateral part of the orbital surface and much of the cortex ventral to the principal sulcus on the lateral surface. Four pellets were implanted at the dorsomedial margin of the frontal lobe in Case 3, and the injection site included the frontal pole, much of the cortex dorsal to the principal sulcus, and the medial cortex. The injection site included mainly the cortex within and surrounding the principal sulcus, although there was also some involvement of lateral orbital cortex. In Cases 1 and 3 the estimated injection sites included the rostral portions of cingulate cortex to varying degrees in addition to prefrontal cortex. In Case 3, in which pellets were placed mesially, the presence of a small amount of diffuse reaction product in the contralateral ventromedial cortex raised the possibility that HRP may have spread to the opposite hemisphere, although this observation is also consistent with anterograde transport from the injection site. In spite of differences in the location of injections, the distribution of labeled cells and fibers in the 10969861, 1987, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.902570211 by Rwth Aachen Hochschulbibliothe, Wiley Online Library on [12/09/2023]. The region of cortex containing dense tetramethyl benzidine (TMB) reaction product, which we regard as the effective injection site, is indicated by dark hatching. In Case 2, the injection site is centered in area 12 at the orbital marpin, but also involves ventral area 46 in and around the principal sulcus, as well as areas 11 and 13 on the orbital surface. The injection site for Case 3 covers virtually all of Walkers areas 9 and 10 along with portions of areas 46, 12, 11, 25, and 24. In Case 4, the injection site is centered on the principal sulcus (Walkers area 46), spreading into adjacent parts of areas 9,11, and 12. In this and all subsequent figures, the left side of the brain is ipsilateral to the cortical injection. A major result of this study is that in the hemisphere contralateral to the injection, anterograde label was found in 10969861, 1987, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.902570211 by Rwth Aachen Hochschulbibliothe, Wiley Online Library on [12/09/2023]. In all cases, contralateral MDmc was heavily labeled and MDpc lightly labeled even though both subdivisions of MD were very heavily labeled ipsilateral to the injection (Figs. 3A), although the densely labeled portion of MDmc was more restricted anteroposteriorly in the thalamus contralateral to the injection than ipsilaterally. A: In the left thalamus, ipsilateral to the injection, anterograde label is dense in both MDpc and MDmc. By contrast, it appears that few if any crossed prefrontothalamic fibers travel in the large commissures of the forebrain, as we observed no labeled fibers descending from the corpus callosum in the internal capsule contralateral to the injection or in the anterior commissure. Labeled cells are present on both sides of the midline, although they are more numerous ipsilateral to the injection. Since we observed approximately 15 cells per section in the densely labeled region of contralatera1 AM, and we saved and reacted every tenth section through the thalamus, we estimate that there were typically several hundred cells in contralateral AM that projected to any given area of prefrontal cortex injected in this study. First, HRP could have spread from the injection site to the contralateral hemisphere. In three of the four cases, however, HRP was clearly limited to the injected hemisphere; in the one instance (Case 3) in which HRP may have spread to the opposite hemisphere, there was no evidence of subsequent transport to the thalamus. Ipsilateral thalamic labeling The observed pattern of retrograde and anterograde labeling of the thalamus ipsilateral to the injection is largely consistent with previous investigations of the thalamic connectivity of prefrontal cortex in primates (thalamocortical projections: Asanuma et al., '85; Goldman-Rakic and Porrino, '86; Jacobson et al., '78; Kievit and Kuypers, '77; corticothalamic projections: Jacobson et al., '78; Kiinzle, '78). We attribute these differences to the superior sensitivity of the anterograde HRP tracing method used in this investigation compared to the autoradiographic and degeneration methods used in prior studies, and to the large size of our injections. The very dense projection to contralateral MDmc observed in Case 2 may arise from the orbital cortex, as both Goldman ('79) and Akert and Hartmann-von Monikow ('80) reported dense projections to contralateral MDmc in macaques with injections of radioactive tracer confined to this region. ('85) injected WGA-HRP into rat motor cortex and noted that ""one or two labeled cells were occasionally observed in some sections in the contralateral thalamus."" However, Jurgens ('82) noted bilateral retrograde labeling of Cif, Reu, and MD following injections of free HRP into squirrel monkey motor cortex, and Asanuma et al. ('85) observed bilateral retrograde labeling of Cdc and the central medial nucleus (CeM) with fluorescent dye injections in macaque prefrontal cortex (CeM probably corresponds to Cif in Olszewski's nomenclature).

However, the crossed projections originating from these nuclei may not terminate exclusively in the prefrontal region, as Cavada and Goldman-Rakic (unpublished observation) have observed labeled cells in the contralateral AM following injections of WGA-HRP in macaque posterior parietal cortex. (These observations, made with much smaller injections of tracer than those of the present study, also indicate that large injections are not required to demonstrate crossed thalamocortical projections.) ('85) have reported that sectioning the corpus callosum in rats results in no apparent diminution of anterograde labeling of the contralateral thalamus following cortical HRP injections.",,,

Area 25 received thalamic input mainly from the midline parataenial (Pt), central densocellular (Cdc), and reuniens nuclei as well as from the dorsal parvicellular division of the mediodorsal nucleus (MDpc). Areas 24a and 24b received most thalamic afferents from fusiform and multipolar cells in the Cdc and Pf nuclei with fewer from the ventral anterior (VA) and MDpc and MD densocellular (MDdc) nuclei and only minor input from AM. Areas 23a and 23b, in contrast, did not receive AV, AD, or LD input, but the greatest proportion of their thalamic afferents arose in AM. First, AM projected primarily to posterior cingulate areas with area 23 receiving its principal thalamic input from AM. 0 1987 ALAN R. LISY, INC. MONKEY CINGULATE CORTEX 257 In light of the extensive projections of Cdc, Csl, and Pf to anterior cingulate cortex, it is proposed that the midline and intralaminar thalamic nuclei be classified as part of limbic thalamus along with the anterior, LD, and MD nuclei. As such, AM is the only limbic thalamic nucleus that has such widespread projections to cingulate cortex. Finally, visually evoked activity in area 23 may be the result of projections from the LP and medial pulvinar Key words: anterior thalamic nuclei, midline thalamic nuclei, intralaminar thalamic nuclei, lateroposterior thalamic nucleus, pulvinar thalamic nucleus, primate Primate cingulate cortex is involved in attention and memory and mediates somatic and autonomic motor responses, phonation, and responses to painful sensation (Smith, '45; Ward, '48; Kaada, '51; Barris and Schuman, '53; Foltz and White, '62, '68; Dua and MacLean, '64; Talairach et al., '73; Watson et al., '73; Haller et al., '76). Definitions of the cingulate region have been based on topographical criteria (e.g., Kappers et aI., '67) or on connections with the anterior thalamic nuclei (Clark and Boggon, '33; Rose and Woolsey, '48). ('64) made lesions in area 23 in the monkey and did not observe retrograde changes in the anterior thalamic nuclei. Because areas 23, 30, and 29 are usually involved in experimental procedures, for example, those employing retrogradely transported tracers (e.g., Vogt et al., '79; Baleydier and Mauguiere, 'SO), the only thalamic projection reported to terminate specifically in area 23 is one that originates in the medial pulvinar (Baleydier and Mauguiere, '85). The strategy for this investigation was to make large and then restricted injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) into monkey cingulate cortex such that the distribution of thalamic afferents could be characterized in terms of a comprehensive cytoarchitectural analysis. Olszewski ('52) described in detail the cytoarchitecture of monkey thalamus. In light of thalamic projections from both the anterior and midline nuclei to cinguIate cortex, it is necessary to clarify structural distinctions between them. In this case most labeled neurons in the thalamus were in the ventral, midline, intralaminar, and mediodorsal nuclei. Anterior and midline thalamic nuclei at a level just caudal to the midline cronsing of AM. and the greatest density of labeled neurons was in the 7C-F) HRP-labeled neurons were in most of the same tha- anterior nuclei and along the dorsal thalamus (Fig. andor parts of area 23 indicated that there were selective An HRP injection that involved mainly area 25 (not preferences in the distribution of thalamic inputs to each shown) produced labeling of cells in Cdc, Pt, and throughout cytoarchitectural subdivision.

Three small injections into posteior cingulate cortex and the positions of labeled neurons in the thalamus. Limbic thalamus The present study demonstrates that the midline Cdc and intralaminar Pf and C1 nuclei are the principal sources of thalamic input to area 24. Though a minor projection from AM is present, this is not the main source of thalamic afferents, as is true for rodents and marsupials (Beckstead, '76; Benjamin and Golden,'85). In none of these latter studies is there evidence that AM is the predominant thalamic input to area 24. In light of their strong connections with cingulate cortex, it is proposed that the midline and intralaminar nuclei be classified as part of linibic thalamus. ('60) included LD in limbic thalamus of monkey because it has projections to the cingulate and parahippocampal cortices (see also Locke et al., '64; Locke and Kerr, '73). Thus, anterior thalamic inputs are characteristic of but not unique to the cingulate cortex. In light of these shared AM and MD as well as medial pulvinar thalamic inputs and extensive connections between area 46 of the prefrontal cortex and cinalate cortex (Nauta, '64; Pandya et al., '71, '81; Kunzle, '78; Vogt et al., '79; Baleydier and Maugiere, '80; GoldmanRakic et al., '84; Barbas and Mesulam, '85), it is likely that these two cortical regions are involved in similar functions such as delayed response performance (Niki and Watanbe, '79). Comparative organization of posterior cingulate cortex Connections with the AD and AV thalamic nuclei are generally considered to be a distinguishing trait of posterior cingulate cortex in the rat (Domesick, '721, rabbit (Rose and Woolsey, '481, and monkey (Vogt et al., '79; Baleydier and Mauguiere, '80). It also receives input mainly from the AM, LP, and medial pulvinar thalamic nuclei but does not appear to receive input from AD or AV. The main differences in thalamocortical connections among these species can be accounted for by the presence of area 23 connections in primates. Although area 23 does not receive direct afferents from the lateral geniculate nucleus, there are two other possible thalamic sources for this activity including the LP and medial pulvinar thalamic nuclei. In light of the extensive connections of LP and the medial pulvinar with the visual system, it is likely that visual-evoked activity in area 23 can be partially accounted for on the basis of activity in these two thalamic nuclei.

Small injections restricted to areas 23a, 23b, or 30 provide a basis for distinguishing among the connections of these areas and those of' area 29. MATERIALS AND METHODS Surgical procedures In all instances in which injections were made into cingulate cortex, the monkey was anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital and mounted in a stereotaxic instrument.

In a second series of five animals, very limited HRP injections were made with 0.015 pl of 5% HRP conjugated to wheat germ agglutinin (HRP-WGA, Sigma), and the brains were prepared according to the above protocol.

NORGREN Department of Behavioral Science, The Milton S. Hershey Medical Center, Hershey, Pennsylvania 17033 ABSTRACT The efferent projections of the parvicellular division of the ventroposteromedial nucleus of the thalamus (VMPpc; thalamic taste area) were traced to cortex in Macaca fmcicularis by using tritiated amino acid autoradiography. The autoradiographic data were verified by injecting each cortical projection area with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and observing the pattern of retrogradely labeled somata within the thalamus. Key words: thalamus, cortex, autoradiography, horseradish peroxidase Two areas of primate cortex have been implicated in taste sensation on the basis of their neural connectivity with either gustatory afferent nerves (Benjamin and Burton, '68; Benjamin et al., '68) or the thalamic taste area (Roberts and Akert, '63; Locke, '67; Benjamin and Burton, '68; Wirth, '73; Mufson and Mesulam, '84). In the present experiments, the thalamocortical projections of the gustatory system of Old World monkeys were studied by using amino acid autoradiography. METHODS Subjects Fourteen juvenile and adult cynomolgus monkeys (M. fmcicularis) ranging in weight from 1.5 to 7.0 kg received injections of tritiated leucine and/or proline (50-125 pCiIp1) in either the thalamic taste area (the parvicellular division of the ventroposteromedial nucleus; VPMpc), or the thalamic trigeminal somatosensory nucleus (VPM), or in adjacent nongustatory, nonlingual areas. Bilateral tritiated amino acid injections were made in two monkeys after it was determined that all thalamocortical projections under study were ipsilateral. Localization of thalamic and cortical gustatory areas Glass-insulated tungsten microelectrodes (Z = 0.5-1.0 MQ) were used to record single and multineuron activity within the thalamus and cortex. Gustatory (0.3 M NaCI, 0.3 M sucrose), thermal (cold, 18""C, and warm 38C distilled water), and somesthetic (cotton-tipped swabs and camelhair brush) stimulation of oral and perioral surfaces effectively drove neurons in the thalamus despite the depressive effects of general anesthesia. The thalamic taste area (VPMpc) in monkey is difficult to locate because of its small size and variation with respect to the skull along the anteroposterior axis (Wagman et al., '75). Each thalamic terminal plexus is described qualitatively as either light moderate or dense. Cytoarchitectonic identification of thalamic and cortical areas Subdivision of the posterior ventral nucleus into the VPL, VPM, and VPMpc was done by using Olszewskis (52) cytoarchitectonic descriptions of each area. (78) for the operculum and somatic sensory cortex were used to describe the distribution of the thalamic afferent plexus on cortex. Animals that received bilateral injections were given case numbers with the suffix R or L. In several of the experimental cases the autoradiographic injection spread beyond the ventrobasal thalamus into the CM. This thalamostriate projection has been described in detail by Powell and Cowan (67). These axons continued within the thalamic radiations dorsal to the putamen and claustrum. This thalamostriate projection was weak in this case, but more pronounced in others in which the injection sites involved ventral the CM to a greater degree. As with the contralateral injection, labeled axons were traced into the thalamic radiations and external capsule. Labeled axons coursed through the VPL and proceeded anterolaterally through the internal capsule and thalamic radiations toward the lateral convexity. Laminar distribution of the thalamic terminal plexus Although the efferent projections from the VPMpc and VPM spanned several cortical cytoarchitectonic fields, the laminar distribution of the terminal plexus in each area was confined to layers IV and IIIb. Figure 8 summarizes the distribution of the thalamic afferent plexus observed in four separate experiments following autoradiographic injections into the VPMpc and VPM. The cells of origin within the thalamus were located by injecting HRP into each cortical area revealed in the autoradiographic experiments: orbitofrorital cortex, frontal insular, and opercular cortices and the lateral margin of the precentral gyrus. Retrogradely labeled neurons were observed in several cortical and subcortical areas, but only cell labeling within the thalamus is discussed below. The densest part of each of four autoradiographic injection sites was drawn on a single projection drawing of the left thalamus. No topological relationship was found between the ventrobasal thalamus and the insular-opercular projection area. The pattern of retrograde cell labeling observed in the thalamus in these four cases is shown in Figure 10. DISCUSSION Neurons in the parvicellular division of the ventroposteromedial nucleus of the thalamus (VPMpc) respond to gustatory stimulation and project to two discontinuous areas of cortex adjacent to the sylvian fissure. Neurons in the thalamic trigeminal somatosensory relay, the VPM, project to primary somatic sensory cortex (So posterior to the anterior subcentraI sulcus. Also shown are the symbols used in the remaining three panels to represent the density of retrogradely labeled neurons in the thalamus. Although it has not yet been established that granule cells are the primary recipients of thalamic afferent axons (White, '79), a direct relationship exists between the density of granule cells in layer IV and the thalamic afferent plexus throughout insular, parietal, and temporal cortices (Jones, '75a,b; Jones and Burton, '76). The density of the thalamic terminal plexus can also be estimated from the density and quality (i.e., coarse or fine nature) of the autoradiographic label, which probably reflects the size and density of the synaptic terminals (Jones and Burton, '76). By either measure, the density of thalamic terminals should be greater within insular-opercular cortex and area 3b on the precentral gyrus than on either the insula proper or along the outer face of the operculum. The autoradiographic injections of the ventrobasal thalamus that Burton and Jones ('76) used to parse SI cortex included not only the thalamic oral and perioral somatosensory area (VPM), but also the thalamic taste area (VPMpc). In the present report more circumscribed autoradiographic injections of the thalamic taste area reveal that the VPMpc projects to the precentral gyrus within area 3b rostral to (though perhaps partially overlapping) the oral and perioral somatosensory field. In fact, the axons innervating the rostral end of area 3b, arise from neurons in the VPMpc, the thalamic taste area (Benjamin, '63; Beckstead et al., '80). This pattern of thalamocortical organization was also observed by Roberts and Akert ('63) in a series of retrograde degeneration experiments involving the insular, opercular, and precentral regions of frontal cortex. Cortical cytoarchitecture and thalamic connectivity Although neurons in the VPMpc and VPM projected differentially to several cytoarchitectonic fields, the laminar 10969861, 1986, 2, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.902440208 by Rwth Aachen Hochschulbibliothe, Wiley Online Library on [12/09/2023]. The proximity of the gustatory and somatosensory areas in both the ventrobasal thalamus and the precentral gyms prevented us from ruling out the possibility that a small area of cortex on the lateral convexity receives overlapping gustatory and somatosensory projections.

The autoradiographic data were verified by injecting each cortical projection area with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and observing the pattern of retrogradely labeled somata within the thalamus. Injections in the precentral gyrus near the anterior subcentral sulcus retrogradely labeled neurons within VPMpc, whereas injections further caudally near the floor of the central sulcus labeled neurons within VPM. METHODS Subjects Fourteen juvenile and adult cynomolgus monkeys (M. fmcicularis) ranging in weight from 1.5 to 7.0 kg received injections of tritiated leucine and/or proline (50-125 pCiIp1) in either the thalamic taste area (the parvicellular division of the ventroposteromedial nucleus; VPMpc), or the thalamic trigeminal somatosensory nucleus (VPM), or in adjacent nongustatory, nonlingual areas. These autoradiographic deposits were made either by pressure injection (20-120 nl) or iontophoretically (+ lpA for 8-10 minutes). Bilateral tritiated amino acid injections were made in two monkeys after it was determined that all thalamocortical projections under study were ipsilateral. Five of these monkeys received bilateral injections. Areas of autoradiographic label, HRP-labeled neuronal perikarya, cytoarchitectonic boundaries, and injection sites were subsequently added to the anatomical charts by using bIood vessels and gross anatomical boundaries as landmarks. Autoradiographic and horseradish peroxidase injection sites were considered to have a primary focus and a halo of secondary involvement (e.g., Figs. Areas of light label (signal-to-noise ratio approximately 2:l) were noted only if the label could be traced from the injection site, appeared on two or more adjacent sections, and confirmed other cases where more definitive label was observed. RESULTS Cortical projections of the ventroposteromedial nucleus Discrete, unilateral, autoradiographic injections were made within the VPMpc (N = 3), VPM (N = 2), centromedianum (CM, N = l), and along the VPMpcNPM border (N = 3) in nine monkeys. In two additional cases bilateral injections were made in the VPMpc and VPM (cases HllR and H11L) and within the VPM and nucleus centromedianum (cases HlOR and HlOL). The differential distribution of the VPMpc and VPM efferent projections on cortex is best illustrated by those cases in which small, restricted autoradiographic injections were made. For this reason, the injections made in one bilateral preparation (cases HllR and H11L) and one unilateral case (case R4) are described in detail. Animals that received bilateral injections were given case numbers with the suffix R or L. In several of the experimental cases the autoradiographic injection spread beyond the ventrobasal thalamus into the CM. Autoradiographic injections of the CM (cases R14, HlOL) that did not spread into either VPMpc or VPM produced dense terminal label within the caudal ventrolateral putamen, but not within cortex. An additional control injection medial to the VPMpc in case R12 failed to label any cortical fields. Mechanical stimulation of the tongue did not drive neurons near the injection site, but was an effective stimulus for neurons at two other locations, 1.0 mm lateral and dorsal to the target. Although the injection was centered in the VPMpc, there was secondary involvement of the VPM and nucleus centromedianum (CM). Labeled axons were noted leaving the injection site anterior and lateral through the VPM and VPL as well as within the internal capsule. This thalamostriate projection was weak in this case, but more pronounced in others in which the injection sites involved ventral the CM to a greater degree. Efferent projections of the VPM: Case HllL, mediobasal injection The autoradiographic deposit in case H11L was made in the mediobasal corner of the VPM, 1.0 mrn lateral to an area where neurons responded to both gustatory and mechanical stimulation of the tongue (Figs.

Neurons within the region of the injection site responded to mechanical stimulation of the tongue, primarily of the contralateral side. Other labeled fibers reached motor and premotor cortex, caudal to the principal sulcus, presumably due to spread of the injection into the VL. Figure 8 summarizes the distribution of the thalamic afferent plexus observed in four separate experiments following autoradiographic injections into the VPMpc and VPM. Two of these injections have been described in detail previously.

The orthographic projection in the lower right corner shows the relationship between the data from this case and the total projection area based upon all of the VPMpc and VPM autoradiographic injections. The two injections differ, however, in that only one! injection (case H1OR) spread significantly into the VPMpc. Two additional autoradiographic injections (cases R4 and R9) placed further dorsolaterally within the VPM labeled cortex more medially and as far caudally as the floor of the central sulcus. Collectively, the injection sites in these preparations involved all of the VPMpc, as well as dorsal and medial VPM. HRP results In each case described above, the injection site spread beyond the target area making it difficult to determine precisely the nuclear boundaries from which the cortical labeling originated. The cells of origin within the thalamus were located by injecting HRP into each cortical area revealed in the autoradiographic experiments: orbitofrorital cortex, frontal insular, and opercular cortices and the lateral margin of the precentral gyrus. Figure 9 shows the location of four ELRP injection sites superimposed on an orthographic map sum- :\ \ \ - Fig. Orthographic projection summarizing the total distribution of cortical label based upon all of the VPMpc and VPM autoradiographic injections. The densest part of each of four autoradiographic injection sites was drawn on a single projection drawing of the left thalamus. Two small (30 nl) injections of HRP were made in lateral orbitofrontal cortex in case H13L after multineuron responses were recorded in the region during electrical stimulation of the VPMpc. In another preparation (case H12L) an injection made further caudally, in the insula proper, produced a similar pattern of light retrograde cell labeling in the VPMpc. In one case (H9R) there was retrograde label in the medial putamen following an HRP injection of the rostra1 precentral gym. A similar pattern of retrograde labeling was, found in the VPMpc following HRP injections into cortex lateral to the anterior subcentral sulcus (cases H2 and. corded at the injection site during gustatory and tactile stimulation of the posterior tongue as well as during elec-- trical stimulation of the VPMpc (latency 5-14 ms). Small clusters of densely labeled neurons were also foundl within the paralamellar division of medialis dorsalis (MD) and centralis lateralis following injections of HRP into the most rostral part of the precentral gyrus (cases H2, H9R, and H11). The labeled neurons observed in case H7 are probably due to inadvertent spread of the HRP injection to broken fibers o:f passage dorsal to the operculum. The cortex on the postcentral gyrus overlying this injection site was responsive to perioral tactile stimulation, usually of the lips and cheek. In the present experiment horseradish peroxidase injections into insular-opercular cortex and the precentral gyrus retrogradely labeled neurons in the VPMpc, but not in the pontine parabrachial nuclei or any other area caudal to the diencephalon. In a related set of experiments in Old World monkey, which will be reported separately, autoradiographic injections into the pontine parabrachial nuclei also failed to reveal any projections to cortex (Hamilton et al., '86).

An HRP injection near the floor of the central sulcus, where neurons were responsive to somesthetic hut not ystatory stimulation, retrogradely labeled neurons only in VPM. The autoradiographic injections of the ventrobasal thalamus that Burton and Jones ('76) used to parse SI cortex included not only the thalamic oral and perioral somatosensory area (VPM), but also the thalamic taste area (VPMpc). In the present report more circumscribed autoradiographic injections of the thalamic taste area reveal that the VPMpc projects to the precentral gyrus within area 3b rostral to (though perhaps partially overlapping) the oral and perioral somatosensory field. This was verified by injecting the VPMpc projection area on the precentral gyrus with horseradish peroxidase and observing retrogradely labeled somata within the VPMpc. Based on our injections of horseradish peroxidase into the precentral gyrus, we conclude that the laryngeal and gustatory areas are discrete. Previous descriptions of the afferent connections of the motor and sensory laryngeal areas were based upon large horseradish peroxidase injections that probably spread into the gustatory projection area as well (Jurgens, '82). In the present study horseradish peroxidase injections in the cortical gustatory area retrogradely labeled somata in the VPMpc and medialis dorsalis, but not in anterior cingulate or mediofrontal cortex.",,,

Neurogenesis of MD and ANT Dense [3H]dT labeling was observed in the MD during a two-week period (E30-E43) towards the end of what in the macaque (165 days of gestation) corresponds to the first trimester of human gestation, and during a similar time frame for the ANT (E31-E43) (Table 2).

Seminal work in this field has found that neurogenesis is temporally staggered throughout the macaque brain, as for example, neurogenesis begins and ends earlier in the hypothalamus than in the striatum (Brand and Rakic 1979; van Eerdenburg and Rakic 1994). An experimental study in the macaque brain that used fetal irradiation at E33-E42 to curtail neurogenesis reaffirms the temporal specificity in neurogenesis, as significant neuron reduction was found in the MD but not in the PUL (Selemon et al.

Selemon, Ph.D. Department of Neuroscience, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA Abstract Maternal injection of 3H-thymidine ([3H]dT) during gestation in non-human primates (NHPs) has been used to determine the time of neurogenesis for various brain areas, including the lateral geniculate (LGN) and the pulvinar (PUL) nuclei of the caudal thalamus. Here we examine neurogenesis in the rostral thalamus, with focus on the mediodorsal (MD) and the anterior nuclei (ANT), to determine if neurogenesis of rostral and caudal thalamic nuclei is concurrent or instead temporally staggered. Labeled neurons were mapped within a contour that encompassed the entire rostral thalamus. Our novel approach uncovered a previously undetected spatial-temporal patterning of neurogenesis in the thalamus. 1992), and hypothalamus (van Eerdenburg and Rakic 1994), was examined. The time of origin for neurons in two thalamic nuclei, the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN; E36-E43) and the pulvinar (PUL; E36-E45), was also determined (Rakic 1977a; Ogren and Rakic 1981). However, neurogenesis of countless brain areas, including the anterior (ANT) and mediodorsal (MD) nuclei of the thalamus, has yet to be investigated. Therefore, it is not known whether these more rostrally situated thalamic nuclei are generated at the same time as their more caudal counterparts, or conversely whether there is a temporal patterning of neurogenesis even within the thalamus. Early understanding of the function of the ANT and MD thalamic nuclei was inferred from patterns of connectivity with other regions. For example, Papezs proposed circuit of emotion included interconnections of the ANT with the hypothalamus, cingulate gyrus, and hippocampus (Papez 1937). The MD is a higher order thalamic relay nucleus with complex, reciprocal connectivity with the prefrontal cortex, as well as input from the medial temporal lobe, striatum, and brain stem (Goldman-Rakic and Porrino 1985; Duque and McCormick 2010; Mitchell 2015; Vertes et al. The MD has also been identified as an important node in the cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical loop that funnels information from widespread cortical areas to the prefrontal cortex (Alexander and Crutcher 1990). Indeed, it has been postulated that thalamo-cortical and cortico-thalamic interconnections reinforce cognitive processes of higher order cortical regions, such that damage to these connections could lead to extensive impairment in the prefrontal cortex processing and ultimately hinder executive functions (Mitchell 2015). As an increased risk of developing schizophrenia has been shown to occur following prenatal insult, these findings suggest that curtailment of thalamic neurogenesis may contribute to the pathogenesis of schizophrenia (Brown 2012; Selemon and Zecevic 2015). However, our analysis was not limited to these two nuclei but extended throughout the entire rostral thalamus, revealing a previously undetected topography in the temporal sequence of neurogenesis in the thalamus. Knowing the time of origin of thalamic neurons in non-human primates will provide valuable information for identifying windows of vulnerability to disruption of thalamocortical circuits in neurodevelopmental disorders like schizophrenia and autism. The search function of MBR was used to identify [3H]dT labeled brains of Macaca mulatta monkeys from Collection 1 that were suitable for birth-dating of thalamic neurons. Based on previous studies of neurogenesis in the thalamus (Rakic 1977a; Ogren and Rakic 1981), search parameters included experimental treatment dates, i.e., maternal injection of [3H]dT, ranging from embryonic day 25 (E25) to E50 and postnatal sacrifice dates. It is noteworthy that during the time window investigated in the present study, the vast majority of the newly generated cells destined to populate the thalamus are neurons and not glia. Autoradiographically processed, Nissl-counterstained sections of the thalamus mounted on slides were located for each of these cases. Slides spanning the rostral thalamus were selected for scanning on an Aperio ScanScope HR CS2 scanner at 20X magnification. For each image file, the Trace tool was used to draw a closed contour around the thalamus at a zoom level equivalent to a magnification of ~ 5X. Results Comparison of [3H]dT labeling across the embryonic ages studied (E25-E50) revealed a distinct spatial-temporal patterning of neurogenesis in the rostral thalamus (Figures 4, 5). The earliest detected cells were located in the medial rostral thalamus (E30-E31), followed by more widespread cellular populations in lateral and ventrally situated nuclei (E38-E40). Neurogenesis of the rostral thalamus (E25-E27):At E25 (Table 2), only a few scattered labeled cells were found in the thalamus. (E30-E31):At E30-E31 (Table 2, Figure 4, 5), thalamic labeling was characterized by a compact medial band that included the medial MD, the midline nuclei, and the intralaminar nuclei (central medial nucleus (CeM), CL, parafascicular nucleus (Pf)). (E38-E40):At E38-E40 (Table 2, Figure 4, 5), overall labeling was more evenly and widely distributed throughout the rostral thalamus, extending into more laterally situated nuclei: the lateral MD, the VL, the reticular nucleus (Ret), the ventral posterior nucleus (VP), and the centromedian nucleus (CM). At very rostral levels of the thalamus, moderate labeling was observed in the ANT and the VA. More caudally, labeling was light in these nuclei. At the most caudal levels of the thalamus that were examined, labeling was particularly prominent in the ventral medial nucleus (VM) and the VP. (E43):At E43 (Table 2, Figure 4, 5), labeling was predominantly located in the lateral thalamus at rostral levels. More caudally, labeling was widespread throughout the thalamus but most dense dorsomedially. At E50, labeling was scarce in the thalamus, with light labeling present in the midline nuclei, the MD, and the Pf. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Discussion This study establishes that neurogenesis in the thalamus of the macaque brain is not temporally homogeneous but rather exhibits spatial-temporal patterning. Seminal work in this field has found that neurogenesis is temporally staggered throughout the macaque brain, as for example, neurogenesis begins and ends earlier in the hypothalamus than in the striatum (Brand and Rakic 1979; van Eerdenburg and Rakic 1994). Our study indicates that nuclei within the thalamus have non-uniform, albeit overlapping, periods of neurogenesis. In addition, a prior study established that within one nucleus of the thalamus, the LGN, the gradient for cell population is outside to inside, the opposite of that in the cortex; neurons generated earlier go to the outmost surface of the LGN and those generated later progressively accumulate in more inner positions (Rakic 1977b). The present study examined neurogenesis across multiple nuclei in the rostral thalamus and found a complex, temporally-dependent topography. Early generated cells populate the medial margin of the thalamus, followed by more widespread population concentrated ventrolaterally, and finally by the appearance of labeled cells predominantly in lateral nuclei at rostral levels and more widespread caudally. New insights into the topographic patterning of neurogenesis in the thalamus may contribute to contemporary neuromorphologic models, e.g., the prosomeric model, that are based on genoarchitectonic patterning and data from developmental experimentation (Puelles 2019). Interspecies Comparisons Maternal injection of [3H]dT also has been used to examine the development of thalamic nuclei in rodents. Taking into account that the duration of rodent gestation is much shorter (~21 days) in comparison to primates (165 days), the onset of thalamic neurogenesis in rodents (E10 for mice; E13 for rats) occurs later in the gestational period relative to thalamogenesis in primates (Angevine 1970; Altman and Bayer 1988). In contrast to the neurogenetic patterning of the primate thalamus described in this study, neurogenesis of the rodent thalamus exhibits caudo-rostral and latero-medial gradients (McAllister and Das 1977). In the thalamus as a whole, there exists additional opposing temporal spatial gradients, in which neurogenesis in rodents begins in laterally situated nuclei and spreads medially throughout, whereas neurogenesis of the medial thalamus precedes the lateral portion in primates (Angevine 1970; McAllister and Das 1977). While we lacked data for several intervening ages, we were able to observe the trajectory of cell proliferation and identify predominant shifts in patterning of the rostral thalamus over time. From a broader perspective, the topographic patterning of thalamic neurogenesis suggests that fetal insult at different ages may be associated with Spadory et al.

Selemon, Ph.D. Department of Neuroscience, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, USA Abstract Maternal injection of 3H-thymidine ([3H]dT) during gestation in non-human primates (NHPs) has been used to determine the time of neurogenesis for various brain areas, including the lateral geniculate (LGN) and the pulvinar (PUL) nuclei of the caudal thalamus. The MacBrainResource (MBR) search function identified archived cases (N=10) of [3H]dT labeled specimens, with injection dates ranging from embryonic day 25 (E25)-E50 and postnatal sacrifice dates. The time of neurogenesis of many brain areas in the NHP has been determined by means of maternal injection of 3H-thymidine ([3H]dT) at various gestational ages. In these studies, systemically injected [3H]dT was incorporated into the DNA of dividing cells. those cells that had undergone only one final division between time of injection and time of sacrifice. Based on previous studies of neurogenesis in the thalamus (Rakic 1977a; Ogren and Rakic 1981), search parameters included experimental treatment dates, i.e., maternal injection of [3H]dT, ranging from embryonic day 25 (E25) to E50 and postnatal sacrifice dates. Specifically, following systemic injection of [3H]dT at embryonic ages, the brains were fixed via perfusion with Karnovskys solution. A cell was considered labeled for [ 3H]dT, and therefore to have undergone final cell division at the time of injection, if 5 silver grains were visible over the cell (Figure 3). Interspecies Comparisons Maternal injection of [3H]dT also has been used to examine the development of thalamic nuclei in rodents. Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Author Manuscript Technical Considerations Data were collected from brains at various gestational ages, but not every embryonic age was examined, because the original studies injected animals only at selected ages and because certain cases were excluded from analysis due to insufficient quality of cell labeling. In doing so, we found that case 080872A, which previously had been designated as having an injection at E53/E54, in fact had been injected at E48. Today, these experiments, which involve timed pregnancies, systemic injection of [3H]dT in pregnant monkeys, monitoring of fetal health, a functioning infant primate nursery, and long-term survival times, would not only be prohibitively expensive but would also be nearly impossible to replicate given the strict regulatory guidelines for primate research. [3H]dT labeled neurons are shown in monkeys injected at gestational ages E30 (a, d, g), E38 (b, e, h), and E43 (c, f, i), and sacrificed postnatally.

YETERIAN AND DEEPAK N. PANDYA Department of Psychology, Colby College, Waterville, Maine 04901 (E.H.Y. ABSTRACT This study addressed the issue of whether paralimbic regions of the cerebral cortex share common thalamic projections. The corticothalamic connections of the paralimbic regions of the orbital frontal, medial prefrontal, cingulate, parahippocampal, and temporal polar cortices were studied with the autoradiographic method in the rhesus monkey. These proisocortical areas also have thalamic connections with the intralaminar and midline nuclei. Thus, it appears that the proisocortical areas, which are characterized by a predominance of infragranular layers and an absence of layer IV, have common thalamic relationships. Key words: thalamus, proisocortical, cortex, pulvinar, dorsomedial nucleus Cortical areas are differentiated on the basis of both architecture and connections. It has long been known that certain cortical regions have preferential relationships with particular thalamic nuclei. Moreover, in recent years it has become apparent that cortical areas with certain cytoarchitectonic features have specific thalamic relationships. Thus, areas at similar architectonic stages, that is, areas with comparable architectonic features, in SPL and IPL, are related to similar types of thalamic nuclei (Yeterian and Pandya, '85). Classically, in terms of thalamic connectivity, some of these regions, in particular the cingulate gyrus, have been described as being intimately connected with the so-called limbic nuclei of the thalamus, that is, the anterior nuclear group and the lateral dorsal nucleus (Akert, '64; Yakovlev et al., '66; Vogt et al., '79; Baleydier and Mauguiere, '80).l Other regions, such as the orbital frontal and ventromedial temporal cortices, as well as the cingulate gyrus, have been shown to be connected with the dorsomedial and pulvinar nuclei (Clark and Boggon, '35; Clark, '36; Whitlock and Nauta, '56; Nauta, '64; Bos and Benevento, '75; Tobias, '75; Trojanowski and Jacobson, '76; Kievit and Kuypers, '77; Gower, '81; Siwek and Pandya, '84; Goldman-Rakic and Porrino, '85; Baleydier and Mauguiere, '85; Markowitsch et al., '85). It is not known whether the paralimbic cortices as a group have a common thalamic projection zone which both ties them together and distinguishes them from other isocortical regions. In this investigation, we addressed this issue by tracing thalamic projections of selected orbital frontal, medial prefrontal, cingulate, parahippocampal, and temporal polar regions, using the autoradiographic method. MATERIALS AND METHODS The corticothalamic connections of the paralimbic weas were traced in 13 rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) with radioactively labeled amino acids. This stain permitted the analysis of cortical cytoarchitecture, localization of the injection site, and identification of the boundaries of thalamic nuclei. The distribution of terminal label as revealed in each section was charted onto coronal tracings of the thalamus under darkfield illumination. The boundaries of various thalamic nuclei were determined from the thionin-stained sections under brightfield illumination. The atlas of Olszewski ('52) was used as a reference for delineating thalamic boundaries and for nomenclature. The resulting silver grains indicating terminal labeling in case 1 were found predominantly over two thalamic nucleinamely, the dorsomedial (MD) and the medial pulvinar 'The term limbic nuclei refers to the anterior nuclear group (AV, AM, AD) and the lateral dorsal (LD) nucleus, which are known to be connected with cortical limbic areas (Powell et al., '57; Yakovlev et al., '66; Amaral and Cowan, '80; Baleydier and Mauguiere, '80; Pandya et al., '81; Mufson and Pandya, '84; Aggleton et al., '86).

Other thalamic nuclei which showed evidence of terminal label, but which are not illustrated, are the centralis densocellularis (Cdc) and parataenial (Pt) nuclei. Some grains were noted over other thalamic nuclei (not illustrated): midline nuclei (Cdc; centralis inferior, Cif; Pt; Re), intralaminar nuclei (Pcn; CS), and the ventral lateral (VL) nucleus. Terminal label also was observed over the anterior thalamic nuclei (AV, AM) and intralaminar nuclei (CSL) as well as the caudal portion of the ventral lateral (VLc) and the lateral posterior (LP) nuclei. Also shown are four representative coronal sections through the thalamus from rostral (A) to caudal (D), depicting the distribution of terminal label (shown as dots) in various nuclei. Also shown are four representative sections through the thalamus from rostral (A) to caudal (D), depicting the distribution of terminal label in various nuclei. In this and subsequent figures, the vertical marks on the hemispheric surface indicate the line of cut in the coronal plane for the thalamic sections. Thalamic connections must also play a significant role in complex functions of the cerebral cortex, since the cerebral cortex and the thalamus are heavily interconnected. A number of investigations have delineated the intricacies of the thalamic relationships of primary and parasensory association areas. Relatively few studies have addressed the issue of the thalamic connectivity of paralimbic regions (Yakovlev et al., '66; Vogt et al., '79; Baleydier and Mauguiere, '80, '87; Mufson and Mesulam, '84; Markowitsch et al., '85; Goldman-Rakic and Porrino, '85; Moran et al., '87). Diagrams showing an isotope injection site in the caudal part of the cingulate gyrus, area 23 (case 6), as well as four representative thalamic sections depicting the distribution of resulting silver grains. ent study, we have attempted to delineate the organizational principles of connections from paralimbic regions to the thalamus. The paralimbic areas are located in the mediobasal regions of the cerebral hemisphere, and have preferential projections to the medial pulvinar and dorsomedial nuclei as well as to intralaminar, midline, and limbic thalamic nuclei. A different pattern of thalamic connectivity is observed for the paralimbic regions which are intermediate to proisocortex on the one hand and isocortex on the other. as well as remesentative thalamic sections for each case showing the unlike proisocortical area 24, projects predominantly to the PM nucleus with relatively weak projections to the MD nucleus. Although traditionally the limbic nuclei of the thalamus (AV, AM, AD, and LD) have been considered to have the most intimate relationship with paralimbic areas, it appears that the dorsomedial and medial pulvinar nuclei, as well as the midline and intralaminar nuclei, also have close ties with these regions. With regard to the anterior group of thalamic nuclei, only certain paralimbic regions appear to project to these nuclei. The midportion of the cingulate gyrus seems to have connections to both the AM and AV thalamic nuclei. The thalamic projections of paralimbic regions as a group appear to reflect their intermediate architectonic position. Thus, on the one hand these regions project to limbic as well as midline and intralaminar thalamic nuclei and on the other to the medial pulvinar and dorsomedial nuclei. This may indicate that the corticothalamic connections of paralimbic areas are organized in a manner consistent with their position intermediate to limbic and neocortical regions.

Another thalamic link of certain paralimbic regions is with the so-called limbic nuclei, the anterior nuclear group and the lateral dorsal nucleus (Yakovlev et al., '66).

These latter features are more typical of isocortical regions, which themselves are well known to relate primarily to modality-specific thalamic nuclei. Support for an interpretation indicating that the paralimbic areas are at a similar architectonic stage (Sanides, '69, '72; Pandya and Yeterian, '85) is provided by evidence of similar thalamic connections. Likewise, the posterior cingulate and the lateral parahippocampal gyri, both of which are intermediate to proisocortex on the one hand and isocortex on the other, share common thalamic targets-namely, the PM and LD nuclei. Finally, the differential thalamic connectivity of proisocortical and adjoining paralimbic areas suggests that these cortical groups along with their thalamic connections may compose functional subunits within the forebrain (Vogt et al., '79; Baleydier and Mauguiere, '80). In regard to the possible functional significance of paralimbic-thalamic connectivity, it is well known that the paralimbic regions have a role in emotional and motivational functions (e.g., Mesulam, '81, '83; Damasio and Van Hoesen, '83). As pointed out above, the orbital frontal and temporal polar cortices have common thalamic projection zones and have been shown to have markedly similar functional roles. The common thalamic connectivity of the orbital frontal and temporal polar regions to the medial portions of both the MD and PM nuclei may play a role in the similar functions of these two regions. However, there is certain specificity in the thalamic projections from the anterior and posterior cingulate regions. In this regard, it is of interest to note that the thalamic connectivity of the anterior cingulate gyrus is mainly to the MD nucleus, whereas the posterior cingulate region is connected primarily with the medial pulvinar (Vogt et al., '79; Baleydier and Mauguiere, '80, '85, '87). It may be that this differential cingulothalamic connectivity underlies, in part, the functional differentiation of these regions. Thus, the corticothalamic connectivity of this paralimbic region may, in part, be involved in complex perceptual-integrative functions. In conclusion, although the precise functional role of paralimbic-thalamic connectivity is not known, these connections may be involved in processes which are consistent with the intermediate position of paralimbic areas between limbic and isocortical structures.

This stain permitted the analysis of cortical cytoarchitecture, localization of the injection site, and identification of the boundaries of thalamic nuclei. The precise location of each injection site was determined by observing the cortical architecture around the labeled area in the cortex and comparing this with the architecture of the corresponding nonlabeled area of the opposite hemisphere. Orbital frontal and medial prefrontal proisocortices In two cases, separate injections were made into the caudal orbital frontal and rostra1 medial prefrontal regions (Fig. In case 1, the injection involved the caudal portion of area 13 in the orbital frontal cortex, whereas in case 2, the injection occupied area 32 and extended slightly into adjoining area 25 of the medial prefrontal cortex. In case 2, with an injection in the medial prefrontal proisocortical region, the distribution of terminal label was also predominantly over the dorsomedial and medial pulvinar nuclei. Cingulate gyrus In five cases, injections were made in various subdivisions of the cingulate gyrus throughout its rostral-caudal extent. Cases 3 and 4 both involved injections into area 24 of the anterior cingulate gyrus. Case 5 received an injection in the middle portion of the cingulate gyrus, which involved caudal area 24 and rostral area 23. In cases 6 and 7, injections were placed in the caudal portion of the cingulate gyrus, area 23. In case 7, the injection involved the retrosplenial area as well as the Fig. Top: Diagrammatic representation of the basal surface of the cerebral hemisphere showing an isotope injection site (dark area) in the caudal orbital frontal cortex, area 13 (case 1, upper left).

Benevento Michael Rezak R. Santos-Anderson College of Medicine, University of Illinois Medical Center, Chicago, Ill. 60680 U.S.A. Autoradiographic tracing methods were used to determine the differential projections of the pretectal nuclei, in the rhesus monkey, in relation to their inputs. The projections of the pretectum involve a number of structures within the thalamus and brain stem and there are differences in the projection targets of the pretectal region which receives direct visual input (i.e., SL and ON) and the region which does not (i.e., nucleus of the posterior commissure, NPC). For example, while all pretectal regions project within the pretectum and to the SC, accessory oculomotor nuclei, reticular formation, intralaminar nuclei and hypothalamus, it is only the retino-recipient zone which projects to rostral regions such as the visceral oculomotor nuclei, the lateral pulvinar, the border between the lateral pulvinar and medial pulvinar, the oral pulvinar as well as to the thalamic reticular nucleus, ventral lateral geniculate nucleus, zona incerta and other structures. In contrast to the SC, the pretectum does not project to any of the visual relay nuclei of the thalamus, such as the inferior pulvinar, which project to the visual cortices.

On the basis of these findings the frontal cortex was subdivided into seven transverse cortical strips which receive afferents from seven longitudinal bands of thalamic neurons. The most rostral transverse strip receives afferents from the most medial thalamic band which is oriented vertically and extends through the most medial part of the MD into the medial pulvinar. Progressively more caudally located transverse strips receive afferents from progressively more laterally located thalamic bands which in part are situated in the VL and show an increasing tilt towards the horizontal. Moreover, those parts of the various bands which are situated along the dorsal and lateral margin of the thalamus project to the medial portions of the transverse cortical strips, i.e. along the medial margin of the frontal lobe, while the other parts situated ventromedially in the thalamus project to the lateral portions of these strips, i.e. These data provide an alternative view of the organization of the thalamus and suggest that this structure contains a matrix of longitudinal cell columns which in some cases extend across specific nuclear borders and may represent the basic thalamic building blocks in respect to the thalamo-cortical connexions. Key words: Thalamus - Frontal cortex - Cortical HRP injections - Thalamo-frontal connexions - Rhesus monkey - Thalamic organization Introduction The organization of thalamo-cortical connexions has been studied repeatedly since the pioneering efforts of Le Gros Clark (1935) and Walker (193 8a). Kuypers establish from which thalamic cell group a certain cortical area receives its afferents. Moreover, a considerable amount of cortical tissue must be removed in order to obtain pronounced retrograde changes in a circumscribed portion of the thalamus (Walker, 1938a). Therefore, in a series of rhesus monkeys HRP was injected in different frontal cortical areas and the distribution of the retrogradely labelled thalamic neurons was studied. This study forms a part of a larger endeavour aimed at clarifying the organization of the cerebello-thalamo-cortical connexions. The data obtained in the present study are expected to make it possible to determine the ultimate cortical destination of the projections from the various cerebellar nuclei to the different parts of the thalamus. Since in these cases labelled thalamic neurons were present only ipsilaterally, in the remaining 10 animals injections were made in both hemispheres and the labelled neurons in the thalamus on either side were regarded to reflect only the injections in the ipsilateral hemisphere. The location of the retrogradely labelled HRP-positive thalamic neurons was charted with the aid of an X-Y plotter linked by means of transducers to the microscope state. In all cases groups of thalamic neurons contained HRP-positive granules. cases B7, C4, D1) the underlying white matter contains not only thalamic fibres to the surface cortex but also fibres to the opercular cortex. It had been assumed that after HRP injections in the different frontal areas, different specific thalamic nuclei would be labelled. After injections in the rostral parts of the frontal lobe the bands and columns were located medially in the thalamus, while after progressively more caudal injections they were located progressively more laterally. Three-Dimensional Configuration of the Thalamic Nuclei In order to facilitate the description of the thalamic distribution of the columns and bands of labelled neurons, the three-dimensional configuration of the major thalamic nuclei in the rhesus monkey as described by Olszewski (1952) will be briefly outlined. The thalamus is wedge-shaped and tapers rostrally (Fig. It is subdivided in a mediodorsal and a lateroventral compartment by the internal medullary lamina which in horizontal sections runs parallel to the lateral side of the thalamic wedge rather than parallel to the midline (Fig. 302 J. Kievit and H. G. J. M. Kuypers The mammillo-thalamic tract (TMT) passes through the rostral part of the internal medullary lamina. The elongated MD has its largest cross sectional dimension at midthalamic levels. The pulvinar belongs mainly to the lateroventral compartment, which is oriented from caudolateral to rostromedial, somewhat parallel to the lateral side of the thalamic wedge. Thus the rostral part of the lateroventral compartment is situated immediately rostral to the lateral expansion of the MD at midthalamic levels (Fig. The caudal border of the VA is oriented from rostrolateral to caudomedial, roughly perpendicular to the lateral side of the thalamic wedge.

Kievit and H. G. J. M. Kuypers Distribution of Retrogradely Labelled Thalamic Neurons A. Injections in Orbitofrontal Cortex and Rostral Part of Frontal Convexity In the four cases of this group the longitudinal bands or columns of labelled neurons were located mainly in the medial part of the thalamus where they extended from the area of the anterior midline nuclei (Ce) and the medial part of the VA through the MD into the anterior part of the Pm (Fig. Labelled thalamic neurons were present in the medial part of the anterior nucleus, especially the AM and AV as well as in the RE and the Ce, in particular the CDc (Fig. The labelled thalamic neurons in this case also formed a somewhat sagittally oriented column which, however, was situated slightly more laterally than in case A1 and occupied a dorsal position especially in the MD (Fig. These columns occupied together a slightly tilted broad longitudinal thalamic band which was oriented somewhat parallel to the midline (cf. Thus this band and its constituent columns when traced caudally seem to shift from lateral to medial in the thalamus. However, this shift is more apparent than real because due to Thalamo-Frontal Connexions in Monkey 305 the wedge-shape of the thalamus a longitudinally oriented cell column which extends roughly parallel to the midline inevitably becomes located further and further away from the lateral thalamic border at progressively more caudal levels (Fig. Thus in the rostral thalamus many labelled neurons were present in the VAmc and the medial parts of the VApc and some were present in the Ce. 1) the labelled neurons were most numerous at midthalamic levels where they tended to be concentrated in the area between the populations of cases B 1 and B2.

For comparison, the total thalamic area occupied by the labelled 'neurons after injections in the caudal parts of the precentral gyrus is shown on the right Thalamo-Frontal Connexions in Monkey 307 and immediately caudal to the inferior limb of this sulcus (B7) respectively (Fig. Thus in the rostral thalamus a limited group of labelled neurons was present (Fig. Semidiagrammatic representation of the HRP-positive cortical areas (solid black, ++ , o~169 ) and the distributions of the retrogradely labelled thalamic neurons (~o , +% , o~ ) after injections in the caudal part of the precentral gyrus. Column on right shows combined distributions of the labelled neurons in the central and peripheral parts of the thalamus in cases with injections along medial ( . In three cases (C14, C15 and C16) with 18, 16 and 5 injections respectively in the upper portion of the caudal part of the precentral gyrus and the immediately underlying white matter the longitudinal group of labelled neurons was located very laterally in the thalamus and extended from the lateral parts of the VLo into the lateral parts of the VIM and the ventrolateral portion of the VLc. Surprisingly enough, retrogradely labelled neurons were present not only in the caudal part of the thalamus but also in its rostral part. Discussion The present findings demonstrate that HRP-injections in different frontal cortical areas result in the labelling of longitudinal columns of thalamic neurons. Due to the wedge-shape of the thalamus as seen in horizontal sections, many of these longitudinal bands display along their rostrocaudal trajectory an apparent medial shift away from the lateral thalamic border and in several cases cross the obliquely oriented internal medullary lamina. The most rostral transverse strip appears to receive afferents from the most medial thalamic band, while the progressively more caudal strips receive afferents from. Thus the bands are distributed through a thalamic cross section as the ribs of a fan radiating from the area at the lower margin of the massa intermedia (Fig. those parts located ventromedially in the thalamus, appear to project to the lateral parts of the transverse cortical strips adjoining the lateral fissure, while the peripheral parts located dorsally, dorsolaterally and laterally in the thalamus appear to project to the medial parts of these strips adjoining the medial margin of the hemisphere (cf. When taking this into account, the present findings make it possible to distinguish seven transverse frontal cortical strips and longitudinal thalamic bands, the approximate positions of which are shown diagrammatically in Fig. This periarcuate area appears to receive afferents from a slightly tilted broad thalamic band which extends from the medial three-fourths of the VApc through the dorsal and medial parts of the rostral VLo, area X, as well as the VLm, across the medullary lamina into the paralaminar MD and the anterior part of the Pro. strip 3 and strip 5, receive afferents from the medial and lateral parts of this broad thalamic band, i.e. Diagrammatic approximation of the position of eight transverse cortical strips (see text) and the corresponding eight thalamic afferent bands. Earlier studies have defined the organization of the thalamo-cortical projecti~)ns by outlining the cortical distribution area of the various specific thalamic nuclei. However, the present data also suggest that the population of thalamic neurons which project from a specific nucleus to a certain cortical area form part of a band or column of neurons which may extend from one nucleus into another. The VA, because the strong labelling of its neurons as compared to the CL (Jones and Leavitt, 1974) will be regarded as a specific thalamic nucleus. The projections from the central and peripheral parts of the thalamic bands tothelateral and medialparts of thefrontal lobe respectively (Fig.3) provide a framework for the earlier conclusions that the neurons projecting to the frontal operculum and the insula are located around the CM-Pf (Roberts and Akert, 1963) while the neurons dorsally in the MD project to the medial parts of the frontal lobe (Walker, 1938a; Akert, 1964). in the middle one-third of the mediolateral extent of the periarcuate area (cases B3, B4, B5) also conforms to this principle because the lateral paralaminar MD is located in the intermediate one-third of the broad periarcuate thalamic band (bands 3, 4 and 5). In view of the present findings the thalamus seems to contain a hidden matrix of longitudinal cell columns which may represent the basic thalamic building blocks in respect to the specific thalamo-cortical connexions. Such a matrix would imply that afferents to two different nuclei located in different parts of the thalamus may ultimately converge on the same cortical area. For example the intrathalamic trajectories of the thalamo-cortical and the cortico-thalamic fibres to and from the rostral part of the frontal lobe display a similar rostrocaudal orientation as the longitudinal columns projecting to these cortical areas (Scheibel and Scheibel, 1966, 1967) and these trajectories apparently involve the MD together with the VA (Showers, 1958; DeVito and Smith, 1964; Astruc, 1971; Tobias, 1975; Tanaka, 1976). The trajectories of the descending intrathalamic fibres (Carmel, 1972) from the VA across the internal medullary lamina into the MD and of the ascending CM fibres through the internal medullary lamina and the VA to the putamen (Mehler, 1966) also seem to conform to the matrix. 6 Thalamo-Frontal Connexions in Monkey 319 Assuming the existence of such a thalamic matrix it is, however, surprising that only few studies (Le Gros Clark and Boggon, 1935; Tanaka, 1973) reported columns of retrograde degeneration extending across nuclear borders after frontal lesions. This may be due to the fact that the thalamus has generally been studied in transverse sections and strong emphasis has been placed on midthalamic levels (Akert, 1964). It may also be due to the fact that only the MD segment of the prefrontal thalamic band shows severe degeneration since the retrograde changes in the VA generally are less pronounced than in the MD (Walker, 1938a; Powell, 1952) and those in the anterior part of the Pm apparently only occur after combining frontal lesions with rostral temporal lesions (Chow, 1950). However, it may also be argued that the longitudinal distribution of labelled neurons across nuclear borders does not represent a thalamic organization but reflects the rather large size of the HRP-positive areas comprising parts of the presumably distinct projection areas of the different specific nuclei.

Key words: Thalamus - Frontal cortex - Cortical HRP injections - Thalamo-frontal connexions - Rhesus monkey - Thalamic organization Introduction The organization of thalamo-cortical connexions has been studied repeatedly since the pioneering efforts of Le Gros Clark (1935) and Walker (193 8a). Therefore, in a series of rhesus monkeys HRP was injected in different frontal cortical areas and the distribution of the retrogradely labelled thalamic neurons was studied. Materials and Methods In 23 rhesus monkeys 6-25 closely spaced injections of 0.6 ~tl, of 10-30% horseradish peroxidase (HRP, Sigma VI) dissolved in distilled water, were made in circumscribed parts of the frontal cortex by means of a Hamilton syringe with a 22 gauge needle, which was introduced to a depth of + 21/2 ram. In 13 of the animals the injections were made in one hemisphere. Since in these cases labelled thalamic neurons were present only ipsilaterally, in the remaining 10 animals injections were made in both hemispheres and the labelled neurons in the thalamus on either side were regarded to reflect only the injections in the ipsilateral hemisphere. From the injected cortex and the immediately underlying white matter evenly brown stained fibers proceeded towards the internal capsule. In the cases with injections in the lower one-third of the precentral and postcentral gyri (cf. The experiments may be subdivided into four groups: A. cases with injections in the orbitofrontal cortex and the cortex of the most rostral portion of the frontal convexity; B. cases with injections in the periarcuate cortex, i.e. above, below and within the concavity of the arcuate sulcus; C. cases with injections in the precentral gyrus; and D. cases with injections in the postcentral and parietal areas. It had been assumed that after HRP injections in the different frontal areas, different specific thalamic nuclei would be labelled. After injections in the rostral parts of the frontal lobe the bands and columns were located medially in the thalamus, while after progressively more caudal injections they were located progressively more laterally.

Kievit and H. G. J. M. Kuypers Distribution of Retrogradely Labelled Thalamic Neurons A. Injections in Orbitofrontal Cortex and Rostral Part of Frontal Convexity In the four cases of this group the longitudinal bands or columns of labelled neurons were located mainly in the medial part of the thalamus where they extended from the area of the anterior midline nuclei (Ce) and the medial part of the VA through the MD into the anterior part of the Pm (Fig. In case A2 with 15 injections in the cortex on the convexity of the rostral part of the frontal lobe and in the underlying white matter, the HRP-positive cortical area extended from the injection site into the most anterior parts of the orbitofrontal cortex, and the superior frontal gyrus on the medial surface of the hemisphere. In cases A3 and A4 with 12 injections more laterally, above and below the rostral part of the principal sulcus respectively, the longitudinal columns of labelled neurons behaved in roughly the same manner as in case A2 but occupied a relatively more ventral portion in the VA and the MD (Fig. This was especially obvious in case A4 with injections lateral to the principal sulcus. In five cases (B 1-B5) injections were made rostrally in the periarcuate area. In case B1 with 18 injections around the rostral tip of the upper limb of the arcuate sulcus the HRP-positive cortical area overlapped rostrally with that of case A2 and extended from the superior frontal gyrus on the medial surface of the hemisphere into the intermediate portion of the upper bank of the principal sulcus. In case B2, 6 injections were made laterally in the periarcuate area, i.e. In case B3 with 25 injections in the arcuate gyrus (Fig. In two additional cases (B4 and B5) with 12 and 15 injections in the arcuate gyrus above and below the caudal part of the principal sulcus respectively, the longitudinal groups of labelled neurons occupied roughly the same position as in case B3 but the one in case B4 with the injections above the principal sulcus tended to be located slightly more dorsally than the one in case B5 with the injections below the sulcus. In two other cases (B6 and B7) 19 injections were made more caudally in the periarcuate area, i. e. in the caudal part of the area above the arcuate sulcus (B6) 306 J. Kievit and H. G. J. M.

For comparison, the total thalamic area occupied by the labelled 'neurons after injections in the caudal parts of the precentral gyrus is shown on the right Thalamo-Frontal Connexions in Monkey 307 and immediately caudal to the inferior limb of this sulcus (B7) respectively (Fig. C. Injections in the Precentral Gyrus In the first two cases (C1 and C2) of this group injections were made in the rostral part of the precentral gyrus but in the other cases in the caudal parts. In the first two cases (C1 and C2) linear rows of seven to eight injections were made rostrally in the precentral gyrus, parallel to the central sulcus. In case C2 in which the row of injections continued into the lower one-third of the precentral gyrus, the longitudinal population of labelled neurons extended ventromedially (Fig. In the other cases of this group, with injections in different mediolateral parts of the caudal portion of the precentral gyrus, tall vertically oriented longitudinal groups of labelled neurons occurred which after progressively more lateral injections in the precentral gyrus were located progressively more medially in VL.

However, in cases C14 and C16 with injections in the cortex immediately adjoining the upper portion of the central sulcus, the group of labelled neurons continued caudally into the most lateral part of the VPLc (case C14, Fig. 3), while in case C15 without injections in this area no labelled neurons were present in the VPLc. In addition, in all cases with injections in the caudal part of the precentral gyrus many lightly labelled neurons were present in the caudal parts of the CL and some in the CM. In four other cases linear rows of injections were made which extended from the central sulcus rostrally. In cases Cll-C13 these rows of 16 injections extended through the area of the superior precentral dimple towards the area above the caudal part of the arcuate sulcus, while in case C17 a longer linear row of injections was placed along the medial margin of the hemisphere, extending from the upper part of the precentral gyrus into the area above the upper limb of the arcuate sulcus (cases Cll and C17, Fig. In case C4, 8 injections were made around the inferior precentral dimple, i.e. D. Postcentral and Parietal Injections In case D1, 10 injections were made in the rostral part of the postcentral gyrus. In case D2, 18 injections were made in the superior and the inferior parietal lobules. Discussion The present findings demonstrate that HRP-injections in different frontal cortical areas result in the labelling of longitudinal columns of thalamic neurons. Cortical Strips and Thalamic Bands The various injection sites were chosen such that the resulting HRP-positive cortical areas could be combined into transverse cortical strips resembling the anatomical and functional subdivisions of the frontal lobe (yon Bonin and Bailey, 1947; Woolsey et al., 1950; Kuypers and Lawrence, 1967). Labelling of Specific Thalamic Nuclei The distribution of labelled MD neurons after the various injections supports earlier conclusions (Walker, 1938a; Nauta, 1962; Akert, 1964; Tobias, 1975) concerning the organization of the MD projections to the frontal lobe. 1) with injections around the rostral end of the upper limb of the arcuate sulcus. The almost exclusive labelling of VPLc and VPM and VPI after postcentral injections is in keeping with earlier findings (Strick, 1976) and supports the contention that the VB complex, and apparently especially its caudal part (VPLc), projects mainly to areas 3, 1 and 2 (Jones and Powell, 1970; Burton and Jones, 1976). Labelling of neurons laterally in VPLc after injections in the rostral bank of the upper end of the central sulcus (cases C14 and C16) probably reflects the presence of area 3a in the deep part of the rostral bank at this level (Powell and Mountcastle, 1959). The existence of VPM projections to the postcentral gyms, the lower one-third of the precentral gyrus (area 3) and the precentral operculum (Walker, 1938a; Roberts and Akert, 1963; Burton and Jones, 1976) is compatible with the labelling of the VPM after precentral and postcentral injections (cases C3 and D1) and is in keeping with the existence of projections from the lower one-third of the precentral and the postcentral gyrus to the VPM (Sakai~ 1967; Kfinzle, 1976). The labelling of neurons in the lateral paralaminar MD after arcuate gyrus injections, i.e. For example, after rostral frontal injections these groups of neurons extended from the medial part of the VA, across the internal medullary lamina, through the MD into the Pm (cf. Moreover, after injections in the caudal part of the area above the arcuate sulcus (case B6, Fig. Yet, the fact that columns of labelled neurons extending through several nuclei also occurred after restricted injections (cases B2, C4) and that such columns show a systematic shift through the nuclei after injections in adjacent cortical areas (cf. 1) with injections around the rostral end of the upper limb of arcuate sulcus and (B) shows the labelled neurons in the lateral part of MD, in CL, and in the medial part of VL in case B6 (cf. 2) with injections in caudal part of the area above arcuate sulcus 320 J.

KULTAS-IIJNSKY Department of Anatomy, University of Iowa College of Medicine, Iowa City, Iowa 52242 ABSTRACT Cytoarchitectonic atlas plates of the Macaca m,irlatta thalamus are presented in the sagittal plane of section with a revised nomenclature of the motor thalamic region. The proposed changes in nomenclature are based on the analysis of topographical relationships between niy-al, pallidal, and cerebellar projections to the thalamus studied in 13 rhesus monkeys with the use of autoradiography technique. The available data on thalamic connectivity together with the results of the present study allowed us to divide the primate motor thalamus into two major territories: (1) the ventral anterior region (VA) and (2) the ventral lateral region (VL). Although the designation of these two areas of the motor thalamus is the same as the classic one, the nuclear subdivisions that compose them differ significantly from those described in previous classifications. As is delineated in the maps, VA represents the basal ganglia territory of the motor thalamus where nigral projections coincide with its magnocellular part (Vhmc), and pallidal projections occupy densicellular (VAdc) and parvicellular (VApc) subdivisions. The VL region is characterized as a distinct cytoarchitectonic entity of the motor thalamus that receives cerebellar projections and includes area X, VPLo, VLc, and VLps of Olszewski. Rather, in this study VM was treated as an intermediate zone between the subthalamus and motor thalamus where fiber bundles from basal ganglia and cerebellum are organized in a topographical manner before reaching their destinations in the VA and VL regions, respectively. Other major thalamic regions represented in lhe maps were delineated purely on cytoarchitectonic grounds and their traditional nomenclature was maintained. In this respect the present maps can be considered as a supplement to the available cytoarchitectonic atlases of the monkey thalamus since the latter lack sagittal plates. Thus it can be used as a guide for stereotactic placements in the thalamus by means of a recently developed technique that utilizes contrast ventriculography for the visualization of these landmarks. Key words: thalamic maps, intracerebral landmarks, cytoarchitecture. cnnnections of the motor thalamus, monkey The cytoarchitectonic atlas of the Mucaca nziilutta thalamus by Olszewski ('52) remains the best available and therefore the most widely used guide for identification of thalamic nuclei in monkeys. These limitations are understandable, as at the time when Olszewski proposed his classification, data on thalamic connections were insufficient. At the same time, cytological criteria when used alone are not always obvious enough to assure accurate delineation of many thalamic regions. In regard to the motor thalamus, the problem of identification of nuclear boundaries is especially pronounced, as has been acknowledged by many investigators in the field. During the last decade, the data on thalamic connectivity accumulated with modern neuroanatomical techniques have provided the necessary background to overcome the uncertainty in delineation of the motor thalamus and to reevaluate its nomenclature (for references see recent review by Kultas-Ilinsky and Ilinsky, '86). In fact, some modifications in the nomenclature have already been proposed in regard to the most lateroposterior region of the monkey motor thalamus that receives cerebellar projections (Asanuma et al., '83a,b). However, serial cytoarchitectonic maps either in frontal or other planes of section have been unavailable to aid in clarifying the delineations of the entire motor-related region in the light of the available experimental data, The main goal of the present study was to determine whether the demarcations of the subdivisions of the motor thalamus can be based on the distribution of nigral, pallidal, and cerebellar projections and how these outlines correlate with the cytoarchitecture. As a result of this approach we were able to introduce more rational delineations and nomenclature of the motor-related thalamic subdivisions, which are needed to clarify the long-existing confusion in regard to this large thalamic region. Delineations of all other thalamic nuclei in the figures are based on cytoarchitectonic distinctions as they appear in Nissl-stained preparations. The data on the organization of nigrothalamic projections were presented at length earlier (Ilinsky et al., '85); therefore only some new observations relevant to the demarcation of the motor thalamus have been included in this report. The data on pallido- and cerebellothalamic projections have not been previously reported other than in abstract form (Ilinsky and Kultas-Ilinsky, '82b, '84; Ilinsky, '86).

RESULTS The following description consists of two parts: (1) data obtained from our autoradiography experiments on the topography of basal ganglia and cerebellar aferents to the thalamus, with a brief review of literature concerning these projections, and (2) sagittal cytoarchitectonic maps with a description of the motor thalamic nuclei. The nuclei outside the motor thalamus were delineated according to cytoarchitectonic distinctions observed in sag- 10969861, 1987, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.902620303 by Rwth Aachen Hochschulbibliothe, Wiley Online Library on [12/09/2023]. It seemed important to present them together with motor nuclei in order to make the maps more complete and universal, especially since the available cytoarchitectonic atlases for the monkey thalamus lack sagittal plates (01- szewski, '52; Kusama and Mabuchi, '70). Topographical relationships between nigral, pallidal, and cerebellar projection zones in the motor thalamus of the rhesus monkey Nigral territory of the motor thalamus. Although nigrothalamic projections in primates and other species were demonstrated by many investigators using silver impregnation techniques (Cole et al., '64; Faull and Carman, '68; Carpenter and Peter, '721, this important output from the basal ganglia was accepted widely only after its autoradiographic confirmation by Carpenter et al. In the present study we used the results of our recent analysis of the topographic distribution of nigrothalamic projections that appeared elsewhere (Ilinsky et al., '85). Relevant to the goal of this study is our observation that the nigral projection zone in the motor thalamus corresponds in size to the whole extent of the magnocellular subdivision of the ventral anterior nucleus (VAmc). However, the question of whether the labeling observed in VM represents true synaptic terminals or dense concentration of labeled nigrothalamic fibers sectioned at odd angles remains unresolved. In any event, our data indicate that in primates VM does not represent the principal thalamic site receiving nigral afferents. The dorsal medial nucleus (MD), particularly its paralaminar part or pars multiformis (MDmf), is another recipient of nigrothalamic projections outside the traditionally recognized motor thalamus. It was established many years ago with the Marchi method that the medial segment of globus pallidus (GPm) projects to the thalamus via the ansa lenticularis and lenticular fasciculus (see Ranson and Ranson, '39; Hassler, '59). However, the full extent of pallidothalamic projections to specific thalamic nuclei, such as the VApc, VLo, VLm, and Ce, was elucidated in primates much later with the use of silver impregnation techniques (Nauta and Mehler, '66; Kuo and Carpenter, '73). In the thalamus, labeled pallidothalamic fibers formed a compact bundle that coursed anteriorly through the middle part of VM (VLm of Olszewski). Thus, our findings indicate that the entire pallidothalamic projection zone in the motor thalamus corresponds in size to the VApc and VAdc cytoarchitectonic subdivisions, and there is also a distinct mediolateral topography of these projections. In addition to the thalamic projections, dense silver grain accumulation was observed over the nucleus of lateral habenula (HL) and the pedunculopontine nucleus. Cerebellar tvrritorg of the motor thalamus. Distribution of cerebellothalamic projections in primates has been reinvestigated in a series of anatomical studies (Kievit and Kuypers, '72; Percheron, '77; Batton et al., '77; ChanPalay, '77; Stanton, '80; Kalil, '81; Asanuma et al., '83b). Despite some discrepancies that are largely due to arbitrary delineations of the motor nuclei and differences in nomenclature used, they all generally agree that the major recipients of cerebellar projections in the motor thalamus are VPLo, area X, VLc, and VLps according to Olszewski's terminology. Although this issue remains open, our study had a different goal that was limited to defining the position of the entire cerebellar territory within the intracerebral coordinate system in serial sagittal sections and its relation to the basal ganglia territory in the thalamus. Composite drawings demonstrating relationship nf nigral (open circles), pallidal (regular pattern of thin dots), and cerebellar (filled circles) projcction areas at different mediolateral levels of the thalamus. Despite variations in size and location of injection sites, the course and distribution of labeled fibers in the subthalamus and thalamus were remarkably consistent. Density of silver grains and the size of labeled zones over the thalamic nuclei varied depending on the volume of delivered radioactive material and location of the injection sites. Nevertheless, the general pattern of label distribution in the thalamus, at least in regard to projections from DN and IPA nuclei, was remarkably similar in all cases. These differences in the labeling pattern of the projection zone in medial and lateral VL regions are in direct correlation with the known topography of cerebellothalamic projections. projection zones is demonstrated in the composite diagram in Figure 2, and examples of autoradiographs of pallidal and cerebellar projections at two mediolateral thalamic levels are shown in Figure 3C,D and E,F.

Thus the present findings demonstrate the complementary topography of pallidal and cerebellar projection zones in the motor thalamus without any detectable overlap. Description of the sagittal thalamic maps with comments an the nuclear delineations and nomenclature The data on distribution of three major motor-related afferent systems upon distinct cytoarchitectonic entities allowed us to make accurate delineation of the monkey motor thalamus. Since our hodological data are limited to the motor thalamus, the outlines of all other nuclear subdivisions in the present figures are based solely on cytoarchitectonic distinctions revealed in serial Nisslstained sagittal sections. It should be mentioned that cytoarchitectonic distinctions were quite obvious for a majority of thalamic nuclei, and only in some cases were subdivisional boundaries less pronounced. As mentioned earlier, some nomenclature changes have been introduced in regard to the motor thalamus, whereas all other subdivisions maintain their traditional designations. Analysis of efferent-afferent connections of all thalamic subdivisions designated in our maps is beyond the scope of the present study, and for this topic readers are referred to the recent review on the thalamus by Jones ('85). The justification for the changes in nomenclature and subdivisional modifications given below concerns only the motor thalamus. Since laterally and posteriorly the thalamus moves away from the anterior comrnissure, we excluded parts of the most posterior and lateral thalamic nuclei such as pulvinar, and medial and lateral geniculate to keep the format of maps consistent and at the same time to demonstrate the zero frontal coordinate line in each figure. The VApc suhdzvision is situated along the anterior curvature of the thalamus adjacent to the external medullary lamina. The characteristic appearance of the VAmc cells and the niammillothalamic tract (MTT) that traverses this subdivision in its medial half allow for its easy identification. Photomicrographs of Nissl-stained serial sagittal sections through the thalamus with outlines of individual nuclei. The midline thalamic nuclei constitute the medial border of VAmc while the paracentral nucleus (Pen) and medial part of VL constitute its posterior border. From anterior, lateral, and some ventral aspects, VAmc is surrounded by VApc and VAdc, and dorsally it is limited by anterior ventral and anterior medial thalamic nuclei (AV and AM). The region designated VL occupies the most lateral position in the motor thalamus and is situated between the ventral anterior (VA) and ventral posterior (VP) nuclear groups (Figs. Nevertheless, precise demarcation of VLd on cytological grounds alone was not feasible and available data on the cerebellothalamic connectivity do not provide any keys for its further delineation, since cerebellothalamic fibers are distributed in the entire VL region including VLd. It corresponds basically to the thalamic area subdivided by Olszewski ('52) into four nuclei: area X, pars oralis of the ventroposterior lateral nucleus (VPLo), pars caudalis, and pars postrema of the ventral lateral nucleus (VLc and VLps). We prefer the term VM because cytoarchitecturally this area differs significantly from the VL region and topographically it is situated in the most ventromedial part of the anterior thalamus (Figs. The VM region in monkeys is rather inconspicuous cytoarchitecturally and can be considered an intermediate zone between subthalamus and thalamus. It is also important to mention that nigral, pallidal, and some cerebellar fibers (those destined to the medial VL) are topographically organized in the VM region so that nigrothalamic fibers are distributed in the most medial part of the VM, fibers from the GPm are concentrated in its middle part, and the cerebellothalamic fibers are located in the most posterior and lateral parts. Overlap between basal ganglia and cerebellar projections in the monkey thalamus was indicated in earlier studies (Nauta and Mehler, '66; Kemp and Powell, '71; Mehler, '71; Mehler and Nauta, '74). Although more recent studies did not support this view (Percheron, '77; Asanuma et al., '83b; Schell and Strick, '84; Ilinsky et al., '85), no direct evidence was provided to clarify topogyaphical relationships of these motor-related subcortical afferent systems in thc primate thalamus. The results ohtained in the present study clearly demonstrate the complete segregation of these motor-related systems and their relationship to well-defined cytoarchitectonic entities in the monkey thalamus. These findings allowed us to introduce a more rational and conceptually more consistent nomenclature of the motor thalamic nuclei in the primates. Under this classification we divide the motor thalamus of the rhesus monkey into two major territories: the ventral anterior region (VA) that receives projections from basal ganglia (SNr and GPm) and the ventral lateral region (VL) that receives projections from the cerebellum. In addition to the cerebellothalamic projections, the VL region in monkeys also receives some spinothalamic and vestibulothalamic projections (Asanuma et al., '83b). The ventral medial nucleus (VM) can be considered an intermediate or transitional zone between subthalamus and motor thalamus where fibers from basal ganglia and cerebellum are organized in topographically distinct bundles before entering their thalamic destinations. Surprisingly little is known about this most ventral thalamic subdivision in primates. After studies by Carpenter and his colleagues (Kuo and Carpenter, '73; Kim et al., '76; Carpenter et al., '76) it has become a generally accepted view that VM (VLm) is the site of the primate motor thalamus receiving projections from basal ganglia. This implies that VM should be included in basal ganglia territory of the primate thalamus together with the VA region. Although we cannot deny that some basal ganglia fibers may terminate in the VM, our findings indicate that this area is quite different from the VA region, and it certainly is not a major recipient of either nigrothalamic or pallidothalamic projections. ILINSKY AND K. KULTAS-IIJNSKY the motor thalamus with resultant changes in topographical relationships between pallidal, nigral, and cerebellar projection zones. Therefore we believe that to resolve the question of homologies more data on thalamocortical connections are required. The nomenclature of the primate motor thalamus varies among different authors (Table 2). This was done deliberately to emphasize the point that this subdivision is a part of the basal ganglia territory in the primate thalamus in contrast to the VL region. Previous studies stressed the anteroposterior topography of pallidothalamic fibers (Kuo and Carpenter, '73; Kim et al., '76). The third, magnocellular nucleus of the VA region (VAmc) receives nigrothalamic projections that also demonstrate mediolateral topography within its confines (Ilinsky et al., '85). The main goal of our experiments on the distribution of cerebellothalamic projections was to clarify the topogaphic relationship between basal ganglia and cerebellar projection zones in the primate thalamus. Our findings are in agreement with earlier data (Percheron, '77; Stanton, '80; Kalil, '81; Asanuma et al., '83b) indicating that projections from deep cerebellar nuclei are distributed in overlapping fashion in the VL thalamic region that corresponds to the Olszewski VPLo, area X, VLc, and VLps subdivisions. However, the entire region of the motor thalamus receiving cerebellar projections is quite homogeneous cytoarchitectonically: thus the delineations made by Olszewski ('52) are not easy to reproduce in experimental material. The recently postulated view (Schell and Strick, '84; Ilinsky et al., '85; Alexander et al., '86) that nigral, pallidal, and cerebellar afferents in primates establish their own segregated channels in the so-called specific or relay thalamic nuclei to reach neocortex is directly supported by the present study. It is also well known that the main destination of the cerebellothalamocortical pathway (via VL as the relay) is area 4 of the primary motor cortex. Thus, one can see that in primates the mediolateral sequence in distribution of nigro-, pallido-, and cerebellothalamic fibers is reflected in the anteroposterior topography of cortical projections from the respective motor thalamic relays. This is not in complete agreement with long-standing views (see also Jones et al., '79; Tracey et al., '80) that the cerebellothalamocortical pathway projects exclusively to area 4. The most recent reinvestigations of cerebellothalamocortical connections in primates indicate that the posterior portions of the deep cerebellar nuclei via medial VL region project to the premotor cortex whereas anterior parts of cerebellar nuclei via lateral VL region project to the primary motor cortex (Stanton, '80; Schell and Strick, '84; Wiesendanger and Wiesendanger, '85a,b). Thus, there is a reason to believe that both basal ganglia and cerebellum control thalamic output to the premotor as well as primary motor cortices. Obviously, some additional data on thalamocortical projections from the basal ganglia and cerebellar territories of the primate motor thalamus are needed before any conceptual conclusions are drawn. In this regard the present maps, with accurate delineation of subcortical relay stations in the thalamus, can be instrumental for further elucidating functional circuits linking basal ganglia and cerebellum with the neocortex. Another novel aspect of the maps presented here is that the cytoarchitectonic distinctions of the thalamus are demonstrated in the sagittal plane, whereas other available guides of the monkey thalamus utilize frontal plane only. Moreover, this atlas utilizes the same intracerebral coordinate system as the most widely used stereotactic atlases of the human brain (Talairach, '57; Schaltenbrand and Baily, '63; Schaltenbrand and Wahren, ""77; Hassler et al., '79) and thus they can be useful for future comparative studies in establishing homologues of thalamic nuclei in various primate species. Another advantage of the maps is that they can be used for stereotactic surgery on the monkey thalamus in conjunction with a recently developed highly accurate stereotactic technique (Per&eron, '75; Ilinsky et al., '80; Ilinsky and Kultas-Ilinsky, '82a) that is based on the same intracerebral coordinate system as human brain atlases.

The topography in fiber distribution was noted in that the medially placed injections resulted in preferential labeling of fibers in ansa lenticularis whereas the lenticular fasciculus was more intensely labeled after laterally placed injections. Laterally placed injections in the GPm resulted in dense labeling of densicellular subdivision of VA (VAdc) and Ce. The labeling after these injections in the parvicellular subdivision (VApc) was more 10969861, 1987, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.902620303 by Rwth Aachen Hochschulbibliothe, Wiley Online Library on [12/09/2023]. In contrast, the entire VApc was labeled when the injection sites involved the most medial part of the GPm. For this, isotope injections in the cerebellum were made in four monkeys. Three received unilateral injections and one bilateral injections into deep cerebellar nuclei. Data on the concentration and amount of the isotope as well as the locations of injection sites are given in Table 1, and an example of an injection site in the dentate nucleus (DN) is demonstrated in Figure 3B. The largest injection covered the anterior two-thirds of the DN throughout its mediolatera1 extent, leaving its most posterior part free of label.

Thus, the lateral VL region was labeled almost completely as a result of tracer injections in the anterior half of the DN.

Keywords Thalamus Nociception Ventrobasal complex Monkey 1 Introduction The nucleus ventralis posterior (VP) of the monkey's thalamus consists of four parts: nucleus ventralis posteromedialis (VPM), nucleus ventralis posteromedialis parvocellularis (VPMpc), nucleus ventralis posterolateralis (VPL) and nucleus ventralis posterior inferior (VPI). The ventrobasal (VB) complex of the thalamus comprises somatosensory parts of the nucleus ventralis posterior. It is widely accepted that there are nociceptive specific (NS) and wide dynamic range (WDR) neurons in the VB complex of mammalian thalamus (Kenshalo et al. Acraniotomy was performed on the right side to allow introduction of a recording microelectrode into the thalamus. Glass capillary microelectrodes filled with 4% pontamine sky blue in 0.5 M sodium acetate were used to record single unit activity in the thalamus. The thalamus was explored by making rows of microelectrode penetrations in Horsley-Clarke frontal planes. Once well-isolated unitary activity had been recorded from the thalamus, the somatic receptive field of the unit was examined and mapped using mechanical stimuli. For thalamic units that responded to mechanical stimuli in the noxious range, a graded radiant heat stimulus was, if accessible, applied to the skin near the center of the receptive field as determined by mechanical stimulation. Abbreviations used in photomicrographs are as follows: CL, nucleus centralis lateralis; CM, nucleus centrum medianum; GL, corpus geniculatum laterale; GM, corpus geniculatum mediale; LP, nucleus lateralis posterior; MD, nucleus medialis dorsalis; PuO, nucleus pulvinaris oralis; R, nucleus reticularis thalami; Ret, formatio reticularis; VPI, nucleus ventralis posterior inferior; VPLc, nucleus ventralis posterolateralis, pars caudalis; VPM, nucleus ventralis posteromedialis. Peripheral receptive field organizations of these two classes of thalamic nociceptive neurons were much the same as those of their counterparts in the spinal cord or trigeminal subnucleus caudalis. In the previous studies, segregation of LTM and nociceptive neurons within the thalamus was less clear in the monkey than in the cat, but most studies show a tendency for nociceptive neurons to be unevenly distributed across the VB complex (Kenshalo et al., 1980 Casey and Morrow, 1983 Chung et al., 1986 Bushnell and Duncan, 1987 Morrow and Casey, 1992 Bushnell et al., 1993). Anatomically, there are species differences in the organization of the somatosensory thalamus. Some studies of primate spinothalamic tract terminations suggest that there are clusters of dense terminations near the borders of VPL (Boivie 1979, Berkley 1980), whereas other studies of primate spino- and trigeminothalamic tract have found diffuse terminations throughout the ventroposterior thalamus (Ganchrow 1978, Appelbaum et al. This has been one of the bases of the rod-to-column principle of thalamocortical organization (Jones et al., 1982). Hence, nociceptive neurons appear to be exceptions of the rod-to-column thalamocortical organization. This border forms a curving line across the rostral and dorsal VP thalamus causing the input from deep tissues to sit as a cap on the central core of VP. Rose and Mountcastle (1952)studied tactile representation within the VP nucleus in rabbits and cats and argued that several of the ventroposterior thalamic nuclei together formed a single and complete representation of the contralateral body surface, and could be subsumed under a more inclusive term, the ventrobasal (VB) complex. Clinical, physiological and anatomical evidence implicates various regions of the thalamus in pain perception (Albe-Fessard et al.

GOLDMAN-RAKIC Section of Neuroanatomy, Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, Connecticut 06510 ABSTRACT The nigrothalamocortical connections and their topography were analyzed by autoradiography and double or triple retrograde labeling with the fluorescent dyes Fast Blue, Diamidino Yellow, and Propidium Iodide. Injections of tritiated leucine into different parts of the substantia nigra (SN) revealed that the medial SN projects to the medial magnocellular subdivisions of the ventral anterior (VAmc) and mediodorsal (MDmc) nuclei of the thalamus while the lateral SN projects to the more lateral and more posterior part of the VAmc, and the paralaminar, parvicellular, and densocellular subdivisions of the mediodorsal nucleus (MDmf, MDpc, and MDdc). Analysis of the thalamus in cases with fluorescent dye injections into the lateral orbital gyrus (Walker's area ll), principal sulcus (area 46), anterior bank of the arcuate gyrus (areas 8 and 451, supplementary motor area (area 6), and motor cortex (area 4) revealed topographic organization of the nigrothalamocortical projection system. These findings indicate that the SN has preferential targets in the thalamus and cerebral cortex which are segregated from those of the globus pallidus and cerebellum. Key words: substantia nigra, thalamus, frontal lobe, monkey, autoradiography, fluorescent labeling The substantia nigra (SN) is generally considered to be involved in the control of movement through its connections both with the neostriatum and the thalamus (for review see Dray '80; Mehler, '81). Although the thalamus is also regarded as a major target of projections from the pars reticulata (SNr) in various species including primates (Faull and Mehler, '78; Bentivoglio et al., '79; Beckstead, '83), topographic aspects of SN0 1985 ALAN R. LISS, INC. thalamic connections are not well understood nor has there been a detailed analysis of the nigrothalamocortical system as a whole. Previous studies have demonstrated that the SN in nonhuman primates projects to specific zones of the ventral anterior WA), ventral lateral NL), and medial dorsal (MD) thalamic nuclei (Carpenter and Peter, '72; Carpenter et al., '76) and certain portions of the VA as well as MD project to Accepted February 6, 1985. It is not clear from these earlier studies whether all parts of the SN are equally represented in VA, VL, and MD thalamic nuclei. Ikther, the extent to which the relevant thalamocortical projections originate from precisely the same thalamic subdivisions innervated by the SN remains to be established. The present study was designed to answer these questions by identifying precisely the regions in the macaque thalamus that receive projections from medial and lateral parts of the SN and to determine the specific areas of the frontal lobe that are connected to these thalamic regions. Anterograde transport of tritiated leucine was employed to trace nigral efferents while thalamocortical projections were studied by means of double and triple retrograde labeling using fluorescent tracers injected simultaneously into different regions of the neocortex. For examination of thalamocortical connections fluorescent dyes were injected into different areas of the frontal lobe following craniectomy. The sagittal plane was chosen since it is particularly favorable for identifying cytoarchitectonic boundaries of motor-related thalamic nuclei (Percheron, '77; Asanuma et al., '83a), and additionally, basal ganglia and cerebellar projections are segregated along the anterior-posterior axis in various species including man (Ilinsky and Kultas-Ilinsky, '84a,b; Hassler, '59). The use of both hemispheres is fully justified by the homolateral organization of thalamocortical projections. Analysis of the results Photomicrographs of autoradiographs and Nissl-stained sections from fluorescent tracer experiments were printed at a final magnification matching that of computer microscope charts showing the distribution of thalamocortical neurons. Transparent acetate film sheets were overlaid on photomicrographs of Nissl sections to outline the boundaries of thalamic nuclei and on darkfield autoradiographs to outline the terminal territories of nigral projections. The CA-CP line was used to keep the overlays in register when comparing the outlines of thalamic nuclei and location of labeled zones in different experiments. The distributions of thalamocortical neurons labeled with fluorescent dyes were charted on a semiautomatic computerized Leitz Dialux-20 fluorescent microscope with its stage equipped with Minnesota Datametrics readout heads. After plotting, the sections were counterstained with cresyl violet for identification of thalamic nuclei. RESULTS Cytoarchitectural delineation of the ventral anterior thalamic region Representative photomicrographs of sagittal sections demonstrating cytoarchitectural boundaries within the ventral anterior region of the monkey thalamus are shown in Figures 1 and 2. The ventral anterior nucleus NA), which consists of magnocellular (VAmc) and parvicellular (VA proper) parts, is a prominent nucleus in the lateral thalamus. The midline thalamic nuclei constitute the medial border of the VAmc while its posterior border is formed by the paracentral nucleus (Pcn) at sagittal levels 1.2-2.0 mm (Fig. The mammillothalamic tract (M?T), which traverses the VAmc at this level, is an additional reliable landmark for identification of this subdivision. The dorsal boundary of the VAmc is formed by the anterior medial and anterior ventral thalamic nuclei (AM and AV), while the pars oralis and pars medialis of the ventral lateral nucleus (VLo and VLm) form its ventral boundary (Figs.

However, labeled terminal zones were detected in the thalamus only in those three animals in which injection sites were located in the anterior half of the SN (cases #1, 5, 6). Following posterior SN injections, a few scattered fibers were detected in Forels fields heading toward the thalamus, but no terminal labeling was observed in any thalamic nuclei, except for some weak labeling in the centromedianum-parafascicular complex (Ce-Pf). Since the topographic distribution of nigrostriatal, nigrotectal, and nigrotegmental projections is beyond the scope of this paper, the following description of the nigrothalamic pathway will be based mainly on the results of the three injections in the anterior part of the SN (Fig. Course of nigruthalamir fibers. The labeled fibers destined for the thalamus emerge from the SN at all mediolatera1 levels and entirely fill Forels fields. The anterior contingent of nigrothalamic fibers enters the thalamus in a diffuse manner passing through the VLm and ventral aspects of the VA (see levels 1.2-2.2 mm in Fig. Terminal projection zones of the nigrothalamic pathway. The thalamic nuclei that contained labeling following ipsilateral injections of the SN included the VAmc, VLm, MD, and Ce-Pf complex, though among these nuclei the density and distribution of autoradiographic grains varied. Other thalamic nuclei such as VLm and Ce-Pf also contained label; however, the density of silver grains was significantly lower compared to that in VAmc and MD and the distribution pattern was quite different. Some labeled fibers were occasionally seen in the contralateral thalamus, but no clear terminal areas were detected in any of our experiments.

FB labeled neurons were also found beyond the VAmc cytoarchitectonic boundaries, anteriorly in the VA proper, and medially in the midline thalamic nuclei. In all cases of PS as well as orbital cortex injections, some labeled neurons were also seen in the VA proper and midline thalamic nuclei.

Other sources of thalamocortical projections. Injections in the orbital and PS prefrontal regions labeled a number of cells throughout the anterior-posterior extent of the thalamus. In the anterior thalamus many positive cells were observed in the anterior medial nucleus (AM). The central lateral nucleus (CLn), which is situated more laterally in the thalamus compared to the Pcn, contained neurons labeled from the SMA as well as from the hand area of the primary motor cortex. DISCUSSION The main goal of the present study was to elucidate the anatomical organization of the nigrothalamocortical system of the monkey, especially the topographical relationships between its nigrothalamic and thalamocortical components. Our results indicate that this system is made up of at least two distinct ascending projections: (1) a medial pathway which originates in the medial part of the SNr and forms a dense terminal field in the medial part of the VAmc as well as several circumscribed terminal clusters in the MDmc; thalamocortical neurons located in these areas project to the anterior frontal association cortex, preferentially to the orbital cortex and principal sulcus; (2) a lateral pathway which originates in the lateral part of the SNr and forms a dense terminal field throughout the MDmf, the lateral part of the VAmc, as well as several small terminal clusters in the MDpc, and MDdc; thalamocortical neurons in these areas project to the more posterior and dorsal parts of the frontal lobe-FEF, SMA, as well as to the principal sulcal cortex. Charts of labeled neurons at different sagittal levels of the thalamus resulting from FB injections in the orbital cortex (case #9). Organization of SN projection zones and their relation to specific cytoarchitectonic subdivisions of the thalamus Although several earlier studies in primates have been concerned with efferent projections of the SN using degeneration techniques (Cole et al., '64; Mettler, '70; Carpenter and Peter, '72), to our knowledge only one employed autoradiography to specifically address the distribution of nigral projections in the monkey thalamus (Carpenter et al., '76). In the present study we confirmed the findings of Carpenter and his colleagues ('76) that the VAmc and MDmf are major recipients of nigrothalamic projections. Moreover, our findings emphasize that the projection zones of the SN correspond in size to the full extent of these two distinct cytoarchitectonic subdivisions of the thalamus. The main point of difference between the present findings and the earlier studies is with respect to the VLm as a major recipient of nigrothalamic projections. Although we cannot rule out that some nigral fibers terminate in the VLm, since a few dense clusters of silver grains were observed in its medial region, this nucleus does not seem to represent the main terminal area of the nigrothalamic pathway. The issue of whether the labeling observed in the Ce-Pf complex and in the VLm represents true synaptic terminals of nigrothalamic fibers can only be resolved by electron microscopy. Thus, the nigral input to the various subdivisions of MD may be organized in a manner similar to the distribution pattern of different cortical afferent systems in the striatum (Goldman and Nauta, '77; Goldman-Rakic, '81, '83) and may be related to cell clusters observed in the distribution of thalamocortical neurons in the MD (Goldman-Rakic and Porrino, '85). Cortical connections of the thalamic areas receiving SN afferents The results of our retrograde-tracing experiments have revealed that VAmc neurons project to at least three distinct areas of the neocortex-the frontal association cortex, the frontal eye field (FEF), and the supplementary motor area @MA)-and that they are organized topographically in relation to their cortical destination. In spite of possible overlap between different cell groups, our double- and triple-labeling experiments indicate that these and other thalamocortical neurons represent separate and distinct neuronal populations since double-labeled cells are rarely encountered. Charts of labeled neurons at different sagittal levels of the thalamus resulting from ipsilateral injections of PI in both banks of the PS, FB in the SMA, and DY in primary motor cortex (case #7), Injection sites are shown in Figure 9A. Charts of labeled neurons at different sagittal levels of the thalamus resulting from FB injections in the FEF (case #9). The connection between another nigral territory in the thalamus, the paralaminar part of MD (MDmf of 01- szewski, '521, and the FEF has been recognized since the pioneering work of Walker ('40a). General organization of the nigrothalamocortical system When comparing the available data on the organization of subcorticocortical pathways relayed through the motor thalamus in primates, several conclusions can be drawn. First, projections from the substantia nigra, globus pallidus, and deep cerebellar nuclei have their own completely segregated territories in the thalamus (Carpenter et al., '76; Kim et al., '76; Percheron, '77; Asanuma et al., '83b; Ilinsky and Kultas-Ilinsky, '84a). Second, the cerebellothalamocortical system may be the most specific in the sense that the cerebellar terminal zone in the thalamus (VPLo, VLc and ""area X"") projects almost exclusively to the primary motor cortex (for review see Asanuma et al., '83b). The pallidothalamocortical system is somewhat more diffuse in that pallidal projections reach cytoarchitectonically quite different nuclear groups in the thalamus (VA proper, VLo, and the Ce-Pf complex) which in turn project to premotor as well as primary motor areas of the neocortex (Kim et al., '76; Kievit and Kuypers, '77; DeVito and Anderson, '82; Ilinsky and Kultas-Ilinsky, '84a; Schell and Strick, '84). Finally, as demonstrated in this study, the nigrothalamic pathway also terminates in several thalamic nuclei (VAmc, MDmf, MDmc, MDpc) whose connections with the frontal lobe are still more widespread, projecting as they do to large areas of the dorsolateral and orbital frontal association cortex, the frontal eye field, as well as the supplementary motor area. It should be noted that the latter projection overlaps only partially with the massive input to the SMA from the pallidal zone of the thalamus (Schell and Strick, '84). In this context, the relationship and organization of the two basal ganglia output systems are quite different in primates compared to nonprimate species, since in the latter they overlap extensively in the thalamus (Hendry et al., '79; Ilinsky et al., '82b). Possibly the segregation of the basal ganglia output systems at both thalamic and cortical levels is an important evolutionary specialization of the primate species. Implications for functional neurology of movement The results of the present study indicate that the SN influences the anterior prefrontal cortex via the medial nigrothalamic pathway while the lateral nigrothalamic pathway influences the more posterior prefrontal and medial premotor areas of the neocortex. The present findings, together with other available data (Kunzle and Akert, '77; Harting et al., '80) provide an anatomical basis for physiological mechanisms of oculomotor and orofacial control and more specifically suggest that the lateral component of the nigrothalamocortical system is particularly relevant to this function. In this regard, it is striking that the two thalamic nuclei WAmc and MDmf) which receive prominent projections from the lateral SN are also innervated from the superior colliculus (Harting et al., '80) which itself is connected with the frontal eye field (Kunzle and Akert, '77). The medial pathway of the nigrothalamocortical system appears to have its selective influence on the more anterior regions of the frontal lobe, e.g., the principal sulcus and orbital cortex. The medial component of the nigrothalamocortical pathway described here may serve as a very important link between the dopaminergic and nondopaminergic systems. Faull, R.L.M., and W.R.

Anterograde transport of tritiated leucine was employed to trace nigral efferents while thalamocortical projections were studied by means of double and triple retrograde labeling using fluorescent tracers injected simultaneously into different regions of the neocortex. After trephination of the skull, injections of tritiated leucine into the SN were placed stereotacticaliy using an intracerebral coordinate system and ventriculography with a water-soluble contrast substance, Amipaque Winthrop). For examination of thalamocortical connections fluorescent dyes were injected into different areas of the frontal lobe following craniectomy. 'I s ipnil;rtrml injections Injectionh tn thr left hrrnisphere. Autoradiography Experimental animals (cases # 1-6, Table 1) received injections of 4,5-3[H]-leucine (ICN) in a final concentration of 50-75 pCi/pL into different parts of the SN. The isotope was reconstituted in sterile saline and delivered through a Hamilton microsyringe with the total injected volume varying in different experiments from 0.6 to 1.5 pL. Experiments with fluorescent tracers In two monkeys (cases # 7 and # 8, Table 1) injections of three fluorescent dyes (Fast Blue, Diamidino Yellow, and Propidium Iodide) were made in different cortical areas in the same hemisphere. Fast Blue (FB; concentration 570, Illing, KG) was injected into the supplementary motor cortex and Diamidino Yellow dihydrochloride (DY; concentration 2%; Illing, KG )was injected into the hand area of the primary motor cortex 7 days before perfusion. Propidium Iodide (PI; concentration 3%; Sigma) was injected into both the dorsal and ventral banks of the principal sulcus in one of these monkeys (case #7) and into only the dorsal bank of the principal sulcus in the other monkey (case # 8) 2 days before perfusion. In a third monkey (case #9) FB was injected into the orbital cortex and DY was injected into the dorsal bank of the principal sulcus in the left hemisphere; in the right hemisphere, the frontal eye field and the ventral bank of the principal sulcus were injected with FB and DY, respectively. Multiple injections of the three fluorescent tracers were made in each of the targeted cortical areas at 10969861, 1985, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.902360304 by Rwth Aachen Hochschulbibliothe, Wiley Online Library on [12/09/2023]. Altogether eight to 12 injections were made in each cortical zone with 0.5-1.0 p1 of dye delivered at each penetration. The injection rate (0.1 pl per minute) was controlled using a Harvard microliter syringe pump. Thalamic connnections of the substantia nigra Description of radiolabeled injection sites. In these animals both SNc and SNr were included in the injection site due to their intercalation throughout the SN. However, labeled terminal zones were detected in the thalamus only in those three animals in which injection sites were located in the anterior half of the SN (cases #1, 5, 6). In three other animals, the injection sites were located in the posterior part of the SN (cases #2, 3, 4). Labeled fibers leaving these injection sites coursed anteriorly, swept around the pallidum, and then continued within the internal capsule to terminate throughout the caudate and putamen. Following posterior SN injections, a few scattered fibers were detected in Forels fields heading toward the thalamus, but no terminal labeling was observed in any thalamic nuclei, except for some weak labeling in the centromedianum-parafascicular complex (Ce-Pf). Since the topographic distribution of nigrostriatal, nigrotectal, and nigrotegmental projections is beyond the scope of this paper, the following description of the nigrothalamic pathway will be based mainly on the results of the three injections in the anterior part of the SN (Fig. The mediolateral extent of the injection sites differed in these three animals. Our most lateral injection (case # 1) occupied the mediolateral region between 5.0 and 7.0 mm (Figs. Another injection extended from 4.0 and 6.0 mm (Fig. This posterior bundle is more pronounced following laterally placed SN injections, while the anterior group is denser in the cases with more medial SN injections. The thalamic nuclei that contained labeling following ipsilateral injections of the SN included the VAmc, VLm, MD, and Ce-Pf complex, though among these nuclei the density and distribution of autoradiographic grains varied.

The location and extent of the projection zone varied for different injection sites in the SN. Lateral injections of the SN labeled terminals throughout the posterior and lateral portions of the VAmc (Fig. 5), while medial injections of the SN gave rise to a continuous terminal zone throughout the medial part of the VAmc (Fig. The mediodorsal nucleus (MD) contained dense aggregations of silver grains in different subdivisions depending on the injection site in the SN. In particular, the most lateral SN injection (case #1) resulted in very dense labeling of the paralaminar part of the MD. In addition to the MDmf projections, several clustered arrangements of silver grains were scattered throughout the MDpc and MDdc following the most lateral SN injection (Fig. None of these subdivisions (MDmf, MDpc, and MDdc) contained label after more medial SN injections.

Such labeling was found in the ventral posterior part of the Pf following the most lateral SN injection (Fig. 5), while after medial SN injections the labeled zone extended farther anteriorly involving in addition a small ventral portion of the Ce. Faint labeling in the Ce-Pf was also observed following injections in the posterior part of the SN (cases # 2, # 3, # 4).

The FB injection into the supplementary motor area (SMA) in the same case was smaller and also charaterized by needle tracks surrounded by bright fluorescent zones (Fig. The DY injection sites in the primary motor cortex were small, irregular in shape, and confined to the middle portion of the anterior bank of the central sulcus (Fig. Some of the injections in the motor area penetrated into the underlying white matter. Evaluation of injections sites in case # 8 (Fig. 9D) revealed similar uptake and location of fluorescent dyes in the prefrontal, supplementary motor, and motor cortical areas with the exception of the PI which was injected only in the dorsal bank of PS. In case #9, the FB and DY injection sites were restricted, respectively, to the frontal eye field (FEF) and ventral bank of the PS in one hemisphere (Fig. Retrogradely labeled neurons were found in VAmc following injections into all cortical areas but the motor cortex. Following FB injections in the orbital cortex (case #9), numerous retrogradely labeled neurons occupied the medial part of the VAmc at sagittal levels between 0.7 and 2.5 mm from the midline (Fig. After PI injections into both banks of PS (Fig. 11) labeled cells were also observed in the medial portion of VAmc, though they extended more dorsally and laterally than neurons labeled from orbital cortex injections. However, small DY injections in the dorsal bank of PS in one hemisphere and in the ventral bank in another hemisphere (case # 9) did not provide any clear-cut indication that neurons targeting different banks of the PS had widely separate origins within the VAmc. In all cases of PS as well as orbital cortex injections, some labeled neurons were also seen in the VA proper and midline thalamic nuclei. Retrogradely labeled neurons in the VAmc were also observed after FB injections in the frontal eye field (FEF). In this case, FB labeled cells occupied more lateral levels of the VAmc than neurons labeled from injections in the orbital cortex (Fig. Darkfield autoradiographs of sagittal sections at different mediolateral levels demonstrating projection zones in the thalamus and the course of nigral fibers in the diencephalon following the most lateral SN injection (Case #l).

A variable number of fluorescent neurons were found in one or more subdivision of the MD following dye injections in all five cortical areas studied. Injections in the orbital cortex and PS labeled a large number of cells in both MDmc and MDpc, with a preponderance of neurons in the MDmc following the orbital injection and in the MDpc following PS injections (Figs. Separate injections confined, respectively, to the dorsal and ventral bank of the PS (case #9) revealed that neurons projecting to the dorsal bank were concentrated in the dorsal region of the MD while those to the ventral bank were observed in the ventral region of the MD. A few scattered labeled neurons were also found in the medial part of MDmf from injections in both PS and orbital cortex. In sharp contrast, injections in the FEF resulted in dense labeling throughout the entire mediolateral extent of the MDmf as well as in the most anterior part of the MD (Fig. Labeled cells were found in the VLm after injections in the motor cortex, SMA, and the orbital region of the prefrontal cortex, but not after injections in either or both banks of the PS. lo), while the lateral region of this nucleus was occupied by cells labeled following motor and premotor cortical injections (Fig. Following injections into the primary motor cortex, a considerable number of labeled cells were found in the VLm. Midline nuclei, such as reuniens (Re) and central laterocellular (CLc), also contained labeled cells especially following orbital cortex injections. Numerous dye-containing neurons were observed in the medial regions of pulvinar complex (Pul) and lateral posterior nucleus (LP) after fluorescent dye injections in all regions of the prefrontal cortex studied here (Figs.

X70 virtually no labeled cells were observed following PS injections. Greater numbers of labeled neurons were observed in this nuclear complex after injections in the supplementary and primary motor cortical areas (Fig. The cells labeled by SMA injections were located preferentially in the dorsal region of the Ce with only a few extending into Pf, while those labeled from the primary motor cortex were found only in the ventrolateral part of the Ce. Within other intralaminar nuclei, a few labeled cells were occasionally seen in the paracentral nucleus (Pcn) following prefrontal cortex injections. In contrast, SMA injections resulted in numerous labeled neurons uniformly distributed throughout Pcn and also the central superior nucleus (Cs). The number of cells in area X was greater after injections in the SMA while cells labeled from the primary motor cortex were located predominantly in the VPLo. A.

These data suggest that quality coding of gustatory information in the thalamus is not radically different from that seen among lower-order neurons in other species. The average breadth of responsiveness of the 50 thalamic neurons as described by the entropy coefficient was 0.73. The presence of these nongustatory neurons within the thalamic taste area suggests that the traditional characterization of VPMpc as a gustatory relay may understate its role in ingestive behavior and ignore other noningestive functions of the area. In our own experience, we have found neurons in gustatory thalamus and cortex to be more sensitive to the effects of general anesthesia than neurons located in adjacent somatosensory areas. In experiments with anesthetized or paralyzed rats, the neural coding properties of individual thalamic gustatory neurons have been found to differ substantially from those of brain stem neurons. In contrast to pontine, medullary, and peripheral neurons that respond vigorously and in a linear fashion to a logarithmic concentration series of sapid stimuli, thalamic neurons respond sluggishly and often in a nonmonotonic fashion ( 16,4 1). Response inhibition, which is not common among brain stem and peripheral neurons, occurs among 7-14s of thalamic neurons (40, 42). In the present experiment the neural coding characteristics of individual thalamic gustatory neurons were investigated in awake, behaving monkeys. Following electrophysiologicalocation of the oral trigeminal and gustatory thalamic areas, the chronic recording chamber was attached to the skull with dental acrylic. An indwelling glass-coated tungsten electrode (2 = 1 MQ @ 1 kHz) that served as an indifferent, was positioned as close to the gustatory thalamus as possible. The parvicellular division of the ventroposteromedial nucleus of the thalamus (VPMpc) is portrayed as a 2-dimensional sheet as viewed from above relative to ear bar zero (EBO) and the midsagittal plane. Electrophysiological recording and data analysis Glass-insulated tungsten electrodes with exposed tips of -8 X 12 pm (2 = OS- 1 .O Mfi) were used to isolate individual gustatory neurons in the parvicellular division of the ventroposteromedial nucleus of the thalamus (VPMpc).

DISCUSSION The data from the present experiment demonstrate that both spontaneous and evoked rates of activity of thalamic gustatory neurons are robust in the awake, behaving monkey. These data differ from those reported previously for medullary and cortical gustatory neurons in the alert monkey and from thalamic gustatory neurons in the anesthetized and paralyzed rat (40, 42-44). The spontaneous rate of the thalamic neurons described in the present report was 9.4 spikes/s, also higher than that reported for thalamic gustatory neurons in the anesthetized or paralyzed rat (27, 40, 42). In our experience, we have found neurons in thalamic and cortical gustatory areas to be more sensitive to barbiturate or halothane anesthesia than neurons located only 1 mm away in oral somatosensory areas. For example, in the medulla the breadth of tuning of gustatory neurons is 0.87 (43); in the thalamus, the average entropy value is 0.73. In the present report, a subset of narrowly tuned sucrose-best neurons (H = 0.56) was found in the taste thalamus, but these cells were not examined under varying degrees of satiety. In rodent, the average entropy values for gustatory neurons in the medulla, pons, thalamus, and cortex are 0.66, 0.65, 0.60, and 0.54, respectively.2 The monkey and rodent entropy values are similar for neurons in the primary cortical gustatory areas, but differ substantially for medullary neurons (0.87 vs. 0.66, respectively). All 3 criteria indicate that thalamic gustatory neurons are not as broadly tuned as the entropy measure suggests. (50); pans, Van Buskirk and Smith (5 1); thalamus, Nomura and Ogawa (27); cortex, Yamamoto et al. Two recent reports in rat by Cechetto and Saper (7, 8) have shown that neurons in the parvicellular region of the ventrobasal thalamus receive general visceral afferent information and project to areas of cortex that process similar information. This area of the ventrobasal thalamus, designated VPLpc by the authors, is located immediately lateral to the taste area, but is cytoarchitectonically indistinguishable from it and differs in both its afferent supply and efferent projections. It is not known whether this thalamic general visceral relay in rat has a homologue in subhuman primates. Just as in the periphery and brain stem of rodents, some thalamic gustatory neurons show side-band sensitivity to thermal and tactile stimulation of the oral cavity. This does not necessarily mean that gustatory neurons represent a minority within VPMpc, the so-called thalamic taste area, but it is clear that the nucleus receives heterogeneous afferent information. The presence of complex anticipatory, sensory-motor neurons within the thalamic taste area also suggests that the traditional characterization of VPMpc as a gustatory relay Downloaded from journals.physiology.org/journal/jn at RWTH Aachen Hochschulbibliothek (134.061.068.122) on September 12, 2023. The role of similar complex cells within VPMpc will be more difficult to decipher unless we consider the possibility that the taste thalamus may be more than a simple staging area for gustatory cortex.

The study examines the nature of the influence that the basal ganglia exert on frontal cortex via the motor nuclei of the thalamus. Bilateral lesions were then placed in the ventral thalamus. Key words: Thalamus - Basal ganglia - Motor learning - Akinesia - Monkey Introduction The basal ganglia influence frontal cortex via the thalamus. Recent studies have clarified the details of the projections from basal ganglia to thalamus (Kim et al. 1985), and from thalamus to cortex (Schell and Strick 1984: Ilinsky and Kultas-Ilinsky 1987). Delong and colleagues have stressed the fact that through the thalamus the basal ganglia can influence not just areas 4 and 6 but also prefrontal and cingulate cortex (Delong and Georgopoulos 1981). Each frontal subarea sends a projection to a specific area of the striatum; and in turn each area receives an indirect projection from the globus pallidus via ventral and dorsomedial thalamus (Alexander et al. The basal ganglia influence both these cortical areas, though the exact details of the thalamic relay are not fully worked out. The details of the projections from thalamus to the premotor areas are less well established. (1988) have used electrophysiological methods to study cells in the ventral thalamus that receive an inhibitory input from the globus pallidus; their figure shows that of 12 such cells projecting to the dorsal premotor area 7 were in VApc. This is distinct from the region of thalamus to which the cerebellar nuclei project: this includes the nuclei designated by Olszewski (1952) as nucleus X, VPLo and VLc (Jones 1985; Ilinsky and Kultas-Ilinsky 1987). The details of the anatomical connections from basal ganglia to thalamus suggest one way in which we could test the influence of the basal ganglia on cortex. In the first (experiment one) bilateral lesions were placed with a radiofrequency probe in the basal ganglia territory of the thalamus. The estimation was based on preliminary experiments on the distance between the sphenoid bone and the mammillothalamic tract (MTT). Figures I a and b show 6 cross-sections through the thalamus for each animal. MTT=mammillothalamic tract, MB= Mammillary body, MD =nucleus medialis dorsalis, RET N = nucleus reticularis.

The degeneration in MD in monkeys 41, 42 and 43 was due to the fact that the fibres from MD course forwards through the medial thalamus, and are interrupted by a radiofrequency lesion in VA. From these results it is not clear whether the impairment on spatial delayed alternation of the animals with intended VA lesions was due to direct damage to VA or to damage to the efferent fibres from MD. Figure 1 c shows 6 cross-sections through the thalamus for each animal. Lesions were placed in the territory of the thalamus through which the basal ganglia exert this influence. In the present study of the monkeys with the more anterior thalamic lesions, animals 41, 42, and 44 failed to relearn the conditional motor task, and animal 43 only relearned after 1557 trials. Cerebellar territory: VPLo, VLc, X The first question is whether the critical damage is confined to the more anterior basal ganglia territory of the thalamus as established by Ilinsky and Kultas-Ilinsky (1987), or whether it also includes the more posterior cerebellar territory. The mammillothalamic tract (MTT) was cut bilaterally in animals 41, and 43, and as a result there was severe degeneration in the mammillary bodies. Ventralis anterior In the four animals that were impaired on the conditional motor task the lesions were all placed anteriorly in the thalamus, causing very severe damage to the VA nucleus (Fig. This conclusion fits the histological results; but it must be admitted that the evidence can only be suggestive when it is based on placing large lesions in thalamus. Execution This study has shown that an interruption in the basal ganglia territory of the thalamus can cause a severe behavioural impairment. No damage occurred to the globus pallidus in animals 43 and 44; but at the front of the thalamus in animals 41 and 42 the lesions sit just above the globus pallidus and it is possible that they invade its borders. In the present study a lesion in the basal ganglia territory of thalamus either severely disrupted or prevented the relearning of a motor task.

Recently, for the somatosensory fields of the parietal lobe and lateral sulcus of the macaque, there has been an accumulation of new information about architectural characteristics (Jones and Burton, '76; Mesulam and Mufson, '82a), physiological properties (Leinonen et al., '79; Leinonen and Nyman, '79; Robinson and Burton, '80a-c; Hyvarninen, '81, '82; Schneider et al., '841, and cortical connections (Vogt and Pandya, '78; Jones et al., '78; Friedman et al., '80; Pandya and Seltzer, '82; Mesulam and Mufson, '82a; Mufson and Mesulam, '82; Friedman, '83). MATERIALS AND METHODS Seventeen cynomolgus (Mama fascicularis) and 12 rhesus (Macma mulatta) monkeys were used for this study. Data from all but three of the cynomolgus and two of the rhesus monkeys were also analyzed for the companion paper (Friedman et al., '86), which contains the methods used for identifying the somatosensory fields and detailed descriptions of the injections sites and the histological processing methods. Ablations of 52 The brains of seven rhesus monkeys that had previously received ablations of S2 in studies of the role of this cortical area in tactile discrimination learning (Murray and Mishkin, '84; Nakamura, Murray, and Mishkin, unpublished observations) were examined for thalamic cell loss.

Special attention was paid to the second somatosensory area (SZ), the connections of which were also studied by means of thalamic isotope injections and retrograde degeneration.

The location of the thalamic representations of the head, face, and intraoral structures that project to 52 may be in the ventroposterior medial nucleus (VPM). The granular Og) and dysgranular (Id) fields of the insula and the retroinsular field mi) each receive inputs from a variety of nuclei located at the posteroventral border of the thalamus. Area 7b receives its input from Pulm, the oral division of the pulvinar, the lateral posterior n., the medial dorsal n., and the caudal division of the ventrolateral n. These results indicate that the somatic cortical fields, except for those comprising the first somatosensory area, each receive inputs from an array of thalamic nuclei, rather than just one, and that individual thalamic somatosensory relay nuclei each project to more than one cortical field. Key words: thalamocortical relations, somatosensory system, autoradiography, horseradish peroxidase, cortical field, ventral posterior nuclei Accepted May 2, 1986. As yet, however, no studies of the thalamic connectivity of these fields have taken advantage of these findings. The original study correlating thalamic inputs with the cytoarchitecture of the region of the lateral sulcus (Roberts and Akert, '63) reported that some fields receive inputs from individual thalamic nuclei, but it did not convincingly demonstrate that all of the fields receive thalamic inputs. A subsequent study (Burton and Jones, '76) confirmed and refined the cytoarchitectonic description of this cortical region and described thalamic inputs to all of the fields of the insula and the surrounding opercular regions following thalamic injections of tritiated amino acids. According to these investigators (see also Jones and Burton, '761, each cortical field was distinguishable by a characteristic laminar pattern of termination of thalamocortical fibers, and these fibers appeared to arise from a single thalamic nucleus. These findings were consistent with the view (Rose, '49; Rose and Woolsey, '49) that there exists an exclusive, oneto-one relationship between a given thalamic relay nucleus and the cortical field to which it projects (Burton and Jones, '76; Jones and Burton, '76; Jones, '81). There was one exception to this scheme; the caudal division of the ventroposterior lateral thalamic nucleus (VPLc) was reported to project not only to all four of the fields comprising the first somatosensory area (Sl), but also to a fifth field, the second somatosensory area (S2). This was the only thalamic relay nucleus characterized by Burton and Jones ('76) as projecting to more than one cortical field. Studies of the thalamocortical connectivity of the somatosensory and auditory systems in the cat, by contrast, indicate that individual thalamic nuclei may project to several cortical fields, rather than just one (Winer et al., '77; Diamond, '79; Andersen et al., '80; Burton and Kopf, '84). In the rat (Herkenham, '80) most thalamic nuclei have projections that cross cortical architectonic boundaries and thus project to more than one field. These latter studies therefore suggest an alternative view of thalamocortical relations in which a thalamic nucleus projects to several functionally related cortical fields and, conversely, a cortical field receives projections from several thalamic nuclei (Diamond, '79). Our initial findings on the thalamocortical connectivity of the somatosensory areas (Friedman et al., '83) supported the latter viewpoint. We saw retrograde labeling of neurons in several thalamic nuclei after cortical injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) that were clearly restricted to one field. In addition to this general issue concerning thalamocortical connectivity, we saw some instances in which the thalamic nuclei labeled by cortical injections were not those indicated by previous reports. We saw, for example, dense anterograde and retrograde transport to the ventroposterior inferior thalamic nucleus (VPI) after injections of either tritiated amino acids or HRP made into S2. We therefore undertook a reexamination of the thalamocortical relations of the region of the lateral sulcus based primarily on the results obtained following anterograde and retrograde transport of tracers injected into individual cortical fields defined by their physiological properties, architecture, and cortical connections. The fifth monkey received bilateral thalamic injections of isotope. Data from two additional series of monkeys, one series with cortical ablations leading to retrograde degeneration in the thalamus and the other series with isotope injections into the thalamus, were analyzed as described below. Ablations of 52 The brains of seven rhesus monkeys that had previously received ablations of S2 in studies of the role of this cortical area in tactile discrimination learning (Murray and Mishkin, '84; Nakamura, Murray, and Mishkin, unpublished observations) were examined for thalamic cell loss. From each of these brains a series of sections at 1-mm intervals through the extent of the ventroposterior inferior thalamic nucleus (VPn was selected for cell counts within VPI. One additional monkey also received bilateral thalamic isotope injections, and the brain was processed for autoradiography by the methods described in the companion paper (Friedman et al., '86). The cortical sections were examined to see whether thalamwortical terminations were evident in S2 after injections confined to VPLc or VPM, or whether involvement of VPI was required for label to appear in S2. Data analysis Label and cytoarchitectonic boundaries were plotted onto projection drawings of each thalamus. The criteria used to identify thalamic nuclei were mainly those of Olszewski ('52): for the uosteroventral thalamus, however, the descripThe maximal extent of labeling in the HRP experiments was determined from uncounterstained sections, because the thionin itself obscures the chromogen in lightly filled neurons even if no label is lost.

Injections of tritiated amino acids into S2 resulted in dense patches of label, typical of corticothalamic terminal ramifications, within the ventroposterior inferior nucleus (VPI). In order to determine the origin of the thalamic projection to 52, HRP injections were made into retrogradely labeled thalamic neurons were determined. Each of these two smaller in'ections into resulted in only a small number of retrogradely labeled neurons in the thalamus (Fig. The locations of retrogradely labeled thalamocortical relay cells from the largest injection (RM7) are shown in Figure 9 and those from a more restricted injection (RM6) are shown in Figure 11. Further data concerning the relationship of VPI and VPLC to S2 were derived from experiments in which isotope was injected into the ventroposterior thalamus. The locations in the thalamus of the retrogradely labeled cell bodies resulting from these injections are shown on the left. No labeling was found elsewhere in the thalamus.

In this case, heavy thalamic labeling was seen in the lateral posterior n. (LP), Pulo, and the medial pulvinar n. (Pulm). The corticothalamic projections and the thalamocortical projections therefore appear to be reciprocal. A.

The pattern of cortical label resulting from this injection, however, suggests that the injection was confined to Ri (Friedman et al., '85) and that all the thalamic label originated there. Location of retrogradely labeled neurons in the thalamus following an HRP injection in S2 from case RM6 (see Figure 6). The single, small HRP injection that we have performed resulted in retrogradely labeled neurons in all of these nuclei except VPI, thus confirming the reciprocal thalamocortical projections from Po, SG-Li, MGmc, and Pulm.

The distribution of the remaining thalamic label seen involvement of area 7b, this label may have arisen in either in cases CM4 and CM5 was the same as the distribution Pa or Ri. Though it did not cover a large area of rograde label after our Ig injections, our findings suggest cortex, this injection, unlike the others, spread through the that Ig receives its input from other thalamic sources as insula to the underlying claustrum and putamen.

Upper left: Distribution of thalamic label following injection in case RM4. As a result, we may have missed some of the projections of Ia from the thalamus. DISCUSSION The findings lead to three main conclusions: (1) S2 receives its major thalamic input from VPI and only a minor input from VPk, (2) each of the cortical somatosensory fields outside of S1 receives its thalamic inputs from an array of nuclei located in the posteroventral portion of the thalamus; and (3) Pulm has widespread projections to somatosensory fields in addition to its previously reported projections to the frontal, parietal, temporal, and limbic areas. After a discussion of the specific findings, we will address some general issues of thalamocortical relations. Thalamic relations of S2 We have presented four kinds of evidence indicating thet, S2 receives its major thalamic input from VPI, and that this projection is reciprocal: (1) HRP injected into S2 labeled most of the characteristically small neurons within VPI, but few of the large VPLc neurons; (2) tritiated amino acids injected into S2 labeled dense aggregations of terminals within VPI, but no or few terminals in VPLc; (3) small isotope injections in VPh did not label terminations within S2 unless VPI was also involved in the injection site; and (4) ablation of S2 resulted in retrograde cell degeneration in VPI. Herron (83) had previously reported that in the raccoon VPI, but not VPLc, provides thalamic input to S2. If VPI is the major thalamic relay to S2, it should project to S2 in a somatotopically organized manner, like the ventrobasal complex (VB, i.e., VPM and VPLc) does to the fields comprising S1. Moreover, the location in the thalamus of the representations of the head, face, and intraoral structures that project to S2 have yet to be definitively determined. On the basis of the findings obtained from the study of anterograde degeneration following thalamic lesions, Jones and Powell concluded that the thalamic projection to S2 arises in VPLc and VPM. Because thalamocortical aferents leave VPI through VPLc, lesions dorsal and lateral to VPI would, of necessity, interrupt them and therefore lead to the impression that VPLc projects to S2. Thus, a combination of confounding factors may have led them to report that the thalamic projection to S2 arises solely in VB. Distribution of retrogradely labeled neurons in the thalamus resulting from the HRP injection into Ig in case CM4 (see Figures 17 and 20 for injection site). Note wide distribution of labeled cells in the posterior portion of the thalamus with concentrations in SG-Li and Pulm. The data concerning the thalamic relations of S1 and S2 in other species indicate that the projections to these two regions may arise predominantly from different regions of the ventroposterior thalamus. Consistent with this notion, there is electrophysiological evidence for a double representation of the body surface in the thalamus of the rat (Emmers, '65), a finding that also suggests the possibility of separate sources of projections to S1 and some other cortical region, possibly S2. Upper left: Distribution of antervgrade label in thalamus resulting from this injection. These may, in fact, have been in VPI, because Herron and Dykes ('86) have subsequently reported that VPI is the thalamic relay for Pacinian inputs to S2. In the raccoon, as in the macaque, there appears to be a large degree of segregation of thalamic neurons projecting to S1 and S2 (Herron, '83). Dykes and his colleagues ('81) as well as Kaas and his coworkers ('84) have reported that thalamic neuronal responses to vibratory inputs are preferentially located in WI, so a role for the relay of such inputs to S2 seems reasonable. Recent reports have indicated that the dorsal column nuclei @CN) project to VPI (Boivie, '78; Berkley, '80; Kalil, '81), and there is some evidence for inputs from the spinothalamic (DeVito and Simmons, '76; Berkley, '80, '83) and cervicothalamic tracts (Berkley, '80), though the evidence for these inputs is 10969861, 1986, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.902520305 by Rwth Aachen Hochschulbibliothe, Wiley Online Library on [12/09/2023]. Evidence for projections to several cortical fields from individual thalamic nuclei: Projections to Ri, Ig, and Id Burton and Jones ('76) reported that Ri receives its thalamic input only from Pom, Ig only from SG-Li, and Id only from VPI. The present results confirm that a clear difference exists in the sources of inputs to each of these fields, but they demonstrate, in addition, that each field receives inputs from several thalamic nuclei, rather than just one. When the present data, those of Mufson and Mesulam ('PA), and those of Burton and Jones ('76) are considered together, a plan is suggested in which each cortical field receives preferential inputs from one thalamic nucleus (Fig. Because area 2 has recently been shown to receive thalamic inputs from Pulo, as well as from VB (Pons and Kaas, '86), this pattern of multiple thalamic inputs seems to be the rule for all the somatic fields except areas 3a, 3b, and 1, which, in the monkey, appear to receive their thalamic input exclusively from VB (Jones et al., '79; Friedman et al., '80). None of the cortical fields considered here receives its thalamic input from a single thalamic nucleus. One methodological factor that must be considered in our analysis of thalamo-insular relations is the use in the present study of small HRP injections. Summary of thalamic projections to somatosensory cortical fields. Heavy type indicates thalamic nuclei having heaviest projection to each cortical area. Note multiple projections of each nucleus and that all somatosensory cortical fields, except areas 3a, 3b, and 1 receive convergent inputs from several thalamic nuclei. In contrast to the earlier studies of Roberts and Akert ('63) and Burton and Jones ('761, the present study demonstrates that a wide array of thalamic nuclei project to individual cortical fields. This viewpoint suggests that the labeling patterns described here after injections confined to individual cortical fields may reflect the thalamic representation of several specific classes of information being received by that field. Its subcortical inputs appear to arise from only the superior colliculus, claustrum, and thalamic reticular nucleus (Trojanowski and Jacobson, '75), which suggests that Pulm may be different from the relay nuclei discussed above, all of which appear to receive spinal inputs. Because long exposures are needed to fully reveal the terminal pattern of some thalamic projections, and because projections to parietal areas were not seen in either of these studies, they do not rule out 1 ayer I projections from Pulm. Implications for models of thalamic organization The general rules that have been suggested to govern the relationship of a thalamic nucleus to the cortex may be evaluated on the basis of the present findings. 17; Jones and Burton, '76; Jones, '81; see also Frost and Caviness, '80), suggests that a oneto-one relationship exists between a given thalamic nucleus and a given cortical field. In this model, the other thalamic nuclei, which are also modality specific, project to a constellation of cortical fields. Herkenham ('80, '86) has suggested an alternative though not necessarily contradictory plan, in which thalamic nuclei are classified by the cortical laminae to which they 10969861, 1986, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.902520305 by Rwth Aachen Hochschulbibliothe, Wiley Online Library on [12/09/2023]. The present data on thalamocortical and corticothalamic connectivity of the somatosensory system suggest a system of multiple projections from each of the thalamic relay nuclei of the somatosensory system to several of the cortical fields of that system. There is not now any readily apparent, simple rule that describes the relations between the thalamic nuclei and cortical fields described in this report. Each nucleus appears to project to a specific group of fields, and each field may be defined by the specific constellation of thalamic nuclei that project to it. This conclusion is in agreement with previous definitions of a cortical field (Rose, '49; Rose and Woolsey, '49) in that it includes thalamic connectivity as part of that definition; it differs in suggesting that the projections of an array of nuclei, rather than of a single nucleus, describe the field. The issue here is not whether some nuclei, such as those of the intralaminar group, have widespread projections, but whether thalamic relay nuclei, defined as those that transfer specific sensory information, have projections to several cortical fields rather than just one. So there may be no class of thalamic nuclei that projects to only one cortical field. Diamond ('79) has also proposed that for each sensory system there is one thalamic nucleus that projects to all of the fields of the system. Implications for thalamic micro-organization The arrangements of the afferent and efferent projections of VB and its surrounding nuclei, including VPI, in various species have suggested to many investigators (Whitsel, '78; Berkley, '80; Friedman and Jones, '81; Spreafico et al., '81; Jones and Friedman, '82; Burton and Kopf, '84) a core-shell form of organization for this thalamic complex. Although such an arrangement may describe, to a large extent, the distribution of thalamic projections to S1 and its surrounding fields, other observations suggest a need for refinement of this organizational plan. Functional groupings analogous to the striatal patches and matrix may be represented by rods of thalamic neurons, which receive specific DCN inputs and project to S1, and neurons interspersed between the rods, which receive another source of input and project to S2.

Special attention was paid to the second somatosensory area (SZ), the connections of which were also studied by means of thalamic isotope injections and retrograde degeneration. Following small injections of isotope or HRP into the hand representation of S2, only VPL was labeled. Larger injections, which included the representations of more body parts, led to heavy label in VPI, with scattered label in VPLc, the central lateral nucleus (CL), and the posterior nucleus (Po). In addition, small isotope injections into VPLc did not result in label in S2 unless VPI was also involved in the injection site, and ablations of S2 led to cell loss in VPI. Comparison of injections involving different body parts in S2 suggested a somatotopic arrangement within VPE such that the trunk and lower limb representations are located posterolaterally and the hand and arm representations anteromedially. A subsequent study (Burton and Jones, '76) confirmed and refined the cytoarchitectonic description of this cortical region and described thalamic inputs to all of the fields of the insula and the surrounding opercular regions following thalamic injections of tritiated amino acids. We saw retrograde labeling of neurons in several thalamic nuclei after cortical injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) that were clearly restricted to one field. In addition to this general issue concerning thalamocortical connectivity, we saw some instances in which the thalamic nuclei labeled by cortical injections were not those indicated by previous reports. We saw, for example, dense anterograde and retrograde transport to the ventroposterior inferior thalamic nucleus (VPI) after injections of either tritiated amino acids or HRP made into S2. We therefore undertook a reexamination of the thalamocortical relations of the region of the lateral sulcus based primarily on the results obtained following anterograde and retrograde transport of tracers injected into individual cortical fields defined by their physiological properties, architecture, and cortical connections. Data from all but three of the cynomolgus and two of the rhesus monkeys were also analyzed for the companion paper (Friedman et al., '86), which contains the methods used for identifying the somatosensory fields and detailed descriptions of the injections sites and the histological processing methods. Four of the additional animals received injections of HRP conjugated to wheat germ agglutinin (HRP-WGA) into different parts of S2 or of the insular cortex following aspiration of the frontoparietal operculum to reveal the dorsal aspect of the insula. The fifth monkey received bilateral thalamic injections of isotope. Data from two additional series of monkeys, one series with cortical ablations leading to retrograde degeneration in the thalamus and the other series with isotope injections into the thalamus, were analyzed as described below. Histological procedures The brains with injections of HRP-WGA were processed by modified versions of the protocols described previously (Mesulam, '78). Thalamic injections Brains from seven cynomolgus monkeys that had earlier received injections of isotope into either VPLc or VPM were also available. These animals were from previous studies in which the injection sites have been described in detail (Friedman and Jones, '81; Jones and Friedman, '82; Jones et al., '82). One additional monkey also received bilateral thalamic isotope injections, and the brain was processed for autoradiography by the methods described in the companion paper (Friedman et al., '86). As a group, the eight injections covered much of the ventral territory of VPLc and only a small part of VPM, and two of the injections involved VPI as well. The cortical sections were examined to see whether thalamwortical terminations were evident in S2 after injections confined to VPLc or VPM, or whether involvement of VPI was required for label to appear in S2. Small WI neurons in A are IabeIed with TMB and counterstained with thionin after an injection of HRP into S2. Lower right: Composite map of the lateral sulcus showing the location of the isotope injections in three cases for which the transported label is illustrated in Figures 2-4. The injections in cases RM1 and RM2 were confined to S2 on the parietal operculum of the lateral sulcus. Upper left Coronal sections through the portion of the thalamus containing labeled terminal fields following an injection of isotope into the physiologically identified hand representation of S2 in case RMI.

See Figure 1A in Friedman (83) for photomicrograph of injection site. Label was noted within this lamina in several animals with injections in the dysgranular insular field (Id). Connections of S2 Isotope injections. This was true in each of four monkeys that received isotope injections; with 16-30-week exposure times, all had dense label in VPI, but no more than sparse label in other nuclei of the ventral group. The injections in cases RM1 and CM3 were made through a syringe that had a microelectrode attached to its barrel, and the injection in RM2 was made iontophoretically through a glass pipette. 2B in the accompanying paper for injection site) additional terminal labeling was seen within VPLc, immediately adjacent to VPI. There was also label in the ventral part of CL in all cases, and in cases RM1 and CM3 there was additional label in Pub, presumably as a result of leakage of the isotope into the portion of area 7b overlying S2 (see below for analysis of injections into area 7b). HRP injections. In order to determine the origin of the thalamic projection to 52, HRP injections were made into retrogradely labeled thalamic neurons were determined. The extents of four of these injections are shown in Figure 6. Sections from the two smallest injections (CM2, CM15), made iontophoretically and clearly confined to S2 on the parietal operculum of the lateral sulcus, are shown in more detail in Figure 7. To examine the possibility raised by the results of the small HRP and isotope injections that only certain portions of S2 receive an input exclusively from VPI, the others receiving an input from VPI and VPLc, we subsequently made three larger injections of HRP-WGA. The locations of retrogradely labeled thalamocortical relay cells from the largest injection (RM7) are shown in Figure 9 and those from a more restricted injection (RM6) are shown in Figure 11. Because we did not record in the anterior portion of S2 before making this injection, it is not clear if the injection site in RM7 involved the portion of S1 on the inner face of the frontoparietal operculum that is known to contain the representation of intraoral structures (Robinson and Burton, 'SOa). The label in VPM in this case, then, may be due to the inclusion of S1 in the injection site. A second, smaller injection of HRP-WGA (Fig. In summary, the smaller HRP injections failed to label neurons in VPLc, whereas the larger ones resulted in scattered retrograde labeling of neurons there. The label in Pulo, LP, and MDpc is interpreted as being the result of leakage of HRP into the overlying area 7b because neither the HRP nor the isotope injections into S2 that did not involve area 7b resulted in label in these nuclei, whereas the injections confined to area 7b inevitably labeled them (see below for details).

Further data concerning the relationship of VPI and VPLC to S2 were derived from experiments in which isotope was injected into the ventroposterior thalamus. Some injections were restricted entirely to VPLc, whereas others spread into VPI; none were limited to VPI. The injection sites illustrated by the open profiles in Figure 12 are those that labeled S1 but not S2, and the sites with filled profiles are those that labeled both S1 and S2. ""here were five injections that failed to label S2; they were confined to VPLC, except for one that also involved VPM. By contrast, two of the three injections that resulted in label in S2 were the ones that involved VPI as well as VPLc. The third injection that labeled S2 was located in VPM (CM59). This injection labeled a portion of the superior limiting sulcus that appeared, on topographic grounds, to be in S2. Neither the two cases with isotope injections involving VPM nor others with cortical injections of HRP allowed us to reach a firm conclusion as to whether 52 received projections from VPM.

Figure 13 shows the label resulting from one of the isotope injections that is representative of the group. Retrograde label was seen in these same nuclei after similarly placed HRP injections (Kasdon and Jacobson, '78). The HRP injection resulted in retrogradely labeled neurons in the same nuclei, but presumably because it was a small injection, there were only a few labeled neurons in each nucleus.

Details concerning the receptive field properties of the neurons near the injection sites are given in the companion paper. 151, the anterior portion of the injection site was located at the posterior pole of the insula and probably spread to parts of S2 that contain the trunk and lower body representations, and may have involved the granular insula (Ig) as well. The injection site in case RM3 (Figs. The label in the pulvinar may have resulted from the leakage of isotope into the portion of area 7b that is in the upper bank of the lateral sulcus, and through which the injection needle passed to reach Ri in the lower bank of the sulcus. The pattern of cortical label resulting from this injection, however, suggests that the injection was confined to Ri (Friedman et al., '85) and that all the thalamic label originated there. Location of retrogradely labeled neurons in the thalamus following an HRP injection in S2 from case RM6 (see Figure 6). Note lack of label in VPLc and VPM from this relatively small injection. In case RM3, however, we could find no label in S1 and therefore cannot explain the label in VPI on the basis of the involvement of S2 in the injection. On the basis of the findings of Burton and Jones, one might expect that the label in SG-Li resulted from the inclusion of Ig in the injection site. While this may be plausible for the anterior injection (RM4), the same explanation is not tenable in case RM3, in which the injection was located several millimeters behind the posterior pole of the insula. The single, small HRP injection that we have performed resulted in retrogradely labeled neurons in all of these nuclei except VPI, thus confirming the reciprocal thalamocortical projections from Po, SG-Li, MGmc, and Pulm. A projection from Ri to the deep layers of the superior colliculus was also noted after isotope injections.

Conventions as in Figure 2. injections. The largest injection (case CM7) also resulted in label in Pulm, though it is not clear whether this was caused by involvement of Ia or Id in the injection site. The lack of label in Pulm after the smaller injections suggests that Pulm does not project to Ia. On the other hand, our injections were quite small and did not cover the whole of Ia. Thalamic relations of S2 We have presented four kinds of evidence indicating thet, S2 receives its major thalamic input from VPI, and that this projection is reciprocal: (1) HRP injected into S2 labeled most of the characteristically small neurons within VPI, but few of the large VPLc neurons; (2) tritiated amino acids injected into S2 labeled dense aggregations of terminals within VPI, but no or few terminals in VPLc; (3) small isotope injections in VPh did not label terminations within S2 unless VPI was also involved in the injection site; and (4) ablation of S2 resulted in retrograde cell degeneration in VPI. These findings are supported by those of Manzoni and his colleagues (84), who have recently reported that following HRP injections into S2, VPI contained large numbers of labeled neurons, but label in VPh, if present, was sparse (6. Distribution of label following injection in case RM3 (see Figure 15). A photomicrograph of the injection site has been published (see Figure 1B in Friedman, '83). The label from the injections in the hand-digit representation (RM1, RM2, CM6, CM15) was concentrated anteriorly in the midmediolateral portion of VPI, whereas label from injections that involved the representation of the proximal body in addition to the hand (CM1, CM3), or the hindlimb representation in addition to Ri (RM4), occupied the more posterolateral aspects of VPI. None of our S2 injections labeled projections to the most medial parts of VPI, though this area was labeled after Id injections. Because we do not have injections in all parts of the S2 body representation, however, we cannot describe this apparent somatotopy in greater detail.

""he coronal sections illustrate the maximal spread of each injection when incubated with ""MB and not counterstained. Hatched area shown in some sections represents region of opercular cortex removed to expose the injection site. These problems were avoided in the study of Burton and Jones ('76), who used the autoradiographic technique for tracing pathways after rather large isotope injections into VB. Unless these injections also included VPI, and from their figures it seems that some did not, these data indicate that VPLc also projects to 52. ""his conclusion is strengthened by the apparent topographic order of transported label in S2 resulting from their VPLc injections, by the results of HRP injections in 52 that also led to label in VPLc (Burton and Robinson, '81; present results), and by the recent report of Burton ('84), which illustrated anterograde label in VPI and the surrounding parts of VPLc after injections of isotope into S2. Nevertheless, of the seven small isotope injections in VPLc described in the present study, only two, both of which involved VPI, led to label in S2. Only the largest injections led to retrogradely labeled neurons in VPLc, and these were 10969861, 1986, 3, Downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cne.902520305 by Rwth Aachen Hochschulbibliothe, Wiley Online Library on [12/09/2023]. Distribution of retrogradely labeled neurons in the thalamus resulting from the HRP injection into Ig in case CM4 (see Figures 17 and 20 for injection site). Labeling nn CM is the result of the injection spreading to the putamen. These observations suggest, first, that VPLc may project to only certain regions within 52 and, second, that the projection to S2 may arise from only restricted zones (or neurons) that may be widely spaced in VPLc and could easily be missed by small isotope injections made into VPLc. Support for these ideas comes from one of the most compelling findings of the present study, that is, the total lack of label in VPLc after small isotope or HRP injections into the S2 hand-digit representation. Following larger injections, however, label was seen in both VPI and VPLc. Examination of the locations in both the rat and opossum of the injection sites in VB that best labeled S2 shows that they are located in the posteroventral part of VB. Lower right Location of an injection of isotope made into Id. The edge of the injection reached the lateral border of the claustrum. Upper left: Distribution of antervgrade label in thalamus resulting from this injection. Conventions as in Figure 2. particularly responsive to vibratory inputs are reported to label adjacent, but largely segregated, populations of neurons in VPL (Fisher et al., '83), with the neurons labeled after S2 injections being found posterolateral to those labeled after the S1 injections. Upper right: Locations of two HRP injections confined to Ig (CiVI4) and Id (CM6) in the cortex are shown in upper right. In CM4 there was spread to the underlying claustrum and putamen, and in CM6 the injection spread through the extreme capsule to the superficial border of the claustrum. Upper left: Distribution of labeled cells resulting from the injection of HRP in case CM6. Thus, after an injection of HRP or isotope into Ri, the most densely labeled nucleus is Po; less dense label is found in MGmc, SG-Li, Pulm, and the intralaminar nuclei. In two of the cases with isotope injections, VPI was labeled as well. After HRP injections into Ig, SG-Li consistently contained the largest number of labeled neurons, with MGmc, Po, and VPI containing fewer labeled cells. After HRP injections into Id, there is a band of label that begins in ventromedial VMb. The injections into Ia result in label mainly in the dorsomedial aspects of VMb and the ventral portions of MD. One methodological factor that must be considered in our analysis of thalamo-insular relations is the use in the present study of small HRP injections. Because a primary concern was to avoid involvement of the claustrum in the injection sites, most of the injections were made iontophorPulo Pulm LP M Dpc VLCY Fig. Not only was their cortical spread restricted, but the injection sites were not dense. Even when taken as groups, the five injections into Ig (Fig. Because of this, the injections may not have resulted in significant retrograde transport to regions which, in fact, project to those fields. This most likely limited their ability to see transported label to only those areas of cortex receiving the heaviest input from each injection site. This viewpoint suggests that the labeling patterns described here after injections confined to individual cortical fields may reflect the thalamic representation of several specific classes of information being received by that field. Projections of the medial pulvinar Among the nuclei labeled after injections into somatosensory cortical fields, Pulm has the most widespread projections. A reexamination of the efferents of Pulm and Pulo that utilizes the autoradiographic technique with long exposure times and injection sites selected by recording single-unit response properties in this region would be of help in revealing the organization of these two nuclei. In the present study, two injections into ventral Ig, which probably also involved the para-insular field, resulted in retrogradely labeled neurons in MGv, which supplies the major input to Al. In the present study, the small population of VPLc neurons labeled after S2 injections was found to be widely scattered, in distinct contrast to the clustered arrangement of VPLc neurons labeled after S1 injections (Jones et al., '79).

A major difficulty in attempting to define motor regions of the ventral thalamus based on afferent connections from the cerebellum and efferent connections with the motor cortex is that no comprehensive study of all the cerebellothalamic connections exists for the rhesus monkey. While projections of individual nuclei have been described for the dentate (Chan-Palay, '77; Thach and Jones, '79) and fastigial nuclei (Batton et al., '77) with autoradiographic methods, no detailed studies of the interpositus connections with the thalamus exist for the rhesus monkey. MATERIALS AND METHODS Nineteen adolescent or adult rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) weighing 2.5-6.5 kg were used. As in these studies it was possible to distinguish a pars rotunda and a pars triangularis in the cuneate nucleus, although the injection sites and lesions were rarely confined to a single region of the nucleWhen the macaque brains in the present study were cut in the stereotaxic frontal plane, the thalamic nuclei as revealed by the Nissl stain corresponded closely to the cell groups delineated by Olszewski ('52). In another study employing silver degeneration methods after lesions of the SCP in rhesus monkeys (Miller and Strominger, '77), degeneration was noted in the parvocellular division of VA. By contrast, and in agreement with the present experiments, the silver degeneration results of Stanton ('79) and autoradiographic results of Chan-Palay ('77) showed relatively few dentato-thalamic axons extending into VA in comparison with those to regions of VL caudal to it. In contrast to these studies, a recent physiological investigation of the afferent input to the VPL of macaca fascicularis (Horne and Tracey, '79) concluded that the latencies of activation of units in VPLo were short following peripheral stimulation and were thus consistent with a lemniscal pathway via the dorsal column nuclei. The present experiments demonstrate that the ventral thalamic complex of the rhesus monkey may be subdivided into motor and sensory regions corresponding on the one hand to areas relaying cerebellar information to motor cortex and on the other hand relaying lemniscal input to sensory cortex.

The cerebellar nuclei give rise to a massive projection to the contralateral midbrain and thalamus via the ascending limb of the superior cerebellar peduncle. All the deep cerebellar nuclei project upon a broad area of the contralateral ventral thalamus as well as certain intralaminar nuclei. Corresponding ipsilatera1 thalamic terminations are sparse. The topographic organization of cerebellothalamic fibers does not correspond to individual cerebellar nuclei or to cytoarchitectonic divisions of the ventral thalamic nuclei. The topography of the cerebellothalamic fibers is arranged in a mediolateral pattern with fibers originating from anterior zones of the dentate and interpositus ending most laterally and those from posterior dentate and interpositus terminating most medially. The longitudinal strips of terminal labeling in the ventral thalamic nuclei are made up of still smaller terminal units consisting of disk-like aggregates of silver grains separated from one another by grain-free spaces. These results demonstrate a segregation of cerebellar and dorsal columnar inputs to motor and sensory regions of the thalamus, respectively. INTRODUCTION The ventral nuclear complex of the primate thalamus has long been recognized as a major recipient zone for ascending fiber systems. Recent studies with modern anatomical techniques have delineated some of the terminal regions for fibers arising from the cerebellar nuclei (Mehler, '71; Szabo, '75; Kievet and Kuypers, '72; Chan-Palay, '77; Batton et al., '77; Miller and Strominger, '77; Thach and Jones, '79), the dorsal column nuclei (Bowsher, '58, '61; Boivie, '781, and the spinothalamic tract (Mehler et al., '60; Bowsher, '61; Kerr and Lippman, '74; Kerr, '75; Boivie, '79). Despite these investigations there remain a number of controversies regarding the parcellation of the ventral thalamus into individual 0021-9967/81/1951-0025$04.40 0 1981 ALAN R. LISS. The present study comprises the first of two reports which describes some afferents to the ventral nuclei in an attempt to define certain areas of the monkey's thalamus as anatomically related either to motor or sensory systems. A major difficulty in attempting to define motor regions of the ventral thalamus based on afferent connections from the cerebellum and efferent connections with the motor cortex is that no comprehensive study of all the cerebellothalamic connections exists for the rhesus monkey. While projections of individual nuclei have been described for the dentate (Chan-Palay, '77; Thach and Jones, '79) and fastigial nuclei (Batton et al., '77) with autoradiographic methods, no detailed studies of the interpositus connections with the thalamus exist for the rhesus monkey. Further, since different investigators employ different planes of section and varying terminologies for the monkey's thalamus, it is often difficult to compare results from one study to another. More is known about the ascending connections to the thalamus from the dorsal column nuclei (DCN) (Boivie, '78). First, by investigating both cerebellar and lemniscal afferent systems on the opposite sides of the same brain it was possible to compare their thalamic terminations and to find any possible areas of overlap. Second, by combining these investigations with anterograde studies of thalamo-cortical connections on the contralatera1 side of the same animal, an attempt was made to define anatomically what ascending fibers were related to the thalamic nuclei relaying to motor vs. sensory cortex (Kalil, '76). A further controversy exists concerning the source of input to the transitional region of the thalamus which lies between the lemniscal and cerebellar recipient zones and which relays to area 3a in the depths of the central sulcus lying between motor and primary sensory cortex. Physiologically this cortical region has been described as a recipient of Group I muscle afferents (Phillips et al., '71; Wiesendanger, '73; Lucier et al., '75; Heath et al., '76), but the peripheral source of inputs to 3a relayed through the thalamus remains anatomically unclear (see Jones et al., '79).

Frozen sections of 30p were cut through the entire brainstem and thalamus, individually mounted on gelatinized slides, defatted in xylene, and coated with NTB-2 (Kodak) emulsion. Additional sections through the thalamus were silver stained, and various suppression times used to obtain the maximum extent of fiber degeneration in the thalamus. Borders of thalamic and dorsal column nuclei were then carefully drawn by projecting adjacent Nissl stained sections onto the outline drawings of the silver sections. RESULTS Nomenclature of the cerebellar, dorsal column, and ventral thalamic nuclei The present study has adopted the criteria of Courville and Cooper ('70) for subdividing the cerebellar nuclei. As in these studies it was possible to distinguish a pars rotunda and a pars triangularis in the cuneate nucleus, although the injection sites and lesions were rarely confined to a single region of the nucleWhen the macaque brains in the present study were cut in the stereotaxic frontal plane, the thalamic nuclei as revealed by the Nissl stain corresponded closely to the cell groups delineated by Olszewski ('52). Therefore, despite the fact that different regions of the ventral posterolateral nucleus clearly have different anatomical connections (see below), the nomenclature employed by Olszewski based on cytoarchitectonic criteria has been kept to facilitate comparisons with other studies on the ventral thalamus. A recent study (Jones et al., '79) included illustrations of frontal sections through and descriptions of some of the ventral thalamic nuclei. At levels rostral to Figure lA, the cell clusters of the VLo begin to be displaced by the divisions of the ventral anterior (VA) nucleus, which appear medial to VLo to occupy the rostral pole of the thalamus. Cerebellothalamic projections from dentate and interpositus nuclei In three animals large injections of isotope heavily labeled extensive regions of both dentate and interpositus nuclei. At the level of the decussation the labeled fibers cross the midline and ascend rostrally towards the thalamus as the ascending limb of the SCP. As fibers ascend toward the thalamus in the SCP they contribute a small projection bilaterally to the ventrolateral zone of the central gray, and massive terminations to magnocellular and parvocellular divisions of the contralateral red nucleus. Nissl-stained frozen sections of a normal monkey brain cut in the frontal plane illustrating some representative anteroposterior levels through the thalamus. Anterograde labeling of the contralateral midbrain and thalamus following cerebellar nuclear injection shown at top and in Fig. As fibers complete their crossing in the decussation of the SCP, they enter the thalamus in several thin fascicles. Other loosely organized sprays of fibers enter the thalamus in a bundle running in the middle and one encircling the lateral edge of the thalamus, At A5.1 (Fig. At level A8.1 massive numbers of fibers enter the thalamus and appear to merge together in a continuous sheet. Other scattered fibers recross the midline in the thalamic commissure just dorsal to the Fig. Dark-field photomicrographs of coronal sections through regions of terminal labeling in the contralateral thalamus of 4 monkeys with injections of the cerebellar nuclei. For approximately matching bright-field illustrations of similar levels through the thalamic nuclei, see Fig. 1. x 10. cerebral aqueduct, and in the ipsilateral thalamus these fibers give rise to a few very widely scattered small clumps of silver grains in the CL, VLc, and VPLo.

Black and white arrows indicate approximately matching thalamic regions. As VPLo expands across the thalamus, fibers which were passing through VLc now terminate massively in VPLo. Labeling of the contralateral thalamus is limited to a few scattered small grain clusters corresponding to the intensely labeled patches in nucleus X on the opposite side. The terminals begin to dwindle in intensity toward the rostral half of VLo and do not extend forward to any part of VA. Dentato-thalamic connections In five animals it was possible to limit the injection sites to small regions of the dentate nucleus with minimal involvement of other cerebellar nuclei. As shown in Figure 9, crossed fibers of the ascending limb enter the thalamus, and those encircling its lateral rim begin to collect in the VLps. Only a few scattered fibers penetrate into the VA, and the contralateral thalamus contains a few terminal bursts in the dorsal region of nucleus X. In the thalamus labeling is concentrated in CL and in several horizontal disks in the lateral half of VPLo and VLo. pain and thalamus after injection shown at top and in Cerebellothalarnic projections from the interpositus nuclei Selective injections were made in the anterior or posterior interpositus nuclei in several animals without involvement of the dentate. Anterograde labeling of the contralateral midbrain and thalamus after cerebellar nuclear injection shown in Fig. In the thalamus, clumps of silver grains begin to accumulate in several strips across the extreme caudal pole of VLps. Ipsilateral to the injection site, the thalamic projections are represented only by a few widely dispersed terminal zones. In this case thalamic labeling is found in the contralateral VLc but only in its most medial third. In contrast to the previous case, there are no lateral fibers extending around the lateral rim of the thalamus and no contribution to the VLps. In more rostra1 zones of the thalamus, label is confined to the medial half of VPLo and could not be followed into VLo or nucleus X. Fastigiothalamic projections In a single animal, MVL 24, the fastigial nucleus was labeled throughout its extent by a vertical approach (Fig. Efferent fastigial fibers bound for the thalamus cross to the contralateral side of the brain within the cerebellum by way of the uncinate fasciculus (UF). As fibers in the UF approach the posterior thalamus, a lateral bundle ascends rostrally in the lateral thalamic margin, and small scattered clusters of silver grains accumulate in VLc and VPLo. Since a substantial part of the contributions to the ventral nuclei of the thalamus also arise from the SCP, it is likely that the contribution to the thalamus from the fastigial nucleus is sparse in this case. At the caudal pole of the contralateral thalamus massive numbers of degenerating fibers lie medial to the medial geniculate body. With regard to terminals in the medial border of the medial geniculate nucleus, the pulvinar, or the suprageniculate nucleus, collectively included in the PO as described by Boivie ('781, preterminal degenpography of dentato-thalamic connections the fibers of passage. Anterograde labeling of the contralateral thalamus of MVL24 following cerebellar nuclear injection shown in Fig. In contrast to the cerebellothalamic projections, the fibers from the DCN terminate fairly uniformly in the lateral VPLc except where they are separated by longitudinal fiber bundles running through the nucleus. Terminations in the thalamus The present results demonstrate that all the deep cerebellar nuclei project upon a broad area of the contralateral ventral thalamus as well as certain intralaminar nuclei. Evidence of a topographic organization in the cerebeilothalamic system is first seen in the SCP. In general, the topographic organization of cerebellothalamic fibers does not appear to correspond to individual cerebellar nuclei or cytoarchitectonic boundaries of the thalamus, a finding recently described in the cerebellothalamic system of the cat (Hendry et al., '79). Concerning the total distribution of cerebellar efferents within the thalamus in the monkey, previous reports suggest some differences of opinion. In another study employing silver degeneration methods after lesions of the SCP in rhesus monkeys (Miller and Strominger, '77), degeneration was noted in the parvocellular division of VA. By contrast, and in agreement with the present experiments, the silver degeneration results of Stanton ('79) and autoradiographic results of Chan-Palay ('77) showed relatively few dentato-thalamic axons extending into VA in comparison with those to regions of VL caudal to it. Topography The topographic organization of the cerebellar fibers is arranged in a mediolateral pattern, with fibers originating from anterior zones of the dentate and interpositus ending most laterally and fibers arising from posterior dentate and interpositus terminating in the medial zones of the thalamus. The anterior posterior topography of dentato-thalamic connections demonstrated in the present study is similar to that described by Stanton, '79; Thach and Jones, '79; and Chan-Palay, '77. Although the evidence regarding the fastigio-thalamic projection is limited in the present study to a single case, it seems likely that the fastigial contribution to the thalamus is sparse in comparison to the dentate and interpositus, since only a small number of scattered grain clusters were found in VLc and VPLo after a large injection of the fastigial nucleus. The mediolateral topography of the projection of the SCP upon the ventral thalamus is clear cut and nonoverlapping. However, the dentate and interpositus do not appear to project to discrete mutually exclusive thalamic regions. Mode of termination The longitudinal strips of terminal labeling running in continuity from posterior to anterior regions of the ventral thalamus are made up of still smaller terminal units. Thus the terminations of cerebellar efferents in the thalamus may be envisaged as a series of hollow rods which, when juxtaposed, form longitudinally oriented slabs separated in the mediolateral axis by unlabeled spaces. Harding ('73) also commented on the patchy distribution of degenerating cerebellothalamic endings of the monkey's VL, observing with the electron microscope many normal boutons between the degenerating ones. Thalatriic distribution of efferents from the DCN The degeneration and autoradiographic results demonstrate a mediolateral topography in the contralateral VPLc, which is reversed in the thalamus so that fibers originating from the cuneate nucleus terminate medially, while those arising from the gracile nucleus end in the lateral zone of VPLc. Both methods also demonstrate, that, in striking contrast to the patchy aggregates of silver grains observed in the thalamus after cerebellar injections, degenerating axon terminals or silver grains are spread fairly uniformly over the medial or lateral VPLc following lesions or injections of the DCN. He also noted a mediolateral topography in the thalamus similar to that of the present study. In an earlier study with the Nauta method, Bowsher ('61) concluded that VPL is the primary zone of termination in the monkey's thalamus for the medial lemniscus. Segregation of cerebellar and dorsal columnar inputs The results reported in these experiments reveal that with regard to their afferent input, the motor and sensory regions of the monkey's ventral thalamus are separate and discrete. Thus the terminal field of the DCN corresponds precisely to the thalamic areas of the VPL in which Poggio and Mountcastle ('63) recorded classical lemniscal responses following stimulation of the periphery. The present results show a dense topographic termination of efferent fibers from the deep cerebellar nuclei to the VPLo, VLc, VLo, nucleus X, and CL, suggesting that these regions represent motor areas of the ventral thalamus. Therefore, the fact that cells in VPLo were labeled after injections of HRP into the motor cortex would suggest that VPLo is a thalamic relay for sensory input from peripheral receptors to motor cortex. Area 3a in its reciprocal corticothalamic relationships appears to resemble the motor rather than the somatosensory cortex (Jones, '79). Since, in the present experiments dorsal column nuclear projections do not extend beyond the limits of VPLc, the region known as area 3a also resembles the motor cortex in receiving its thalamic input from VPLo (Kalil, '76; Strick, '76a; Kievit and Kuypers, '77), which in turn derives its peripheral input from the cerebellum and not the dorsal column nuclei. The present experiments demonstrate that the ventral thalamic complex of the rhesus monkey may be subdivided into motor and sensory regions corresponding on the one hand to areas relaying cerebellar information to motor cortex and on the other hand relaying lemniscal input to sensory cortex.

After completion of the injection the needle was left in place for 20 minutes. The dorsal column nuclei (DCN) were injected in six animals under direct vision by flexing the monkey's head forward, cutting the atlanto-occipital membrane, and then making several penetrations with the needle. In a number of cases an injection of the DCN was made in the same animal on the side contralateral to a cerebellar injection. As in these studies it was possible to distinguish a pars rotunda and a pars triangularis in the cuneate nucleus, although the injection sites and lesions were rarely confined to a single region of the nucleWhen the macaque brains in the present study were cut in the stereotaxic frontal plane, the thalamic nuclei as revealed by the Nissl stain corresponded closely to the cell groups delineated by Olszewski ('52). In other animals it was possible to inject very small amounts of label into small regions of a single cerebellar nucleus. The injection sites were considered to include an intensely labeled center in which silver grains lay densely over cell bodies and their proximal dendrites as well as a less intensely labeled surround in which the distribution of silver grains was sparser and more evenly distributed over cell bodies and neuropil. In the dorsal column nuclei, injections were centered in either the gracile or cuneate nucleus, but some spread of label into the adjacent dorsal column nucleus was unavoidable. Lesions of the DCN were far more effective than injections in reaching over the entire extent of a single nucleus or including the major portion of both nuclei. Cerebellothalamic projections from dentate and interpositus nuclei In three animals large injections of isotope heavily labeled extensive regions of both dentate and interpositus nuclei. In one animal (MCB 6) two penetrations from a posterior approach were made, and labeled precursor was injected at several points along the horizontal axis to maximize the uptake of label by all regions of the nuclei.

Although the evidence regarding the fastigio-thalamic projection is limited in the present study to a single case, it seems likely that the fastigial contribution to the thalamus is sparse in comparison to the dentate and interpositus, since only a small number of scattered grain clusters were found in VLc and VPLo after a large injection of the fastigial nucleus. In the present study, a comparison of results obtained from injections of both dentate and interpositus with those in which a single nucleus was injected reveals that when the interpositus nuclei are injected, there is consistent labeling of VLps, VLc, and VPLo. Further, injections of the interpositus alone failed to elicit labeling of the CL, whereas injections including the dentate showed a heavy projection to CL. Both methods also demonstrate, that, in striking contrast to the patchy aggregates of silver grains observed in the thalamus after cerebellar injections, degenerating axon terminals or silver grains are spread fairly uniformly over the medial or lateral VPLc following lesions or injections of the DCN.

Field potentials of somewhat longer latency (4-5 msec) were recorded in VPL and in other thalamic nuclei, including the posterior nuclear group. Neuronal responses were recorded in thalamic nuclei of awake flaxedilized Rhesus monkeys. Key words: Vestibular thalamic relay - Vestibulo-proprioceptive convergence - Ventrobasal complex - Rhesus monkey Introduction In an earlier communication (part I, Deecke et al., 1974), it was demonstrated that in response to vestibular nerve stimulation thalamic field potentials of 1 Abteilung Neurologie, Sektion Neurophysiologie, University of UIm, SteinhSvetstr. In addition to the literature review given in part I, further studies on vestibular thalamic input have appeared. In the cat, a projection system has been reported to the ventrobasal complex (Day et al., 1976) as well as ""in the ventrocaudal part of the thalamus between the centre m6dian, the ventrobasal group and the caudal segment of the ventrolateral nucleus"" (Sans et al., 1976); Raymond et al., 1976). These authors also confirmed our suggestion in Figure 8 of part I that the vestibulo-thalamic fibers travel between the medial lemniscus and the brachium colliculi superioris. In the squirrel monkey the most prominent vestibulo-thalamic projection is directed to the ventrobasal complex, other regions receiving labyrinthine input including the posterior nuclei, pulvinar and centre m6dian (Liedgren et al., 1976). Coronal 50 Ix sections of the thalamus stained with cresyl violet and luxol fast blue were used for histological reconstruction of recording sites, which were determined with reference to electrolytic lesions. Results Only thalamic neurons which responded to labyrinth polarisation were considered in the present experiments. In this thalamic zone which Olszewski (1959) includes within the nucleus ventroposterior inferior (VPI), both vestibular and deep somatic recptive fields are found, the latter stemming from joint and muscle tissues over large and sometimes bilateral areas. Characteristics of the Vestibular Responses Vestibular connections to the ventrobasal thalamus originate in both labyrinths: 95% of the cells responded to contralateral and 83 % to ipsilateral labyrinth polarisation with 78 % receiving converging input from both labyrinths (Table 1, Fig. The use of this stimulus permits unequivocal conclusions about the side of origin of a vestibular response, but is difficult to interpret with regard to the nature of vestibular information carried to thalamic cells. Localisation of vestibularly responsive cells in the rhesus monkey thalamus, as reconstructed from electrode tracks marked by electrolytic lesions. (1965), since a crossing of the vestibulo-thalamic fibers was assumed. Since a similar pattern was found in the vestibular nuclei, this observation suggests a stronger bilateral vestibulo-thalamic projection than was evident from evoked Vestibulo-Proprioceptive Convergence in Thalamus Table 1. Labyrinth polarisation (constant current source) could result in tonic and in phasic thalamic responses. Neck (vertebral column) proprioceptors were influencing more vestibular thalamic neurons than those from other body regions, namely 37 neurons (49 % of the total number of cells, or 61% of the cells with vestibulo-proprioceptive Table 2. Typical example of convergence of vestibular and neck afferents upon a neuron in the left thalamus (neuron No. 26 vestibular thalamic neurons received proprioceptive input from the arms (43 % of the vestibulo-proprioceptive cells) four of these responding to movements of both arms. More complex vestibulo-proprioceptive coactivation in a neuron of the left thalamus (VPLo trunk region). Another example of a more complex vestibulo-proprioceptive coactivation in a left thalamic neuron (VPLo trunk region). A thalamic relay nucleus in the Rhesus monkey (the dorsal VPI) was identified previously by the evoked potential technique in deep Nembutal anesthesia. These thalamic regions are characterized by cells with deep somatic proprioceptive input. This explains both, the close anatomical relations of vestibular and somatic-proprioceptive pathways and the close functional relations resulting in the high degree of convergence of both senses on vestibular nuclear, thalamic and cortical cells. Whether these differences represent real species differences or reflect variations in the delineation of thalamic nuclei by different anatomists (see Introduction, page 3), is not clear. It appears possible, that vestibular afferents accompanied by mainly joint position sense project to area 2v and vestibular afferents along with mainly muscle spindle afferents, to area 3a and therefore might already have separate thalamic relays. The present data on vestibular thalamic neurons are not in conflict with this view which certainly has to be substantiated by further experiments. If the vestibulo-thalamo-cortical projection is allied with the somatic proprioceptive system, as the present data suggest, connections should be essentially bilateral, because there is no direction of head movement involving one labyrinth alone. Correspondingly most thalamic cells (78 %) were found to receive bilabyrinthine input. When direction-dependent response patterns to labyrinth polarisation are compared for the cat vestibular nuclei (Fredrickson et al., 1965), and the Rhesus thalamus (Fig. 2) a strong connection between vestibular nuclei and thalamus on the same side may be assumed. Contralateral cathodic on-inhibition was more frequent in the thalamus than on-activation (column I in Fig. Under the assumption that round window polarisation mainly stimulates horizontal canal receptors, type I responses (activation upon ipsilateral horizontal angular acceleration, Duensing and Schaefer, 1958) are more frequent in the thalamus than type II responses (activation upon contralateral acceleration). This observation was made by B/ittner and Henn (1976) who found 2/3 responding cells of type I and only 1/3 of type II in the thalamus of alert rhesus monkeys upon natural horizontal rotation. In fact, this was the same proportion as in the vestibular nuclei of the rabbit (Duensing and Schaefer, 1958), suggesting an uncrossed vestibulo-thalamic connection. The combined tonic and phasic neuronal thalamic responses of Table 2 could reflect differences in time constant similar to observations of Fernandez and Goldberg (1971) in primary vestibular afferents. 80 % of our thalamic ventroposterior neurons responded to both vestibular and deep somatic proprioceptive input (Table 1), 61% of this proprioception came from neck and vertebral column afferents, 43 % from the arms, mostly contralateral but also ipsilateral, and 18% from the legs. The low visual input does not necessarily contradict Biittner and Henn (1976), who tested half of their vestibular thalamic neurons also with optokinetic stimuli (rotating vertical stripes viewed by the stationary non-paralyzed monkey). Such optokinetic responses are different from visual convergence on Vestibulo-Proprioceptive Convergence in Thalamus 231 thalamic cells. A surprising observation was that a few thalamic units exhibited more complex and highly organized response patterns such as illustrated in Figures 4 and 5. Similar proprioceptive input patterns have previously been found in the Rhesus area 2v field (Schwarz and Fredrickson, 1971a) and in the parietal cortex (Sakata et al., 1973; Duffy and Burchfiel, 1971; Mountcastle et al., 1975) but this is to our knowledge the first report of thalamic neurons of a comparable complexity. : Single unit recordings in the vestibular thalamus (VPI area) of the macaque. : Response patterns of vestibular thalamic neurons in the Rhesus monkey. : Nucleus ventroposterior inferior (VPI) as the vestibular thalamic relay in the Rhesus monkey. : Representation of vestibular afferents in somatosensory thalamic nuclei of the squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciurius). 39, 601-612 (1976) Liedgren, S.

In this part of the nucleus the dorsoventral axis of the medial prefrontal cortex is represented from caudal to rostra1 in the thalamus. o 1993 Wiley-Liss, Inc. Key words: retrograde axonal tracers, anterograde axonal tracers, agranular insular cortex, piriform cortex, entorhinal cortex, amygdala It is well established that the mediodorsal nucleus (MD) is the principal thalamic nucleus related to the prefrontal cortex, a large, diverse cortical region that is composed of several architectonic areas (Le Gros Clark and Boggon, '35; Walker, '36, '40b; Akert, '64; Jones, '85, Fuster, '89). Among other problems, there is little information on the thalamic representation of the agranular and dysgranular regions in the posterior orbital and medial prefrontal cortex. MDmg, in particular, occupies a unique position among the principal thalamic nuclei in that all of the ventral forebrain structures that project to it also project directly to the prefrontal cortex (Krettek and Price, '77b; Porrino et al., '81; Amaral and Price, '84; Carmichael and Price, '89; Carmichael et al., '94).

In some cases anterograde tracers have also been injected into the ventral forebrain regions that project to MD, in order to directly compare labeled thalamocortical cell populations with the patterns of ventral forebrain afferents, or into MD, in order to label thalamocortical efferents. The brain was removed and blocked at the posterior pole of the thalamus (approximately 4 mm rostral to the external auditory meatus). One series of 50 pm sections was mounted and stained with thionin, dehydrated, and coverslipped; in most cases, sections through the thalamus from an additional 25 pm series were mounted and stained for myelin (after Gallyas, '79). In this program the plot of each section through the thalamus was entered into the computer with a graphics tablet; blood vessels and the ventricular surfaces were used to align adjacent sections. The pattern of thalamocortical label in the prefrontal cortex in a few cases of anterograde tracer injections into MD will then be presented, since this closely correlates with the pattern of label from cortical injections. Although cytoarchitectural differences between the pars paramediana and the pars fibrosa are not readily apparent, there are differences in their thalamocortical projections (see below), in addition to the differences between them in myelin stained sections. Thalamocortical and corticothalamic projections of MD In all of the experiments reported here, small injections of two different retrograde fluorescent tracers were made into separate areas of the cortex, and in many cases an additional injection of an anterograde tracer was made into the cortex or a related limbic structure in the ventral forebrain. In such cases labeled cells are found throughout much of MD, obscuring the overall organization of thalamocortical projections seen with more restricted injections. Each projection will be described in turn, accompanied by a description of anterograde studies in which comparable thalamocortical or corticothalamic projections were labeled. The thalamocortical projection to area 11, in the rostral orbital cortex, is well illustrated by case OM13, which received injections of FB and DY into the rostral and central portions of area 11 (Fig. However, area 13a in the caudomedial corner of the orbital cortex appears to be a special case, which does not fit this general organization of thalamocortical projections to the orbital cortex. OM15 also has labeled cells ventral to MD, in the submedial thalamic nucleus (see below). The projections to areas 11 and 13 from the pars fibrosa are reciprocated by a corticothalamic projection from these areas (see also Russchen et al., '87). These confirm and extend the organization of thalamocortical projections demonstrated by retrograde tracing techniques. A distinct feature of this thalamocortical labeling is that it is patchy. The projection from area 32 to MD is concentrated in the pars caudodorsalis, reciprocating the thalamocortical projection to the medial prefrontal cortex. Double labeling of thalamocortical cells with fluorescent retrograde tracers. These provide information about the relationships of ventral forebrain afferents and thalamocortical cell populations in MD. This projection has a complex relation with thalamocortical projections to the orbital and agranular insular cortex. In agreement with other studies of amygdalothalamic projections to MD (Porrino et al., '81; Aggleton and Mishkin, '84; Russchen et al., '87), PHA-L labeled fibers are restricted to the pars fibrosa and pars paramediana. Connections of the prefrontal cortex with other thalamic nuclei In addition to retrogradely labeled cells in MD, the prefrontal cortical injections also produced cell labeling in other thalamic nuclei. These include the ventral anterior and ventromedial thalamic nuclei, the anteromedial nucleus, and the immediately adjacent intralaminar and thalamic midline nuclei, particularly rostral portions of the Fig. The three section lines indicated on the unfolded map and labeled A, B and C correspond to the photomicrographs in Figure 11A, B and C. paracentral thalamic nucleus and the centralis complex (centralis densocellularis, inferior, superior, and intermedialis). The submedial nucleus is situated just off the midline of the thalamus, ventral to the internal medullary lamina that separates it from the ventral edge of MD. MD pars fibrosa has been recognized in several studies of the thalamus, based on its dense myelination (e. g., Vogt, '09; Pines, '27; Namba, '58; Hassler, '591, but it has been generally thought to be coextensive with the magnocellular division of MD (Hassler, '59; Dewulf, '71). However, myeloarchitectural studies of the human thalamus have regularly described a caudomedial, myelin-poor part of MD (Hassler, '59; see also Dewulf, '71). Siwek and Pandya (91) also report a case with a tracer injection near the ventromedial corner of the cortex (their area 25), in which the thalamic label is distributed to the dorsal part of medial MD. This area may even receive most of its thalamic input from cells in dorsal MD pars fibrosa. Anterograde labeling of thalamocortical fibers to the prefrontal cortex is characterized by distinct bands or patches of thalamocortical afferents in the cortex (see Russchen et al., 87, for similar patterns of prefrontal corticothalamic cell labeling following injections of retrograde tracers into MD). It is not known how these bands or patches of thalamocortical label are related to corticocortical connections within the frontal cortex, which, as in other parts of the cortex, tend to be organized into patches or columns (Goldman-Rakic and Schwartz, 82; Carmichael and Price, 89). The patchy pattern of thalamocortical projections indicates that the general organization of interconnections between MD and the prefrontal cortex is underlain by a more complex organization. A corollary of this is that the cells labeled from retrograde tracer injections large enough to cross the bands of thalamocortical afferents should form distinct patches in MD that are separated by unlabeled gaps. Similarly, Siwek and Pandya (91) noted that there are label-free regions within corticothalamic projections to MD from the prefrontal cortex. The functional significance of this patchy organization of thalamocortical projections is unknown, but it is notable that fibers to MD from the amygdala, entorhinal cortex and other structures in the ventral forebrain are also distributed in patches or clusters within MD (Aggleton and Mishkin, 84; Russchen et al., 87). At present, there are little or no data to indicate whether the patchy patterns of thalamic afferents and the patchy distribution of thalamocortical projection cells are related to each other. Reciprocity of thalamocortical and corticothalamic connections with the medial prefrontal cortex. On the basis of their observations, Giguere and Goldman-Rakic (88) suggested that MD and the medial prefrontal cortex might represent an exception to the general rule that the principal thalamic relay nuclei have precisely reciprocal connections with the cerebral cortex. Because of this it is likely that the apparent lack of thalamocortical reciprocity between MD and medial prefrontal cortex seen in PRM17 and similar experiments is due other factors, such as a difference in the sizes of the effective anterograde and retrograde injection sites. It would appear, therefore, that the principle of precise reciprocity in thalamocortical and corticothalamic connections holds for MD and the prefrontal cortex, as it does for other principal thalamic nuclei and their related cortical areas. Although the amygdalothalamic projections in both species are very similar, there are subtle differences in that amygdaloid afferents in the rat are heaviest in medial MD but continue into central MD, while in the monkey these are heavy in both pars fibrosa and pars paramediana. Functional Considerations In the visual, auditory, or somatosensory systems, neural information reaches the cerebral cortex exclusively by a transthalamic relay in ""principal"" sensory thalamic nuclei (i.e., the lateral and medial geniculate nuclei, and the ventroposterior nucleus). Similarly, cerebellar influences reach the motor cortex via a relay in the ventrolateral thalamic nucleus. These fibers form part of a ""triangular"" circuit, by which limbic influences can reach the cortex both by the direct projections, and by the transthalamic pathway through MD (see also Porrino et al., '81; Ray and Price, '92). The major structures that project to medial MD but do not have direct projections to the cortex and therefore do not participate in a triangular circuit are the ventral pallidum, the globus pallidus, and the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra, all of which send apparently GABAergic fibers to the thalamus (Illinsky et al., '85; Russchen et al., '87; Groenewegen, '88; Kuroda and Price, '91a,b; Ray and Price, '92). Several cortical areas receive either direct amygdaloid afferents or transthalamic amygdaloid inputs, but not, both. Thus, areas 11 and 13 receive only very sparse amygdaloid inputs (Amaral and Price, '841, although they may be expected to receive transthalamic amygdaloid inputs through MD. Conversely, the medial prefrontal cortical areas 24 and 32 receive direct amygdaloid afferents, but are unlikely to receive any transthalamic amygdaloid input from MD, because the amygdala does not project to the pars caudodorsalis. In contrast, the direct projections from ventral forebrain structures to the prefrontal cortex arise from more numerous, smaller cells (e.g., McDonald, '87; Price et al., '91; Carmichael et al., '941, which would seem to be better situated to carry detailed sensory (olfactory) or limbic information of the sort that is usually considered to be conveyed to the cortex by a transthalamic route in other systems. It is clear from these considerations that MD serves a different role than simply to relay activity to the cortex, in the manner of the principal sensory or motor thalamic relay nuclei. The basis of sustained, delay-related activity is unclear, but Fuster ('89) has suggested that it is related to reverberatory activity in the reciprocal corticothalamic and thalamocortical projections. In the orbital and medial prefrontal cortex, reverberatory thalamocortical activity would be facilitated by simultaneous excitatory inputs from the amygdala or other parts of the ventral forebrain to both thalamus and cortex, especially in those areas where the direct and transthalamic pathways from the ventral forebrain to the cortex are well coordinated. In contrast, the GABA-ergic afferents to MD from the ventral pallidum, the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra and the globus pallidus (Illinsky et al., '85; Russchen et al., '87; Groenewegen, '88; Kuroda and Price, '91b; Ray and Price, '92) would presumably act to dampen thalamocortical reverberation. If thalamocortical activity provides a mechanism for sustaining activity related to Concentration on a particular task, inhibition of MD may block sustained activity, in order to switch between different patterns of thalamocortical activity, or to suppress unwanted thoughts or emotions (e.g. In the better studied motor system, experiments with deactivation of the globus pallidus indicate that it functions to suppress inappropriate activity in antagonistic muscle groups during movements, presumably via the GABA-ergic pallidal projection to the ventroanterior and ventrolateral thalamic nuclei (Mink and Thach, '91) . It may be suggested that the parallel pallidothalamic projections to MD have a similar role, but in relation to cognitive or affective functions instead of motor behavior.

Small injections of fluorescent retrograde tracers or anterograde tracers were made that were restricted to single architectonic areas of the cortex. In some cases anterograde tracers have also been injected into the ventral forebrain regions that project to MD, in order to directly compare labeled thalamocortical cell populations with the patterns of ventral forebrain afferents, or into MD, in order to label thalamocortical efferents. Stereotaxic injections of tracers were made, guided initially by the atlas of Szabo and Cowan ('84). The exact coordinates of each injection were determined by making electrophysiological recordings through the region of interest to identify brain landmarks, such as the boundary between gray and white matter and the ventral surface of the brain, which could be used to locate the desired injection site precisely (Russchen et al., '87). Tracer preparation and injection In each animal, two to four small injections of different axonal tracers were made into different parts of the forebrain. The retrograde tracers fast blue (FB) and diamidino yellow hydrochloride (DY; Dr. K. G. Illing; 2% in aqueous solution) were injected into the prefrontal or agranular insular cortex; in one case a solution of rhodamine-labeled microspheres (Rh) was also used. In many cases, anterograde tracers (3H-leucine or PHA-L) were also injected into the amygdala or other structures in the ventral forebrain. The retrograde tracers were backfilled into pipettes (0.25 mm inner diameter, 20-30 pm inner diameter at tip) and then injected immediately with a micropulse air pressure system (Amaral and Price, '83). The pipettes remained in place 15-30 min after each injection to prevent spread of tracer up along the pipette track. 3H-leucine (1 mCi/ml; Amersham and New England Nuclear) was evaporated to dryness and then reconstituted in buffer to a concentration of 80 pCi/pl; injections of 25-100 nl were made with the same air pressure injection system. PHA-L (Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin; Vector) was reconstituted in 10 mM phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, and injected iontophoretically (Gerfen and Sawchenko, '84). All injections except one (OM14, see Fig. Several experiments with injections of wheat germ agglutinin conjugated horseradish peroxidase (WGA-HRP) into MD were also available from earlier studies (Russchen et al., 87). In these cases 30-40 nl of 1% WGA-HRP in saline was injected into MD. Additionally, one case in which 3H-leucine was injected into MD, and four cases in which WGA-HRP was injected into MD (Russchen et al., 87), were examined. RESULTS We shall first present a description of the cytoarchitecture and myeloarchitecture of MD, and then the pattern of cell or fiber labeling in MD following small injections of fluorescent retrograde tracers or anterograde tracers in the orbital, agranular insular and medial prefrontal cortices. The pattern of thalamocortical label in the prefrontal cortex in a few cases of anterograde tracer injections into MD will then be presented, since this closely correlates with the pattern of label from cortical injections. Thalamocortical and corticothalamic projections of MD In all of the experiments reported here, small injections of two different retrograde fluorescent tracers were made into separate areas of the cortex, and in many cases an additional injection of an anterograde tracer was made into the cortex or a related limbic structure in the ventral forebrain. In all, label from 22 different injections were analyzed: 11 in the orbital cortex, six in the medial prefrontal cortex, three in the agranular insular cortex, and two in the depth of the principal sulcus (Fig. Four injections of anterograde tracers were made into structures in the ventral forebrain, two into the piriform cortex, one into the entorhinal cortex, and one into the amygdala (Fig. A number of other cases with anterograde tracer injections into the amygdala were also available from previous studies (Amaral and Price, '84; Russchen et al., '87). All of the retrograde tracer injections that were used for analysis were small, approximately 1.5 mm in diameter, and avoided the white matter deep to the cortex (Fig. These small injections labeled cells in a restricted portion of MD, with few labeled cells elsewhere in the nucleus. In contrast, injection sites which involved the white matter resulted in a more diffuse pattern of cell labeling in MD. In such cases labeled cells are found throughout much of MD, obscuring the overall organization of thalamocortical projections seen with more restricted injections. Experiments with retrogrude tracer injections into the orbital cortex. Following injections of retrograde tracers into the orbital cortex, labeled cells are concentrated in MD pars fibrosa, and, in some cases, in the pars paramediana. The thalamocortical projection to area 11, in the rostral orbital cortex, is well illustrated by case OM13, which received injections of FB and DY into the rostral and central portions of area 11 (Fig. 41, and by OM5, which received an injection of FB into the caudal part of this area. 6A), while the labeled cells from the more caudal injection in OM5 are located more ventrally, in the central part of the pars fibrosa (Fig. Cases OM14 and OM9 received injections into rostral area 12; the injection in OM14 slightly involved area 46, while the injection in OM9 was slightly more caudolateral and avoided area 46 (Fig. Two other injections into the caudomedial part of area 12 (area 120, not illustrated) produced a much more diffuse pattern of label. In OM12, an injection of DY was made into the lateral part of area 13 (Fig. In case OM5, in which DY was injected into a more caudomedial part of area 13, labeled cells are concentrated in paramedian MD, with somewhat fewer in fibrosa (Fig. These cells are ventral, as well as slightly caudal, to the cells labeled by the injection into area 11 in the same case. In a third case (OM8), an injection of FB' limited to area 13b labeled cells in the ventral half of pars fibrosa and pars paramediana (Fig. In case OM15, which received an injection of DY limited to this area (Fig. Experiments with anterograde tracer injections into the orbital cortex. After a PHA-L injection into the caudal part of area 13 (case OM14, Fig. The location and size of the tracer injections in the prefrontal cortex, shown on coronal sections (on the left) and on an unfolded map of the cortex (on the right). Note that one to three different tracers were injected in each experiment. In OM12 an injection of 3H-leucine was placed in the posterior piriform cortex. In OM5, an injection of 3H-leucine was No fibers are found in MD pars caudodorsalis or parvicellularis. In OM16, a more rostral injection of 3H- leucine into area 11 (Fig. Experiments with anterograde tracer injections into MD pars fibrosa. Several cases of injections of anterograde tracers (WGA-HRP or 3H-leucine) into MD pars fibrosa are available. Case OM14 received an injection of 3H-leucine that was centered in the lateral half of MD pars fibrosa and avoided the pars parvicellularis, pars caudodorsalis and pars paramediana (Fig 10). In OM7 a small injection of PHAL was made into the accessory basal nucleus of the amygdala. Other cases available for analysis received injections of WGA-HRP into MD. The green dots represent cells labeled from an injection of FB into rostral area 11, the black dots represent cells labeled from an injection of DY into a more caudal part of area 11, and the red dots represent anterograde axonal label from an injection of -leucine in area 32. The green dots represent cells labeled from an injection of FB into the caudal part of area 11, the black dots represent cells labeled from an injection of DY in the medial part of area 13 and the red dots represent anterogradely labeled axons from an injection of 3H-leucine in the entorhinal cortex. The crosses represent cells labeled from an injection of DY in the lateral part of area 13 and the circles represent anterogradely labeled axons from an injection of 3H-leucine in the piriform cortex. One of these is PRM17, in which an injection of WGA-HRP was centered upon MD pars fibrosa and slightly involved the pars paramediana and pars parvicellularis (Fig. The green dots represent cells labeled from an injection of rhodamine beads into the fundus of the principal sulcus (in area 461, the black dots represent cells labeled from an injection of DY in the rostral part of area 12 and the short red lines represent anterogradely labeled axons from an injection of PHA-L in area 13. The green dots represent cells labeled from an injection of FB into area 13b, the black dots represent cells labeled from an injection of DY in the ventral agranular insular area and the red dots represent anterogradely labeled axons from an injection of 3H-leucine in the same part of the ventral agranular insular area. Experiments with retrograde tracer injections into the agranular insular cortex. Two injections of retrograde tracers into this region illustrate this projection. Case OM8 received an injection of DY into area Iav, in addition to the injection of FB into area 13b described above (Fig. Most of the DY labeled cells are concentrated in the ventral part of paramedian MD, although a few are also found in pars fibrosa, where they are mostly ventral to the cells labeled from the more rostral injection in area 13b of the same case (Fig. The circles represent cells labeled from an injection of DY into area 13a and the dots represent cells labeled from an injection of FB into the dorsal agranular insular area. OM15 received an injection of FB into area Iad (Fig. Experiments with anterograde tracer injections into the agranular insular cortex. Case OMS also received a 3Hleucine injection into area Iav, just caudal to the DY injection in the same case (Fig. Experiments with anterograde tracer injections into MD pars paramediana. Our anterograde analysis of the projections of paramedian MD is therefore derived from cases in which tracers were injected into MD pars fibrosa, but involved the pars paramediana to varying extents. Of all the available cases, PRM17 (see above) received the most medial injection of WGA-HRP, heavily involving the pars paramediana as well as MD pars fibrosa (Fig. In contrast, the injection in the pars fibrosa in OM14 avoided the pars paramediana. Other cases with injections involving dorsal parts of MD pars fibrosa and MD pars caudodorsalis but not the MD pars paramediana (PRM18; see below) also have little or no label in the agranular insula. Experiments with injections of retrograde tracers into the medial prefrontal cortex. After an injection of FB into area 14 (OM6; Fig. OM7 received an injection of DY limited to the center of area 32 (Fig. In another case (OM4), an injection of FB into a more rostral part of area 32, which slightly involved area 10 (Fig. Finally, two cases are available in which DY was injected into different parts of rostral area 24. The injection in OM3 was located approximately 3 mm rostral to the genu of the corpus callosum, in area 24b of the nomenclature of Vogt et al. The injection in OM11 was positioned just dorsal to the genu of the corpus callosum, in areas 24a and 24b (Fig. Experiments with injections of anterograde tracers in the medial prefrontal cortex. An injection of 3H-leucine into area 32 in OM13 (Fig. This autoradiographic label is consistently dorsolateral and caudal to the cells in MD pars fibrosa that were retrogradely labeled from injections of FB and DY into area 11 in the same case (Figs. Experiments with injections of anterograde tracers in MD pars caicdodorsalis. Injections of anterograde tracers into medial MD label medial prefrontal cortex only if the caudodorsal division of MD is involved in the injection site. In many cases (OM14 and PRM17; see above), labeled afferents in medial prefrontal cortex are particularly sparse, and in each case the injection site spared the caudodorsal division of MD. Russchen et al., '871, while the WGA-HRP injection is centered upon the dorsolateral part of MD pars fibrosa, it also involves the pars caudodorsalis and pars parvicellularis (Fig. This injection resulted in dense anterograde labeling of cortex in the rostral part of the cingulate gyrus, including parts of areas 24, 32, and 9; equally dense label is found in the depths of the principal sulcus and in the rostral orbital cortex, particularly areas 11 and 13b (Fig. In most of the cases studied in which two contrasting fluorescent tracers were injected into different parts of the orbital and medial prefrontal cortex, very few double labeled cells were found in MD (roughly 1% of either single labeled cell population). In OM13, where the two injections were approximately 3 mm apart, closer than in any other case (in area 11, Fig. Such axonal spread may be elongated in the rostrocaudal dimension, because in OM8, in which the injections were placed rostrocaudal to each other and separated by about 5 mm (Fig. In two cases (OM14 and OM161 in which retrograde tracers were injected into this cortical region (Fig. In two other cases (OM 14 and PRM 18) in which injections of anterograde tracers were centered in MD pars fibrosa with little or no involvement of the pars parvicellularis, there is a dense band of axonal label in the fundus and ventral bank of the principal sulcus (Figs. Ventral forebrain afferents in MD In many of the experiments described above, injections of anterograde tracers were also made into parts of the ventral forebrain that send afferent fibers to MD. An injection of 3Hleucine was made into the rostral entorhinal cortex (into areas ER and EL^ ofAmaral et al., '87) in case OM5 (Fig. There is only sparse, patchy label in areas 13 and 11, and none in the parts of these areas that were injected with retrograde tracers in this same case. Case OM12, in addition to receiving an injection of DY into the lateral part of area 13 (see above), received an injection of 3H-leucine into the posterior piriform cortex (Fig. The labeled axons coincide with a few of the cells in the same region of MD that are retrogradely labeled from the injection of DY into rostrolateral area 13 in the same case, but avoid the densest clusters of labeled cells. In other cases, tracer injections into more caudal parts of area 13 (OM14, Fig. There is little or no axonal label in the rostrolateral part of area 13, in the region of the retrograde tracer injection. In a few cases we injected anterograde tracers into portions of the amygdaloid complex, in order to directly compare afferents in MD from the basal or accessory basal amygdaloid nuclei with cells in MD that project to prefrontal areas. One such case was OM7, in which a restricted PHA-L injection was made into the accessory basal nucleus (Fig. 5), in addition to the DY injection into area 32 described above. Connections of the prefrontal cortex with other thalamic nuclei In addition to retrogradely labeled cells in MD, the prefrontal cortical injections also produced cell labeling in other thalamic nuclei. The injection site of 3H-leucine in the left MD pars fibrosa of OM14, and the distribution of anterogradely labeled axons in prefrontal cortex, shown on an unfolded map of the cortex (see Fig. In case OM12, in which 3H-leucine was injected into the piriform cortex (Fig. In case OM15, in which DY was injected into area 13a (Fig. Photographs of anterograde axonal label in the prefrontal cortex of OM14, in which ""-leucine was injected into MD pars fibrosa. 31, following an injection of WGA-HRP in the medial part of MD. The dots represent cells labeled from an injection of FB in the area 14. In an earlier autoradiographic analysis of the projections of MD to prefrontal cortex, Tobais ('75) also found that only injections of 3H-leucine in the caudomedial portion of MD labeled the medial prefrontal cortex (see also Baleydier and Mauguiere, '80; Vogt et al., '87). The crosses represent cells labeled from an injection of DY in area 32, and the thin lines represent anterograde axonal label from an injection of PHA-L in the accessory basal nucleus of the amygdala. Siwek and Pandya (91) also report a case with a tracer injection near the ventromedial corner of the cortex (their area 25), in which the thalamic label is distributed to the dorsal part of medial MD. In agreement with these studies, injections of retrograde tracers into the medial prefrontal cortex, agranular insula or areas 11, 13, 13a or 13b of the orbital cortex label very few neurons in parvicellular MD. The dots represent cells labeled from an injection of DY in the area 24. Following a very large retrograde tracer injection in the dorsal bank of the principal sulcus (dorsal area 46), they found labeled cells in the dorsal part of medial MD, as well as many cells in lateral MD, while a similar injection in the ventrolateral convexity (area 12) labeled cells in lateral as well as medial MD. These have been best demonstrated by the retrograde tracer experiments with injections into the cortex. Comparison of retrogradely labeled cells from injections in rostra1 (stars) and caudal (circles) parts of area 11 (on the left) and anterogradely labeled axons from an injection of 3H-leucine into area 32 (on the right) in OM13. The distribution of anterograde axonal label in PRM18, following an injection of' WGA-HRP in the dorsal part of MD pars fibrosa and the adjacent rostra1 part of the pars caudodorsalis, shown on an unfolded map of the frontal cortex (see Fig. The distribution of anterograde and retrograde label in the region of the nucleus submedius (A and B; arrowheads) and in MD (C and D) following an injection of DY into area 13a in OM15 (left) and an injection of 3H-leucine into the piriform cortex in OM12 (right). A subtly different organization is seen with injections of anterograde tracers into MD. Anterograde labeling of thalamocortical fibers to the prefrontal cortex is characterized by distinct bands or patches of thalamocortical afferents in the cortex (see Russchen et al., 87, for similar patterns of prefrontal corticothalamic cell labeling following injections of retrograde tracers into MD). A corollary of this is that the cells labeled from retrograde tracer injections large enough to cross the bands of thalamocortical afferents should form distinct patches in MD that are separated by unlabeled gaps. Indeed, in most cases the retrogradely labeled cells in MD from cortical injections were concentrated in separate clusters (e.g., OM12, Fig. In another study with larger cortical injections Goldman-Rakic and Porrino (85) reported that neurons in the MD tended to be labeled in cell aggregates. Indeed, in PRM17, an injection of WGA-HRP in MD anterogradely labeled relatively few axons in the medial prefrontal cortex (Fig. Because of this it is likely that the apparent lack of thalamocortical reciprocity between MD and medial prefrontal cortex seen in PRM17 and similar experiments is due other factors, such as a difference in the sizes of the effective anterograde and retrograde injection sites. Cholinergic cells in the basal forebrain have also been reported to be labeled by injections of retrograde tracers into MD (Parent et al., '88), although it is difficult to rule out that the injections did not involve midline or intralaminar nuclei around MD.

In the present study WGA-HRP injections were placed in the different subdivisions of the posterior parietal cortex of the rhesus monkey to determine whether a similarly complex pattern also exists in the thalamocortical pathway. Additionally, in an attempt to determine whether there is an intranuclear specificity of projections from individual thalamic nuclei to different subdivisions of the parietal lobe, multiple retrograde fluorescent tracers were injected into the rostral to caudal sectors of the parietal lobe of the same animal. Different subdivisions of the parietal lobe appear to receive different sets of thalamic input. Thus the superior parietal lobule (SPL) projections are derived from more lateral regions in the thalamus, arising predominantly from the lateral posterior (LP) and pulvinar oralis (PO) nuclei, with additional contributions from the pulvinar lateralis (PL) and pulvinar medialis (PM) nuclei. The inferior parietal lobule (IPL), by contrast, receives its projections from more medial thalamic regions, its main thalamic input originating from PM, and aided by LP, PL, and PO. A topographical arrangement also exists in the thalamic projections to the rostral versus the caudal subdivisions of both the SPL and the IPL. Thus rostral parietal subdivisions receive projections from ventral regions within these thalamic nuclei, whereas caudal parietal afferents arise from the dorsal parts of these nuclei. It therefore seems that the increasing architectonic and functional complexity as one moves from rostral to caudal in the SPL and IPL appear to be reflected in the thalamic afferents. More rostral areas relate to modality-specific thalamic nuclei, whereas more caudal regions concerned with complex functions derive their input from multimodal and limbic nuclei. Key words: thalamocortical, parietal lobe, pulvinar, connections, retrograde tracers Preliminary findings of these studies were presented at the Society for Neuroscience Annual Meetings in New Orleans (Schmahmann and Pandya '86) and Washington, D.C.

This pattern of architectonic and connectional heterogeneity of the posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is reflected also in the projections to the thalamus. This contrasts with projections to thalamus from the rostral IPL (area PF), which are directed to the ventral posterior inferior (VPI), ventral posteromedial (VPM), suprageniculate (SG) and VL nuclei; from the mid-IPL (area PFG) to pulvinar (PO and Fig. Studies of projections to the parietal lobe from the thalamus have shown that these are derived predominantly from the ventroposterior. However, since the thalamoparietal projections are massive, it seems imperative that more detailed analysis of these pathways be available in order to develop a comprehensive understanding of the parietal lobe. In view of the recent more precise delineation of the projections to the thalamus from architectonically and connectionally defined subdivisions of the parietal lobe, it may be expected that a correspondingly detailed pattern of thalamocortical connections also exists. In the present study, therefore, the thalamic projections to the parietal lobe in the rhesus monkey were examined to determine the specific characteristics of the thalamic afferents to the different architectonic areas of the posterior parietal cortex. In addition to complementing and confirming the information obtained from the WGA-HRP cases, the fluorescent tracers enabled us to make comparisons within the same thalamus of projections to the SPL versus the IPL, and also of projections to the rostral versus the middle or caudal sectors of each lobule. METHODS In the first part of the investigation, the thalamoparietal projections were studied in 12 rhesus monkeys by using WGA-HRP histochemistry. In our hands it has been possible to identify thalamic nuclear boundaries with neutral red staining, but in addition we have verified the accuracy of our thalamic cytoarchitectonic parcellations by comparing these sections with others prepared using cresyl violet and thionin. For identification of thalamic nuclei in our material we have relied predominantly upon the architectonic maps of Olszewski ('52) used in conjunction with the descriptions according to Jones ('85) and Ilinsky and Kultas-Ilinsky ('87). The principal criteria used to identify the different thalamic nuclei and their subdivisions are the limiting fiber capsule, cellular features, and location. Located at the lateral and dorsal sector of the caudal parts of thalamus, the lateral posterior nucleus contains medium-size, darkly staining neurons that are evenly distributed and have moderate packing density. VLm (Jones' VMp) is the recipient of nigrothalamic afferents. Photomicrographs A to E are coronal sections through rhesus monkey thalamus in the rostrocaudal dimension, to illustrate most of the nuclei referred to in this study. A few neurons were also observed in this case in the anterior thalamic nucleus in its ventral (AV) and medial (AM) divisions. Apart from scattered neurons in the Pcn and CL nuclei, no other thalamic nucleus was observed to contain WGA-HRP-filled cells. In Figures 4 through 9, the distribution of labelled neurons (shown as black dots) is seen in the accompanying representative coronal sections through the thalamus, which progress from left to right in a rostrocaudal direction. Three separate injections of retrograde fluorescent dyes were placed in the left superior parietal lobule of a single animal, and the resulting retrogradely labelled neurons in the thalamus were charted (Fig. The distribution of neurons labelled with beads (shown as red dots) in the thalamus following injection of rostral area PE was similar to that observed in case 1. The pattern of thalamic neuron labelling (shown as green dots) following DY placement in area PEc resembled that observed in case 3. The bulk of the labelled neurons from all the injections appeared to lie mostly in the lateral regions of the thalamus. The thalamic labelling (shown as red dots) following bead injections into area PEc was similar to case 3 and the DY label in case 13-left hemisphere, being concentrated in LP, and in the PO nucleus to a smaller degree. As in the previous case, the entire extent of neuronal labelling appeared to be located in a somewhat lateral position in the thalamus. Diamidino yellow injection into rostral area PG produced thalamic labelling resembling that found in cases 9 and 10. Diagrams illustrating cases 3 and 4 with the WGA-HRP injections in areas PEc and caudal PEa, respectively, and the distribution of labelled neurons in thalamus. The ventral to dorsal arrangement of labelled thalamic neurons in this case according to the rostrocaudal location of the parietal injections was quite striking. The bulk of the labelled neurons from all three injection sites in the IPL were concentrated in a medial position in the thalamus when compared to the labelled neurons from the SPL. The intermediate to medial position within the thalamus of the labelled neurons from all the IPL injections is consistent with the Case 14- right hemisphere. DISCUSSION This study reveals strong, topographically organized projections from thalamus to the posterior parietal cortex (PPC). Although our results are in agreement with previous observations (Clark and Boggon, '35; Walker, '36; Locke, '60; Burton and Jones, '76; DeVito and Simmons, '76; Baleydier and Mauguiere, '77; Kasdon and Jacobson, '78; Pearson et al., '78; Jones et al., '79; Friedman et al., '83; Miyata and Sasaki, '83; Asanuma et al., '85; Duda et al., '89), they extend our understanding of the thalamoparietal connections by relating the connectivities of the different thalamic nuclei to newly defined architectonic areas in the parietal lobe (Pandya and Seltzer, '82), including the cortex buried within the intraparietal sulcus (Seltzer and Pandya, '86). In addition, the study demonstrates an intranuclear topography of thalamic neurons projecting to different architectonic regions of the parietal lobe. The heterogeneous origins of thalamic nuclear projections to the different regions of the posterior parietal cortex and the relative strengths of these projections are summarized in Table 1. The labelled neurons arising particularly from the PO and LP nuclei were observed in some instances to be distributed over a considerable rostrocaudal extent in two or three lamellae arranged roughly parallel to the reticular nucleus, This would correspond to the ""rods to columns"" thalamocortical organization as discussed by Junes and Friedman ('82). It is also apparent from our findings, however, that four other thalamic nuclear groups contribute substantial projections to the PPC in a specific manner. Diagrams illustrating cases 5 and 6 with the WGA-HRP injections, respectively, in areas PGm and the inferior aspect of areas 1 and 2, and the distribution of labelled neurons in thalamus. The thalamic projections to the PPC in our material correspond well with previous accounts of projections to thalamus from cortex (Walker, '36; Weber and Yin, '84; Yeterian and Pandya, '85) confirming the largely reciprocal nature of these connections. Mediolateral topography of projections It was apparent from the WGA-HRP study that some nuclei project to more than one cortical architectonic region, and conversely, some cortical regions are seen to receive afferents from multiple thalamic nuclei. The fluorescent tracers revealed that projections to the SPL tend to originate within central-lateral regions of the thalamus, as opposed to projections to IPL, which tend tu be located in central-medial positions (see Figs. Thus, whereas there may be a functional commonality of both the cortical region and the projecting thalamic nucleus, there may also be a functional specificity of each thalamic nuclear subregion corresponding to the functional properties of the discrete cortical target to which it projects.

SI versus PPC thalamic connectivity There is a specificity of thalamoparietal connections as one progresses from the primary somatosensory regions of the postcentral gyrus towards the association areas in the more caudal parts of the parietal lobe. 8) has no projections from VPM but receives its thalamic input from the pulvinar, LP, MD, and intralaminar nuclei. SPL versus IPL thalamic connections The strong and uniform projections of the ventroposterior nuclei to the primary somatosensory area are largely replaced in the posterior parietal cortex by intense projections from the lateral posterior and pulvinar nuclei. In addition, this is the only region of the SPL that receives projections from the limbic anterior thalamic nuclei, AM and AV. Diagrams illustrating cases 9 and 10 with the WGA-HRP injections in the central and dorsal parts of area PG, respectively, and the distribution of labelled neurons in thalamus. In the most caudal IPL, area Opt, the PM and LP projections are joined by heavy input from the limbic thalamic nuclei (Yakovlev et al., '60, Locke et al., '64), TAD, and the anterior nuclei (AV and AM). Putative functional properties of thalamic nuclei This differential thalamocortical connectivity may have functional significance. It is interesting to review the statement of Head and Homes ('11) who believed that the ""thalamus is the center of consciousness for certain elements of sensation, (and that) the feeling tone of somatic or visceral sensation is the product of thalamic activity."" Therefore, the demonstrated projections from the VL nucleus to the PPC may serve as an anatomical substrate for the feedback from the cerebellum via thalamus to the PPC. The VL projection from thalamus back to areas Opt and PGm could perhaps also convey from the cerebellum a modulating influence upon information necessary for cognitive aspects of behavior. This provides an example in the thalamocortical projection of the concept derived from the corticostriate pathway that reciprocally interconnecting cortical regions share common subcortical connections (Yeterian and Van Hoesen, '78). Pain syndromes involving the extremities have been described following lesions of the thalamus (Dejerine and Roussy, '06; DennyBrown and Chambers '58), as well as after lesions of the parietal white matter (Foix et al., '27; Davison and Schick, Fig. Diagrams illustrating cases 11 and 12 with the WGA-HRP injections in the caudal part of area POa and in Opt, respectively, and the distribution of labelled neurons in thalamus. The projections demonstrated here from the limbic thalamic nuclei LD as well as from AM and AV to area Opt suggests, perhaps, that the subcortical drive to the parietal lobe for the attentional/motivational/affective components of behavior are derived in part from these nuclei. It is interesting to note that the parahippocampal and presubicular regions have thalamic connections with LD and cortical connections with Opt, thus representing another example of the principle proposed by Yeterian and Van Hoesen ('78) as described above. Multimodal commonality in caudal SPL and IPL reflected in thalamic connectivity The two somatosensory association cortical trends, the one in the SPL and the other in the IPL, are shown in this study to have differential thalamic connections. They also both receive projections from limbic thalamic nuclei as well as from PM, which itself is related to the multimodal deeper layers of the superior colliculus (Harting et al., '80; Benevento and Standage, '83). Thus PGm receives pulvinar projections from PO and PL in addition to PM, whereas the Opt thalamic input from pulvinar is almost exclusively from PM. This appears to be reflected in the differential limbic thalamic input to these two regions as defined by the present study. The asterisks represent the rare thalamic nuclei that rue labelled in the fluorescent case but not in the WGA-HRPcases. The distribution of the resulting retrogradely labelled neurons in thalamus is shown by colored dots. Thus the PM projections to the IPL (possibly relaying information relevant for visuospatial perception), and the PI projections to inferotemporal areas (which may convey afferents important for visual object detection), extends the dichotomy of visual systems (Mishkin et al., '83) to the level of the thalamus.

This arrangement seem6 to be reflected in the thalamocortical projections as well. On the other hand, the multimodal regions in the caudal SPL and TPL receive inputs from multiple thalamic sites, including associative, intralaminar, and limbic thalamic nuclei. The possible functional significance of the dichotomy of thalamocortical connectivity patterns may be that they provide the subcortical framework whereby analytical properties are concentrated mostly in the modality-specific areas, whereas multiple inputs facilitate the synthesizing function characteristic of the multimodal regions. Finally, when evaluating the thalamic projections to the PPC, it is possible to discern a relationship that may perhaps be generalized to the thalamus and cortex as a whole. In the model of sequential cortical processing, primary somatosensory information arrives at the postcentral gyrus from the ventroposterior complex of the thalamus. Our study has shown that the posterior parietal association cortices receive distinctly different thalamic afferents than do the primary somatosensory cortices. Further, the afferents to architectonically specific cortical targets are derived from unique regions of the thalamic nuclei. This could conceivably imply that thalamic subpopulations of neurons may be the functional equivalent of the cortical architectonic regions with which they are reciprocally interconnected. The distribution of the resulting retrogradely labelled neurons in thalamus is shown by colored dots.

Additionally, in an attempt to determine whether there is an intranuclear specificity of projections from individual thalamic nuclei to different subdivisions of the parietal lobe, multiple retrograde fluorescent tracers were injected into the rostral to caudal sectors of the parietal lobe of the same animal. Diagram of the lateral and medial surfaces of rhesus monkey cerebral hemispheres to show a composite representation of WGA-HRP injection sites (cases 1 through 12) in the superior and inferior parietal lobules as well as in the cortex of the intraparietal sulcus. Four penetrations, each delivering 0.5 pl of tracer (total 2.0 pl), were made at each injection site. The order of the dye injections was altered in the second case with respect to the first, so as to verify the accuracy of the results, as the reliability and relative intensity of neuronal transport of each dye appear to be different. In both cases (13 and 14), the left hemisphere was injected in the SPL, and the right hemisphere in the IPL. The animals were anesthetized and the cortical injection sites located as described for the WGA-HRP cases. Thus an additional 12 parietal injection sites were available for analysis. 1A) were identified by inspection of the sulcal pattern, and two closely adjacent 0.05 pl injections of 7.5% WGA-HRP in an aqueous solution were made under direct visual guidance with a one microliter Hamilton syringe with a microdrive attachment.

Superior parietal lobule WGA-HRP injections The WGA-HRP injections in case 1 were placed in the rostral part of the SPL, area PE (Fig. In case 2, WGA-HRP injections were placed in the midportion of the upper bank of the intraparietal sulcus, area PEa, with some involvement also of the adjacent part of area PE (Figs. A small amount of spread of the injection to the lower bank was observed as well. The WGA-HRP injections in case 3 were placed in area PEc in the caudalmost portion of the SPL (Figs.

The injections in case 12 were confined to area Opt in the caudalmost part of the IPL (Fig. Diagrams illustrating cases 1 and 2, with placement of the WGA-HRP injections (shaded black regions) in areas PE and midportion of PEa, respectively. Fluorescent tracer injections Case 13 -left hemisphere. Three separate injections of retrograde fluorescent dyes were placed in the left superior parietal lobule of a single animal, and the resulting retrogradely labelled neurons in the thalamus were charted (Fig. Rhodamine latex microspheres (beads) were placed in the rostral area PE; diamidino yellow (DY) was injected more caudally into area PEc; and fast blue (FB) was injected into the medial convexity of the parietal lobe in area PGm. The distribution of neurons labelled with beads (shown as red dots) in the thalamus following injection of rostral area PE was similar to that observed in case 1. The fast blue injection in the medial parietal convexity area PGm resulted in intense labelling (shown as blue dots). A prominent feature in this case was the overall pattern of dorsoventral lamination of the labelled neurons noted particularly in the LP and pulvinar nuclei, following injection of different parts of the superior parietal lobule. Thus neurons labelled with beads after rostral PE injections were located ventrally in the LP nucleus and had a ventral predominance in the PO nucleus. Neurons labelled with FB following PGm injections were located most dorsally in the LP and PO nuclei. Neurons labelled with DY following injections in PEc occupied an intermediate position between these two collections. The bulk of the labelled neurons from all the injections appeared to lie mostly in the lateral regions of the thalamus. Three separate injections of fluorescent retrograde tracers were made in the left superior parietal lobule of a single rhesus monkey cerebral hemisphere.

The FB injection in rostral PE resulted in labelling (shown as blue dots) resembling case 1 and the bead injections in case 13-left hemisphere, being noted most prominently in the PO and LP nuclei. The thalamic labelling (shown as red dots) following bead injections into area PEc was similar to case 3 and the DY label in case 13-left hemisphere, being concentrated in LP, and in the PO nucleus to a smaller degree. The DY injections in area PGm resulted in labelled neurons (shown as green dots) clustered at the junction of the LP, PO, PL, and VPLc nuclei. The rostrally placed injections (FB) resulted in labelled neurons ventrally within the LP and PO nuclei; the PGm injections (DY) produced labelled neurons dorsally within the PO nucleus; and the placement of beads in area PEc resulted in labelled neurons dorsal to the FB in the LP nucleus, and in an intermediate position in the PO nucleus. In this hemisphere three injections of fluorescent retrograde tracers were placed in the inferior parietal lobule. Beads were injected rostrally in area PF; DY in the intermediate regions at rostral area PG; and FB in caudalmost IPL, area Opt (Fig. Diamidino yellow injection into rostral area PG produced thalamic labelling resembling that found in cases 9 and 10. Diagrams illustrating cases 3 and 4 with the WGA-HRP injections in areas PEc and caudal PEa, respectively, and the distribution of labelled neurons in thalamus. Thalamic labelling following the injection in Opt of FB was basically similar to cases 11 and 12. The ventral to dorsal arrangement of labelled thalamic neurons in this case according to the rostrocaudal location of the parietal injections was quite striking. The bulk of the labelled neurons from all three injection sites in the IPL were concentrated in a medial position in the thalamus when compared to the labelled neurons from the SPL. As in the previous case, the IPL of a single hemisphere was injected with three different fluorescent retrograde tracers. In this case, however, FB was placed in the rostral IPL, area PP; beads were injected into area PG; and DY was placed in caudalmost IPL, area Opt (Fig. Following FB injection into area PF dense concentrations of labelled neurons were present in the PO nucleus as well as in PM to a lesser degree. The paucity of label following this injection could be a result of problems inherent in the transport properties of the rhodamine latex microspheres. Despite this, the location of label in PM resembled the DY injection in case 13-right hemisphere and the WGA-HRP cases 9 and 10. Diamidino yellow injection in the caudal IPL, area Opt, resulted in labelling predominantly in the dorsal portion of the PM and to a lesser degree the PL nuclei. The intermediate to medial position within the thalamus of the labelled neurons from all the IPL injections is consistent with the Case 14- right hemisphere.

Wiesendanger and M. Wiesendanger Institut de Physiologie, Universit6 de Fribourg, Facult6 des Sciences, P6rolles, CH-1700 Fribourg, Switzerland Summary. The interrelationship of medial area 6 (supplementary motor area) with the thalamus was investigated by means of anterograde and retrograde tracing methods. Previous observations were confirmed that the thalamic relays to the motor areas are organized as crescent-shaped lamellae which transgress cytoarchitectonic boundaries. The thalamic VA-VL complex receiving fibres from areas 4 and medial area 6 ~lso sends fibres to these same areas. The thalamic relay to medial area 6 comprised the following subdivisions: VLo, VLc, area X of Olszewski, VLm and, to a smaller extent VA. 4. Labeling (mostly anterograde only) was also prominent in some thalamic compartments outside the 'motor' thalamus: R, CL, CM-Pf, MD, LP, PULo. It was noted that rostral and caudal injections into the medial area 6 resulted in different thalamic labeling: The rostral portion was found to be related mainly with VApc, area X and VLc, the central portion with VLo, and the caudal portion with VLc/VLo. The thalamic territory projecting to the precentral cortex is separate from the above relay and includes principally VPLo. The present anatomical labeling study is in agreement with the conclusion of SchelI and Strick (1984) that the SMA, especially its central portion, is an important target of basal ganglia outflow via the thalamic relay VLo. In addition consistent labeling was also found in thalamic subdivisions (area X, VLc) which had been found to receive cerebellar fibres. Offprint requests to: R. Wiesendanger (address see above) Key words: Supplementary motor cortex - Motor cortex - Monkey - Tracing studies - Thalamocortical relationship Introduction It is well known that the large thalamic nuclear complex which receives cerebellar, pallidal and nigral outflow is interconnected with motor cortical fields (Kievit and Kuypers 1977; Kiinzle 1978, 1979). Since, in anatomical studies, the sites of origin or of termination of a projection are described in relation to nuclear subdivisions, the complex thalamic parcellation according to cytoarchitectonic criteria becomes a critical issue. Furthermore, the cell-sparse zone was considered to be the thalamic relay to area 4 (although some uncertainty remained with respect to the 'peripheral' parts of the cell-sparse zone). However, subnuclens VLo was sometimes also included in the thalamic relay to the motor cortex (Strick 1976; Kfinzle 1976; Kievit and Kuypers 1977; Kalil 1978; Miyata and S asaki 1983), perhaps because the cell-sparse intervening zones were included in the VLo territory. Most recently, Schell and Strick (1984) presented evidence that VLo is the chief thalamic relay to the supplementary motor area (SMA) and that area X of Olszewski (1952) constitutes the thalamic relay to the premotor cortex (lateral area 6). On the other hand, the premotor cortex was considered as being under control of the cerebellum via its thalamic relay in area X. subnuclei of the thalamus which are known to receive cerebellar afferents. We will therefore detail our observations which suggest that the cerebellar source should be included in the systems which participate in the control of SMA output via the thalamus. After 2 or more days of postfixation, blocks of the brain containing the injections and the thalamus were cut coronally on a freezing microtome (50 ~tm sections). General features As expected, consistent labeling 'in the ipsilateral thalamic VA-VL complex has been found in all cases. In brief, the relatively large injections produced labeling in a curved 'lamella' or 'slab' which extended rostro-caudally through the VL complex of the thalamus. These patches can also be followed over a few mm in rostro-caudal direction (the thalamic 'rods', cf. Kievit and Kuypers 1977; Miyamata and Sasaki 1983) that the labeled thalamic 'bands' or 'slabs' transgressed cytoarchitectonic subdivisions were confirmed. Noteably, labeling occurred also in portions of medial thalamic nuclei and the reticular nucleus, often in continuity with the labeled 'slab' in the VL complex. 3 and 6), subthalamic nucleus, red nucleus. B-G Rostro-caudal levels representing transverse sections through the thalamus. Some of the labeling in the anterior thalamic nucleus (AM) and in the ventrolateral portions of MD can probably be ascribed to the involvement of the cingulate cortex.

A Lamella of anterograde and retrograde labeling in ventrolateral thalamus. In these reports, a considerable amount of anterograde and retrograde labeling was found to occupy the 'motor' thalamus. The paper of Jfirgens (1984) aims at a more global view of the SMA connections with cortical and subcortical structures in the new world monkey, and it was therefore not focused on the involvement of subcompartments within the 'motor thalamus '1. However, the detailed study of Schell and Strick (1984) was specifically concerned with the reciprocal corticothalamic relationship. Their main result was that the SMA is dominated by the thalamic input from the VLo nucleus. We can confirm that the VLo consti1 In a personal note, Jtirgens comments that retrogradely labeled cells were present in VLo, VLc and VLm tutes a major thalamic relay for the central portion of the SMA. Our observations thus extend those of Schell and Strick (1984) by indicating that the thalamic connectivity of the SMA is not homogenous. Our results show that there is a gradual shift in the 'hot spots' of labeled thalamic territory as one moves from caudal SMA to rostral SMA: the latter portion was found to be dominated by VA, area X and VLc, the central portion by VLo, and the caudal-most portion by VLc and VLo. Several experienced investigators have pointed to the difficulties in establishing with necessary precision the exact boundaries of thalamic subnuclei (e.g. Since there is good evidence that the thalamic subnuclei X, VLc, and perhaps also parts of VLo, receive cerebellar afferents and since these structures were labeled in our study, we suggest that medial area 6 is controlled, via the thalamus, by both pallidal and cerebellar outflow (which does not mean that the two systems converge onto the same thalamic compartments). post., Commissura posterior; CLS, Nucleus centralis superior lateralis; For, Fornix; GM, Nucleus geniculatus medialis; In p.c., Nucleus interstitialis of the posterior commissure; LD, Nucleus lateralis dorsalis; Li, Nucleus limitans; LP, Nucleus lateralis posterior; MDmc, Nucleus medialis dorsalis, pars magnocellularis; MDmf, Nucleus medialis dorsalis, pars multiformis; MDpc, Nucleus medialis dorsalis, pars parvocellularis; NRmc, Nucleus ruber magnocellularis; NRpc, Nucleus ruber parvocellularis; Pcn, Nucleus paracentralis; Pf, Nucleus parafascicularis; Pul.i., Nucleus pulvinaris inferior; Pul.l., Nucleus pulvinaris lateralis; Pul.m., Nucleus pulvinaris medialis; Pul.o., Nucleus pulvinaris oralis; R, Nucleus reticularis thalami; SMA, Supplementary motor area; STh, Nucleus subthalamicus; VAmc, Nucleus ventralis anterior, pars magnocellularis; VApc, Nucleus ventralis anterior, pars parvocellularis; VLc, Nucleus ventralis lateralis, pars caudalis; VLm, Nucleus ventralis lateralis, pars medialis; VLo, Nucleus ventralis lateralis, pars oralis; VLps, Nucleus ventralis lateralis, pars postrema; VPI, Nucleus ventralis posterior inferior; VPLo, Nucleus ventralis posterior lateralis, pars oralis; VPM, Nucleus ventralis posterior medialis; WGA-HRP, Horseradish peroxidase conjugated to the lectin wheat germ agglutinin; X, Area X; ZI, Zona incerta References Akert K, Woolsey CN (1954) Ventrolateral nuclear group of the thalamus and its projection upon the precentral cortex of the monkey.

It was noted that rostral and caudal injections into the medial area 6 resulted in different thalamic labeling: The rostral portion was found to be related mainly with VApc, area X and VLc, the central portion with VLo, and the caudal portion with VLc/VLo. With injections of the caudal and middle portions of the SMA, we obtained results which were similar to those of Schell and Strick (1984). However, injection of the lectin-bound enzyme HRP in a rostral portion of the SMA clearly also labeled area X of Olszewski and VLc, i.e. In 6 monkeys, various portions of the SMA were injected (3 ARG, 3 WGA-HP, P); in 2 monkeys, the arm and the face areas of the precentral cortex were injected with WGA-HRP, and in 1 monkey, the hindlimb-tail area was injected with labeled aminoacids. Details of the injections and survival times are listed in Table 1. Total volumes of 0.2-1.5 ~tl were pressureinjected with a 1 Ixl syringe (2 cases) or through a glass capillary (2 cases). After 2 or more days of postfixation, blocks of the brain containing the injections and the thalamus were cut coronally on a freezing microtome (50 ~tm sections). HRP-Histochemistry A 10% solution of WGA-HRP (Sigma) was pressure-injected through a glass-capillary in volumes of 0.2-0.3 ~tl. The sites of injections in the precentral cortex were chosen according to the lowest threshold points for eliciting movements (trains of 12 pulses at 330 Hz applied directly to the cortical surface). One block was processed within 2 days, the 2 other blocks were frozen at-80 ~ C in 2-methyl buthane which made it possible to process this material at Table 1 93 Experiment Area injected Applicated solution total survival quantity activity time ~tCi (days) 82-43 anterior SMA WGA-HRP 10% 80-153 anterior SMA 3H Leucine- + area 24 Proline (L-P) 7%47 middle third 3H L-P of SMA 80-152 posterior SMA 3H L-P 82-15 middle third WGA-HRP 10% of SMA + area 24 82-16 posterior SMA WGA-HRP 10% + area 4 (tail area) 79-46 preeentral tail 3H L-P area + area 24 83-82 precentral WGA-HRP 10% arm area 84-01 precentral WGA-HRP 10%o face area 0.3 ~tl 15 rd 135 0.2 ~tL 24 1.0 ~tl 90 0.8 r 0.3 ~l 0.2 ~1 24 0.4 ~tl 0.4 ~tl later stages without apparent loss of enzyme activity. The reconstructed spheres of injections, as shown in the illustrations, included the centre of the injections with an evenly dark background but excluded the surrounding volume with prominently labeled perikarya and the faint halo (Mesulam 1982). The general pattern was in agreement with previous observations in monkey material with motor cortex injections of HRP (Jones et al. 1983b) and SMA injections (Schell and Strick 1984; Jfirgens 1984). In brief, the relatively large injections produced labeling in a curved 'lamella' or 'slab' which extended rostro-caudally through the VL complex of the thalamus. On coronal sections patches of labeling can be distinguished, especially with the smaller injections. The more rostral the injection, the more labeling occurred in medial cell groups of the MD nucleus, Pcn and CL. In the following, the results from injections in various rostro-caudal portions of the SMA are grouped together (cf. The diameter of the injected sphere was about 3 mm. A similarly placed WGA-HRP injection in case 82-15 was somewhat larger and encroached on the ventral bank of the cingulate sulcus. B Sphere of the injection in the SMA (see also Fig. A Relatively small injection confined to the upper bank of the cingulate sulcus, bordering granular frontal cortex. The injection sphere was largely confined to the most rostral portion of the agranular medial cortex, but may 'have spread slightly into the most posterior portion of medial area 9 (Fig. On the right are outlines of coronal sections with the core zone (crosshatched) and the lightly stained surrounding halo (hatched) of the injection site. Note that the effective injection zone was probably confined to the agranular cortex. In comparison to the case with an injection in the middle third of SMA, the maximum of labeling was shifted from VLo to area X which now seems to be the most prominently labeled subnucleus. The injection in the ARG case 80-153 was small; in its a-p position it corresponded to the case described above but encroached on area 24 of the anterior cingulate cortex. VLo was, however, hardly labeled in this case with the small injection. The sphere of injection was just rostral to area 4 with the tail and hindlimb representation. The corresponding ARG case (79--46) had a slightly more rostral injection which avoided area 4, but instead invaded definitely the ventral bank of the cingulate sulcus. Comparison with area 4 injections Face area injection (84-01). Arm area injection (83-82). The injection, made under electro-physiological control, provided a labeling pattern which was very similar to that of the face case. There was also some VLo involvement just lateral to area X. Leg-tail area injection (80-152). A rather small injection (sphere of about 1 mm diameter) of tritiated aminoacids may have involved mainly the tail area of the primary motor cortex. With respect to the sources of afferents to area X, we found that a precentral face area injection labeled a lamella in the most lateral portion of area X (besides more lateral territory). It demonstrates that in all our SMA injections of WGA-HRP with a long survival time, transcellular labeling occurred contralaterally in the deep cerebellar nuclei.",,,
