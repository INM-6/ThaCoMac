This is a problem when thalamic stereotaxy is again being use clinically. The cause usually imputed is the historical conflict between two main schools; the Vogt and the 'Anglo-American' (Michigan); which used different nomenclatures. In fact; the reasons are more profound and serious. A combination of them led to: an archaic; rigid conception of the 'thalamic nucleus'; overexploitation of cytoarchitectonic technique; comparative anatomy and cortical connections; under exploitation of subcortical afferent territories; recent misuse of these territories; hesitations in the use of the VA-VL system; and opposition between ventral ('relay') and dorsal ('associative') 'nuclei'. Previous and current parcellations and nomenclatures for the lateral region finally appeared inappropriate. Before presenting a new parcellation and nomenclature for the lateral region; we explain why we did not adopt one of most common or of recently proposed nomenclatures; and were led to make our own. This is established according to rational and historically grounded rules. Precise definition of thalamic elements is provided. A thalamic 'region' is a gross topographic division corresponding to the former nuclei. A 'territory' is defined as the cerebral space filled by afferent endings from one source. When having a distinct topography in a region; a given territory makes a 'subregion'. For each of the studied 'motor' territories a review was made of its known cortical projections. The thalamic space where neurons project to a given cortical target constitutes a 'source space'. Topographical comparison of the sources spaces with territories reveals that there is often no coincidence between different (afferent or efferent) neuronal set spaces. It appears that source spaces are coincident in the pallidal and nigral territories but not in the cerebellar territory where two topographically distinct source spaces could be distinguished. A 'thalamic nucleus' is defined as the intersection of a thalamocortical source space with one territory. A rapid review of the general anatomy of the diencephalon is made. The ('dorsal') thalamus is divided into 'allo-' and 'isothalamus'; the latter with 'bushy' and 'microneurons'. The lateral region is isothalamic. The 'motor thalamus' makes the anterior part of the lateral region. The present work aims to analyse the functional anatomy of the 'motor thalamus' by using precise topography and three-dimensional analysis of the subcortical territories receiving from the cerebellar nuclei (part II); the medial nucleus of the pallidum (part III) and the pars reticulata and mixta of the substantia nigra (part IV). Large injections were used to obtain the maximal extent of each territory. A major deficiency of previous studies was inadequate cartography. Reliance on ventricular (CA-CP) landmarks observed by use of orthogonal teleradiography is mandatory. A study was made of intra- and interspecific variations and their effect on stereotactic and cartographic precision in macaques. All three subcortical motor afferent territories to the motor thalamus of macaques are examined in precise cartography with three dimensional reconstructions; rotations and 'reslicing'. The motor thalamus is made up of three topographically distinct and separate territories: cerebellar; pallidal territory and nigral. They cover the entire anterior part of the lateral region. There is no polar subdivision without lower afferents in front of the pallidal and nigral territories and thus no reason for isolating a nucleus lateralis polaris or a polar VA. The cerebellar territory is continuous and dense; in front of the somesthetic nucleus and everywhere separate from it. It has a complex three-dimensional shape; strongly convex anteriorly. Its caudal portion is dorsal to the somesthetic nucleus. In the lateral dimension it extends from the lateral region to the paralaminar region of the medial complex. The cerebellar territory; primarily dentate; also contains islands of axons from the interposed and fastigial nuclei; the vestibular nuclei and the spinothalamic tract. It corresponds to at least five previously isolated 'cytoarchitectonic nuclei'. It cannot be seen as a single entity but contains distinct ventrolateral and a mediodorsal source spaces. Its complex three-dimensional shape; its particular intersection with different cytoarchitectonic nuclei and source spaces; can be simplified into two nuclei: nucleus lateralis intermedius lateralis (LIL) and nucleus intermedius mediodorsalis (LIM). The stereotacticians' ventralis intermedius (Vim) is discussed at length. Tremorosynchronous and kinesthetic neurons are essentially located ventrally and laterally. The intrathalamic topography observed in human patients indicates that the stereotacticians's target (where tremorosynchronous neurons are found) is within lateral cerebellar territory receiving cerebellar afferents and projecting to the motor cortex. The hypothesis that the nucleus interpositus could be particularly involved is presented. The nucleus lateralis intermedius lateralis (LIL) of the present study is equivalent in macaques to the stereotacticians' 'V.im.e'; object to interspecific differences. The pallidal territory is anterior to and separate from the cerebellar territory; in the oral part of the lateral region. It covers the whole ventrodorsal extent of the thalamus. It is crescent shaped; strongly curved in the anteroposterior dimension; and ends dorsally over the cerebellar territory. It is also curved in the mediolateral dimension following the lateral border of the thalamus. The territorial border does not coincide with cytoarchitectonic borders. The pallidal territory includes various cytoarchitectonic nuclei. Only the cloud-like ventral oral part is easily recognizable on purely cytoarchitectonic criteria. The others are cytoarchitectonically ill defined. The pallidal territory may be delineated using calbindin immunostaining. Other targets of the medial pallidum are the central (centre-median-parafascicular) complex; the pedunculo-pontine complex and the lateral habenula. In relation to its afferent and efferent connections; the pallidal thalamus seems to be made up of a single piece and could be considered as the lateral oral subregion or nucleus (LO). The nigrothalamic connection has been ignored for a long time and remains undervalued. Precise topographic description shows that the nigral territory is much more extensive than usually thought. It is located medial to the pallidal territory; and as the most rostral of all three subcortical afferent territories; is named nucleus lateralis rostralis (LR). Orally the nigral territory covers the whole ventrodorsal extent of the lateral region of the thalamus. A posterior part ends ventrally and medially just in front of the central complex. A topographically distinct amygdalar forms a subdivision named nucleus Lateralis Rostralis pars medialis (LRM). A posterodorsal part ends in the anterior paralaminar part of the medial complex; in front of the cerebellar territory. Islands of nigral terminations are observed within the medial nucleus. Three dimensional studies and artificial reslicing shows a posteroanterior sequence of the lemniscal; cerebellar; pallidal and nigral territories. The three motor territories extend over the whole ventrodorsal extent of the dorsal region. There appears to be no opposition of ventral to dorsal nuclei. Nuclei of the lateral region are thus given the first adjective Lateralis. The second adjective is from the initial sequence devisted by C. Vogt; caudalis-intermedia-oralis; to which we add rostralis. The lemniscal territory is named subregio Lateralis Caudalis with two parts: nucleus Laeralis Caudalis Lateralis (LCL) and nucleus Laeralis Caudalis Medialis (LCM). The cerebellar territory is named subregio Lateralis Intermedia with two nuclei: nucleus Laterlis Intermedius Lateralis (LIL); which is the main source to the motor cortex; and nucleus Lateralis Intremedius Medialis (LIM). The pallidal territory is subregio or nucleus Lateralis Oralis (LO). The nigral territory is subregio or nucleus Lateralis Rostralis (LR) with a paricular pars made by the amygdalar coterritory (LRM). An atlas of the macaque motor thalamus; comprising twelve levels; is presented; with mean dimensions for Macaca mulatta. Boundaries are not primarily cytoarchitectonic but topographic territories and sources spaces. This produces a modified parcellation of the macaque thalamus.

In this chapter we review the brain's strategies for keeping track of fast; saccadic eye movements. One way it does this is by monitoring copies of saccadic motor commands; or corollary discharges. It has been difficult to identify corollary discharge signals in the primate brain; although in some studies the influence of corollary discharge; for example on visual processing; has been found. We propose four criteria for identifying corollary discharge signals in primate brain based on our experiences studying a pathway from superior colliculus; in the brainstem; through mediodorsal thalamus to frontal eye field; in the prefrontal cortex. First; the signals must originate from a brain structure involved in generating movements. Second; they must begin just prior to movements and represent spatial attributes of the movements. Third; eliminating the signals should not impair movements in simple tasks not requiring corollary discharge. Fourth; eliminating the signals should; however; disrupt movements in tasks that require corollary discharge; such as a double-step task in which the monkey must keep track of one saccade in order to correctly generate another. Applying these criteria to the pathway from superior colliculus to frontal eye field; we concluded that it does indeed convey corollary discharge signals. The extent to which cerebral cortex actually uses these signals; particularly in the realm of sensory perception; remains unknown pending further studies. Moreover; many other ascending pathways from brainstem to cortex remain to be explored in behaving monkeys; and some of these; too; may carry corollary discharge signals.,FRONTAL EYE FIELD; MONKEY SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; ORIENTING GAZE SHIFTS; HEAD-FREE CAT; RHESUS-MONKEY; TECTORETICULOSPINAL SYSTEM; VISUAL-CORTEX; REVERSIBLE INACTIVATION; VISUOMOTOR FUNCTIONS; CENTRAL THALAMUS

oxidase patches: a new cytoarchitectonic feature of monkey visual cortex,In normal macaque monkeys a histochemical stain for cytochrome oxidase activity revealed a striking pattern of regularly spaced patches in primary visual striate area  V cortex The patches were most obvious in layers II and III but also in layers I IV b V and VI only in layers IV c and IV a were they absent The patches were oval shaped about  by  pm and aligned into rows spaced about  pm apart Along each row a patch was located about every  pm often patches in neighbouring rows were aligned creating a square array T heir density was about one patch per  mm  by  pm in opercular cortex The patches were also labelled preferentially by stains for lactate dehydrogenase succinate dehydrogenase acetylcholinesterase AChE and myelin In V a coarser pattern of broad parallel stripes labelled by cytochrome oxidase lactate dehydrogenase and AChE was present The cytochrome oxidase patches were absent in non-prim ate species like the cat mink tree shrew mouse rat rabbit and ground squirrel However they were present in all prim ate species examined including the rhesus cynomolgus owl and squirrel monkey baboon bushbaby and hum an While more species should be tested it appears that the patches are a cytoarchitectonic feature unique to prim ate visual cortex In the owl monkey patches of anterogradely transported horseradish peroxidase HRP were found in layers IV ca III and II after injection of the tracer into the lateral geniculate nucleus lgn They coincided exactly with the position of patches in adjacent sections processed for cytochrome oxidase A similar result was obtained in the macaque except that patches were not present in layer IV ca These experiments established that the cytochrome oxidase patches receive a direct patchy projection from the lateral geniculate body However retrogradely filled layer VI cells in the owl monkey bore no regular relation to the patches In the macaque the honeycomb of geniculate terminals in layer IV a matched a similar honeycomb pattern of cytochrome oxidase staining In the Nissl stain three sublayers in layer IV a were identified the honeycomb was located in layer IV ap In V in the owl monkey the parallel stripes of enhanced cytochrome oxidase activity received a direct projection from lgn or pulvinar In the macaque after intraocular injection of Hproline the rows of patches in layers II and III lay in register with ocular dominance columns seen by transneuronal radioautography in layer IV c In another macaque one eye was removed and the cortex stained for cytochrome oxidase AChE and Nissl substance after six months survival In layer IV c light and dark bands corresponding to the ocular dominance columns were visible surprisingly the dark cytochrome oxidase bands matched the light AChE and Nissl bands The set of bands belonging to the missing eye was determined by examining cytochrome oxidase staining and proline radioautographs in another macaque that sustained severe eye injury by Hproline injection In striate cortex bands of radioactive label from the injured eye matched ocular dominance columns appearing more lightly stained by cytochrome oxidase In the macaque tested six months after enucleation in every other row the cytochrome oxidase patches appeared pale and shrunken These lighter rows fit into precise register with the lighter ocular dominance columns in layer IV c confirming the correspondence between rows of patches and ocular dominance columns demonstrated by proline injection AChE staining of patches was similarly affected by eye removal The effect of visual deprivation upon cytochrome oxidase staining was tested in two monocularly sutured macaques In the lgn no effect was detected In visual cortex wide light columns alternating with thin dark columns were observed in layer IV In one m acaque the ocular dominance columns were labelled independently by H R P injection into a deprived lgn lamina The H R P labelled ocular dominance columns fit within the pale cytochrome oxidase columns this establishes that monocular deprivation causes a relatively greater loss of enzyme activity in ocular dom inance columns belonging to the closed eye However there was also loss of cytochrome oxidase staining along the borders of the normal eye dominance columns indicating that ocular dominance columns in layer IV are subdivided into core zones flanked by border strips that are susceptible to loss of cytochrome oxidase activity with suture of either eye The core zones are the same width as the rows of cytochrome oxidase patches and correspond to the dark bands seen in Liesegang stains of normal macaque striate cortex In two adult cats the effect of monocular lid suture at  d old was assessed no effect upon cytochrome oxidase staining in lgn or cortex was observed The optic disc representation in visual cortex was studied by -deoxyglucose radioautography and cytochrome oxidase staining after eye removal or lid suture in m acaque monkeys It appeared as a pale oval  times longer than the optic disc a distortion probably required to m aintain overall isotrophy in magnification factor Patches were present in the disc representation although ocular dominance columns are absent they appeared rounder and more widely separated In the temporal cresent patches were also present They were larger rounder and less densely spaced than patches in binocular cortex Deoxyglucose mapping in a macaque monkey monocularly stimulated with a display of parallel black and white stripes of irregular width and spacing rotated through all orientations has resulted in patches in the upper layers over ocular dominance columns corresponding to the open eye These patches match cytochrome oxidase patches situated in every other row thus suggesting that cells located in cytochrome oxidase patches respond to all orientations of stimulus Macaques binocularly stimulated with vertical or horizontal stripes show a complicated pattern of deoxyglucose uptake overlapping extensively with the pattern of cytochrome oxidase patches In one monkey the right eye was removed and  d later the animal was stimulated with vertical stripes Deoxyglucose radioautography and cytochrome oxidase staining combined in single tissue sections each revealed a matching pattern of ocular dominance columns in layer IV In the upper layers dots of radioautographic label were present matching cytochrome oxidase patches in alternate rows In foetal monkeys at E- the laminar pattern of cytochrome oxidase staining in visual cortex was remarkable for a prominent wide band of intense activity in layer IV b and upper IV ca absent in mature macaques In tangential section patches were visible in layers II III and in layer IV b -IV ca which indicates that patches form in monkey visual cortex before birth The functional significance of the patches remains uncertain It has been suggested that the visual field is analysed in visual cortex by small modules containing several hypercolumns of each stimulus variable The cytochrome oxidase patches may constitute the anatomical correlate of these proposed modules,
