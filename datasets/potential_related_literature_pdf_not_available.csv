This is a problem when thalamic stereotaxy is again being use clinically. The cause usually imputed is the historical conflict between two main schools; the Vogt and the 'Anglo-American' (Michigan); which used different nomenclatures. In fact; the reasons are more profound and serious. A combination of them led to: an archaic; rigid conception of the 'thalamic nucleus'; overexploitation of cytoarchitectonic technique; comparative anatomy and cortical connections; under exploitation of subcortical afferent territories; recent misuse of these territories; hesitations in the use of the VA-VL system; and opposition between ventral ('relay') and dorsal ('associative') 'nuclei'. Previous and current parcellations and nomenclatures for the lateral region finally appeared inappropriate. Before presenting a new parcellation and nomenclature for the lateral region; we explain why we did not adopt one of most common or of recently proposed nomenclatures; and were led to make our own. This is established according to rational and historically grounded rules. Precise definition of thalamic elements is provided. A thalamic 'region' is a gross topographic division corresponding to the former nuclei. A 'territory' is defined as the cerebral space filled by afferent endings from one source. When having a distinct topography in a region; a given territory makes a 'subregion'. For each of the studied 'motor' territories a review was made of its known cortical projections. The thalamic space where neurons project to a given cortical target constitutes a 'source space'. Topographical comparison of the sources spaces with territories reveals that there is often no coincidence between different (afferent or efferent) neuronal set spaces. It appears that source spaces are coincident in the pallidal and nigral territories but not in the cerebellar territory where two topographically distinct source spaces could be distinguished. A 'thalamic nucleus' is defined as the intersection of a thalamocortical source space with one territory. A rapid review of the general anatomy of the diencephalon is made. The ('dorsal') thalamus is divided into 'allo-' and 'isothalamus'; the latter with 'bushy' and 'microneurons'. The lateral region is isothalamic. The 'motor thalamus' makes the anterior part of the lateral region. The present work aims to analyse the functional anatomy of the 'motor thalamus' by using precise topography and three-dimensional analysis of the subcortical territories receiving from the cerebellar nuclei (part II); the medial nucleus of the pallidum (part III) and the pars reticulata and mixta of the substantia nigra (part IV). Large injections were used to obtain the maximal extent of each territory. A major deficiency of previous studies was inadequate cartography. Reliance on ventricular (CA-CP) landmarks observed by use of orthogonal teleradiography is mandatory. A study was made of intra- and interspecific variations and their effect on stereotactic and cartographic precision in macaques. All three subcortical motor afferent territories to the motor thalamus of macaques are examined in precise cartography with three dimensional reconstructions; rotations and 'reslicing'. The motor thalamus is made up of three topographically distinct and separate territories: cerebellar; pallidal territory and nigral. They cover the entire anterior part of the lateral region. There is no polar subdivision without lower afferents in front of the pallidal and nigral territories and thus no reason for isolating a nucleus lateralis polaris or a polar VA. The cerebellar territory is continuous and dense; in front of the somesthetic nucleus and everywhere separate from it. It has a complex three-dimensional shape; strongly convex anteriorly. Its caudal portion is dorsal to the somesthetic nucleus. In the lateral dimension it extends from the lateral region to the paralaminar region of the medial complex. The cerebellar territory; primarily dentate; also contains islands of axons from the interposed and fastigial nuclei; the vestibular nuclei and the spinothalamic tract. It corresponds to at least five previously isolated 'cytoarchitectonic nuclei'. It cannot be seen as a single entity but contains distinct ventrolateral and a mediodorsal source spaces. Its complex three-dimensional shape; its particular intersection with different cytoarchitectonic nuclei and source spaces; can be simplified into two nuclei: nucleus lateralis intermedius lateralis (LIL) and nucleus intermedius mediodorsalis (LIM). The stereotacticians' ventralis intermedius (Vim) is discussed at length. Tremorosynchronous and kinesthetic neurons are essentially located ventrally and laterally. The intrathalamic topography observed in human patients indicates that the stereotacticians's target (where tremorosynchronous neurons are found) is within lateral cerebellar territory receiving cerebellar afferents and projecting to the motor cortex. The hypothesis that the nucleus interpositus could be particularly involved is presented. The nucleus lateralis intermedius lateralis (LIL) of the present study is equivalent in macaques to the stereotacticians' 'V.im.e'; object to interspecific differences. The pallidal territory is anterior to and separate from the cerebellar territory; in the oral part of the lateral region. It covers the whole ventrodorsal extent of the thalamus. It is crescent shaped; strongly curved in the anteroposterior dimension; and ends dorsally over the cerebellar territory. It is also curved in the mediolateral dimension following the lateral border of the thalamus. The territorial border does not coincide with cytoarchitectonic borders. The pallidal territory includes various cytoarchitectonic nuclei. Only the cloud-like ventral oral part is easily recognizable on purely cytoarchitectonic criteria. The others are cytoarchitectonically ill defined. The pallidal territory may be delineated using calbindin immunostaining. Other targets of the medial pallidum are the central (centre-median-parafascicular) complex; the pedunculo-pontine complex and the lateral habenula. In relation to its afferent and efferent connections; the pallidal thalamus seems to be made up of a single piece and could be considered as the lateral oral subregion or nucleus (LO). The nigrothalamic connection has been ignored for a long time and remains undervalued. Precise topographic description shows that the nigral territory is much more extensive than usually thought. It is located medial to the pallidal territory; and as the most rostral of all three subcortical afferent territories; is named nucleus lateralis rostralis (LR). Orally the nigral territory covers the whole ventrodorsal extent of the lateral region of the thalamus. A posterior part ends ventrally and medially just in front of the central complex. A topographically distinct amygdalar forms a subdivision named nucleus Lateralis Rostralis pars medialis (LRM). A posterodorsal part ends in the anterior paralaminar part of the medial complex; in front of the cerebellar territory. Islands of nigral terminations are observed within the medial nucleus. Three dimensional studies and artificial reslicing shows a posteroanterior sequence of the lemniscal; cerebellar; pallidal and nigral territories. The three motor territories extend over the whole ventrodorsal extent of the dorsal region. There appears to be no opposition of ventral to dorsal nuclei. Nuclei of the lateral region are thus given the first adjective Lateralis. The second adjective is from the initial sequence devisted by C. Vogt; caudalis-intermedia-oralis; to which we add rostralis. The lemniscal territory is named subregio Lateralis Caudalis with two parts: nucleus Laeralis Caudalis Lateralis (LCL) and nucleus Laeralis Caudalis Medialis (LCM). The cerebellar territory is named subregio Lateralis Intermedia with two nuclei: nucleus Laterlis Intermedius Lateralis (LIL); which is the main source to the motor cortex; and nucleus Lateralis Intremedius Medialis (LIM). The pallidal territory is subregio or nucleus Lateralis Oralis (LO). The nigral territory is subregio or nucleus Lateralis Rostralis (LR) with a paricular pars made by the amygdalar coterritory (LRM). An atlas of the macaque motor thalamus; comprising twelve levels; is presented; with mean dimensions for Macaca mulatta. Boundaries are not primarily cytoarchitectonic but topographic territories and sources spaces. This produces a modified parcellation of the macaque thalamus. Each level is described and compared to Olszewski's equivalent level. The new atlas can be used confidently for stereotactic purpose in macaques of various species.,primate; motor system; cerebellum; basal ganglia; thalamus; SINGLE-UNIT ANALYSIS; POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; THALAMOCORTICAL PROJECTION NEURONS; VENTRAL SPINOTHALAMIC PATHWAYS; MEDIAN-PARAFASCICULAR COMPLEX; MONKEY SOMATOSENSORY CORTEX; POSTERIOR PARIETAL CORTEX; SUPPLEMENTARY EYE FIELD; SOMATIC SENSORY CORTEX; DORSAL COLUMN NUCLEI

In this chapter we review the brain's strategies for keeping track of fast; saccadic eye movements. One way it does this is by monitoring copies of saccadic motor commands; or corollary discharges. It has been difficult to identify corollary discharge signals in the primate brain; although in some studies the influence of corollary discharge; for example on visual processing; has been found. We propose four criteria for identifying corollary discharge signals in primate brain based on our experiences studying a pathway from superior colliculus; in the brainstem; through mediodorsal thalamus to frontal eye field; in the prefrontal cortex. First; the signals must originate from a brain structure involved in generating movements. Second; they must begin just prior to movements and represent spatial attributes of the movements. Third; eliminating the signals should not impair movements in simple tasks not requiring corollary discharge. Fourth; eliminating the signals should; however; disrupt movements in tasks that require corollary discharge; such as a double-step task in which the monkey must keep track of one saccade in order to correctly generate another. Applying these criteria to the pathway from superior colliculus to frontal eye field; we concluded that it does indeed convey corollary discharge signals. The extent to which cerebral cortex actually uses these signals; particularly in the realm of sensory perception; remains unknown pending further studies. Moreover; many other ascending pathways from brainstem to cortex remain to be explored in behaving monkeys; and some of these; too; may carry corollary discharge signals.,FRONTAL EYE FIELD; MONKEY SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; ORIENTING GAZE SHIFTS; HEAD-FREE CAT; RHESUS-MONKEY; TECTORETICULOSPINAL SYSTEM; VISUAL-CORTEX; REVERSIBLE INACTIVATION; VISUOMOTOR FUNCTIONS; CENTRAL THALAMUS
