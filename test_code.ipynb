      "Distribution of the dopamine innervation in the macaque and human thalamus We recently defined the thalamic dopaminergic system in primates it arises from numerous dopaminergic cell groups and selectively targets numerous thalamic nuclei Given the central position of the thalamus in subcortical and cortical interplay and the functional relevance of dopamine neuromodulation in the brain detailing dopamine distribution in the thalamus should supply important information To this end we performed immunohistochemistry for dopamine and the dopamine transporter in the thalamus of macaque monkeys and humans to generate maps in the stereotaxic coronal plane of the distribution of dopaminergic axons The dopamine innervation of the thalamus follows the same pattern in both species and is most dense in midline limbic nuclei the mediodorsal and lateral posterior association nuclei and in the ventral lateral and ventral anterior motor nuclei This distribution suggests that thalamic dopamine has a prominent role in emotion attention cognition and complex somatosensory and visual processing as well as in motor control Most thalamic dopaminergic axons are thin and varicose and target both the neuropil and small blood vessels suggesting that besides neuronal modulation thalamic dopamine may have a direct influence on microcirculation The maps provided here should be a useful reference in future experimental and neuroimaging studies aiming at clarifying the role of the thalamic dopaminergic system in health and in conditions involving brain dopamine including Parkinsons disease drug addiction and schizophrenia Dopamine; Thalamus; Monkey; Human; Primate; Dopamine transporter; Parkinson; Schizophrenia; Addiction;\n",

      "A thalamic nucleus specific for pain and temperature sensation THE existence of a posterolateral thalamic relay nucleus for pain and temperature sensation was postulated in  on the basis of the stroke-induced analgesia and thermanaesthesia found paradox-ically in patients with thalamic pain syndrome Pain or tempera-ture sensations can be evoked in humans by electrical stimulation in a vaguely defined region of the posterolateral thalamus Here we use anterograde tracing and single unit recordings to demon-strate that there is a distinct nucleus in the posterior thalamus of the macaque monkey that receives a dense topographic input from spinothalamic lamina I neurons and in which almost all neurons are nociceptive- or thermoreceptive-specific Immunohistochemical staining showed that this nucleus is defined by a dense calbindin-positive fibre plexus in the macaque so we applied the same stain-ing method to sections of human thalamus We found a nearly identical fibre plexus localized within a distinct nucleus that is cytoarchitectonically homologous to the lamina I relay nucleus in the macaque thalamus The stereotaxic coordinates of this nucleus and its location relative to the main somatosensory representation fit clinical descriptions of the pain-producing region in humans We conclude that this is a specific thalamic nucleus for pain and temperature sensation in both monkey and human nan\n",

      "The primate motor thalamus The functional parcellation of the motor thalamus of primates has suffered from serious historical and technical drawbacks which have led to extreme confusion This is a problem when thalamic stereotaxy is again being use clinically The cause usually imputed is the historical conflict between two main schools the Vogt and the Anglo-American Michigan which used different nomenclatures In fact the reasons are more profound and serious A combination of them led to an archaic rigid conception of the thalamic nucleus overexploitation of cytoarchitectonic technique comparative anatomy and cortical connections underexploitation of subcortical afferent territories recent misuse of these territories hesitations in the use of the VA-VL system and opposition between ventral relay and dorsal associative nuclei Previous and current parcellations and nomenclatures for the lateral region finally appeared inappropriate Before presenting a new parcellation and nomenclature for the lateral region we explain why we did not adopt one of most common or of recently proposed nomenclatures and were led to make our own This is established according to rational and historically grounded rules Precise definition of thalamic elements is provided A thalamic region is a gross topographic division corresponding to the former nuclei A territory is defined as the cerebral space filled by afferent endings from one source When having a distinct topography in a region a given territory makes a subregion For each of the studied motor territories a review was made of its known cortical projections The thalamic space where neurons project to a given cortical target constitutes a source space Topographical comparison of the sources spaces with territories reveals that there is often no coincidence between different afferent or efferent neuronal set spaces It appears that source spaces are coincident in the pallidal and nigral territories but not in the cerebellar territory where two topographically distinct source spaces could be distinguished A thalamic nucleus is defined as the intersection of a thalamocortical source space with one territory A rapid review of the general anatomy of the diencephalon is made The dorsal thalamus is divided into allo- and isothalamus the latter with bushy and microneurons The lateral region is isothalamic The motor thalamus makes the anterior part of the lateral region The present work aims to analyse the functional anatomy of the motor thalamus by using precise topography and three-dimensional analyses of the subcortical territories receiving from the cerebellar nuclei part II the medial nucleus of the pallidum part III and the pars reticulata and mixta of the substantia nigra part IV Large injections were used to obtain the maximal extent of each territory A major deficiency of previous studies was inadequate cartography Reliance on ventricular CA-CP landmarks observed by use of orthogonal teleradiography is mandatory A study was made of intra- and interspecific variations and their effect on stereotactic and cartographic precision in macaques All three subcortical motor afferent territories to the motor thalamus of macaques are examined in precise cartography with three dimensional reconstructions rotations and reslicing The motor thalamus is made up of three topographically distinct and separate territories cerebellar pallidal territory and nigral They cover the entire anterior part of the lateral region There is no polar subdivision without lower afferents in front of the pallidal and nigral territories and thus no reason for isolating a nucleus lateralis polaris or a polar VA The cerebellar territory is continuous and dense in front of the somesthetic nucleus and everywhere separate from it It has a complex three-dimensional shape strongly convex anteriorly Its caudal portion is dorsal to the spmesthetic nucleus In the lateral dimension it extends from the lateral region to the paralaminar region of the medial complex The cerebellar territory primarily dentate also contains islands of axons from the interposed and fastigial nuclei the vestibular nuclei and the spinothalamic tract It corresponds to at least five previously isolated cytoarchitectonic nuclei It cannot be seen as a single entity but contains distinct ventrolateral and a mediodorsal source spaces Its complex three-dimensional shape its particular intersection with different cytoarchitectonic nuclei and source spaces can be simplified into two nuclei nucleus lateralis intermedius lateralis LIL and nucleus intermedius mediodorsalis LIM The stereotacticians ventralis intermedius Vim is discussed at length Tremorosynchronous and kinesthetic neurons are essentially located ventrally and laterally The intrathalamic topography observed in human patients indicates that the stereotacticianss target where tremorosynchronous neurons are found is within lateral cerebellar territory receiving cerebellar afferents and projecting to the motor cortex The hypothesis that the nucleus interpositus could be particularly involved is presented The nucleus lateralis intermedius lateralis LIL of the present study is equivalent in macaques to the stereotacticians Vime subject to interspecific differences The pallidal territory is anterior to and separate from the cerebellar territory in the oral part of the lateral region It covers the whole ventrodorsal extent of the thalamus It is crescent shaped strongly curved in the anteroposterior dimension and ends dorsally over the cerebellar territory It is also curved in the mediolateral dimension following the lateral border of the thalamus The territorial border does not coincide with cytoarchitectonic borders The pallidal territory includes various cytoarchitectonic nuclei Only the cloud-like ventral oral part is easily recognizable on purely cytoarchitectonic criteria The others are cytoarchitectonically ill defined The pallidal territory may be delineated using calbindin immunostaining Other targets of the medial pallidum are the central centre-médian-parafascicular complex the pedunculo-pontine complex and the lateral habenula In relation to its afferent and efferent connections the pallidal thalamus seems to be made up of a single piece and could be considered as the lateral oral subregion or nucleus LO The nigrothalamic connection has been ignored for a long time and remains undervalued Precise topographic description shows that the nigral territory is much more extensive than usually thought It is located medial to the pallidal territory and as the most rostral of all three subcortical afferent territories is named nucleus lateralis rostralis LR Orally the nigral territory covers the whole ventrodorsal extent of the lateral region of the thalamus A posterior part ends ventrally and medially just in front of the central complex A topographically distinct amygdalar coterritory forms a subdivision named nucleus Lateralis Rostralis pars medialis LRM A posterodorsal part ends in the anterior paralaminar part of the medial complex in front of the cerebellar territory Islands of nigral terminations are observed within the medial nucleus Three dimensional studies and artificial reslicing shows a posteroanterior sequence of the lemniscal cerebellar pallidal and nigral territories The three motor territories extend over the whole ventrodorsal extent of the dorsal region There appears to be no opposition of ventral to dorsal nuclei Nuclei of the lateral region are thus given the first adjective Lateralis The second adjective is from the initial sequence devised by C Vogt caudalis-intermedius-oralis to which we add rostralis The lemniscal territory is named subregio Lateralis Caudalis with two pars nucleus Lateralis Caudalis Lateralis LCL and nucleus Lateralis Caudalis Medialis LCM cerebellar territory is named subregio Lateralis Intermedia with two nuclei nucleus Lateralis intermedius Lateralis LIL which is the main source to the motor cortex and nucleus Lateralis Intremedius Medialis LIM The pallidal territory is subregio or nucleus Lateralis Oralis LO The nigral territory is subregio or nucleus Lateralis Rostralis LR with a particular pars made by the amygdalar coterritory LRM An atlas of the macaque motor thalamus comprising twelve levels is presented with mean dimensions for Macaca mulatta Boundaries are not primarily cytoarchitectonic but topographic territories and sources spaces This produces a modified parcellation of the macaque thalamus Each level is described and compared to Olszewskis equivalent level The new atlas can be used confidently for stereotactic purpose in macaques of various species Primate; Motor system; Cerebellum; Basal ganglia; Thalamus;\n",

      "An autoradiographic study of the projections of the pretectum in the rhesus monkey (macaca mulatta): evidence for sensorimotor links to the thalamus and oculomotor nuclei Autoradiographic tracing methods were used to determine the differential projections of the pretectal nuclei in the rhesus monkey in relation to their inputs The sublentiform SL and olivary ON nuclei receive projections from the visual cortex superior colliculus SC and an equal bilateral projection from the retina The nucleus of the posterior commissure NPC and its subdivisions do not receive any of these inputs The projections of the pretectum involve a number of structures within the thalamus and brain stem and there are differences in the projection targets of the pretectal region which receives direct visual input ie SL and ON and the region which does not ie nucleus of the posterior commissure NPC For example while all pretectal regions project within the pretectum and to the SC accessory oculomotor nuclei reticular formation intralaminar nuclei and hypothalamus it is only the retino-recipient zone which projects to rostral regions such as the visceral oculomotor nuclei the lateral pulvinar the border between the lateral pulvinar and medial pulvinar the oral pulvinar as well as to the thalamic reticular nucleus ventral lateral geniculate nucleus zona incerta and other structures It is concluded that the retina SC and cortex which influence the visceral oculomotor nuclei can only do so by virtue of their projections to the pretectum and that any consideration of accommodative and pupillary reflexes must view the pretectum as an obligatory link through which various structures can influence the intrinsic musculature of the eye In contrast to the SC the pretectum does not project to any of the visual relay nuclei of the thalamus such as the inferior pulvinar which project to the visual cortices Instead the pretectum projects directly to visuomotor visceromotor and arousal systems nan\n",

      "Acetylcholinesterase histochemistry in the macaque thalamus reveals territories selectively connected to frontal; parietal and temporal association cortices The patterns of histochemical staining for acetylcholinesterase AChE activity in the macaque thalamus were analyzed and compared with the distribution of cells and terminals labeled from injections of axonal tracers in the dorsolateral and orbital prefrontal cortex in area a of the posterior parietal cortex and in the polysensory cortex of the superior temporal sulcus AChE histochemistry is very useful in delineating the thalamic nuclei connected with the association cortex and in uncovering thalamic subdivisions that are barely evident on cytoarchitectonic grounds Moreover AChE activity reveals previously unrecognized heterogeneities within several thalamic nuclei like the ventral anterior VA where a new ventromedial subdivision VAvm is described the medial pulvinar PuIM or the mediodorsal nucleus MD In this nucleus three distinct chemical domains are present the medial ventral and lateral sectors characterized by low moderate and high AChE activities respectively The staining pattern of the lateral sector is markedly heterogeneous with patches of intense AChE activity surrounded by a moderately stained matrix The MD medial sector is connected with the orbitofrontal cortex whereas the AChE-rich patches in the lateral sector are selectively connected with the dorsolateral prefrontal parietal and temporal association cortices In the PulM a dorsomedial AChE-rich patch is selectively connected with the orbitofrontal cortex whereas the surrounding territory which shows moderate AChE activity is preferentially connected with the parietal and temporal cortices Chemically specific domains in the anterior ventral anterior midline and intralaminar thalamic nuclei are also connected with the examined association cortices These findings indicate that the topographic patterns of the thalamo-cortical connections of primate association areas conform to the chemical architecture of the thalamus This implies that because each cortical area is connected to a particular set of thalamic regions the influence of the thalamus on cortical function is exclusive for each area highly diverse among the various association areas and subject to a wide range of modulation at the thalamic level Mediodorsal nucleus; Medial pulvinar nucleus; Anterior thalamic nuclei; Midline thalamic nuclei; Intralaminar thalamic nuclei; AChE; acetylcholinesterase; AD; anterodorsal nucleus; AM; anteromedial nucleus; AMdc; anteromedial nucleus; densocellular part; AV; anteroventral nucleus; Cdc; central nucleus; densocellular part; CeM; central medial nucleus; Cif; central nucleus; inferior part; Cim; central nucleus; intermediate part; CL; central lateral nucleus; Clc; central nucleus; latocellular part; CnMd; centromedian nucleus; Cs; central nucleus; superior part; Csl; central nucleus; superior lateral part; HRP; horseradish peroxidase; HRP-WGA; peroxidase labeled wheat germ agglutinin; LD; lateral dorsal nucleus; Li; nucleus limitans; LP; lateral posterior nucleus; MD; mediodorsal nucleus; MDI; mediodorsal nucleus; lateral sector; MDm; mediodorsal nucleus; medial sector; MDv; mediodorsal nucleus; ventral sector; Pcn; paracentral nucleus; Pf; parafascicular nucleus; Pt; paratenial nucleus; Pull; inferior pulvinar nucleus; PulM; medial pulvinar nucleus; PulL; lateral pulvinar nucleus; Pv; paraventricular nucleus; R; reticular nucleus; Re; nucleus reuniens; SG; suprageniculate nucleus; STP; superior temporal polysensory area; TMB; tetramethylbenzidine; VA; ventral anterior nucleus; VAmc; ventral anterior nucleus; magnocellular subdivision; VApc; ventral anterior nucleus; parvocellular subdivision; VAvm; ventral anterior nucleus; ventromedial subdivision; VLo; ventral lateral nucleus; oral subdivision;\n",

      "Independence and merger of thalamocortical channels within macaque monkey primary visual cortex: Anatomy of interlaminar projections An important issue in understanding the function of primary visual cortex in the macaque monkey is how the several efferent neuron groups projecting to extrastriate cortex acquire their different response properties To assist our understanding of this issue we have compared the anatomical distribution of VI intrinsic relays that carry information derived from magno- M and parvocellular P divisions of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus between thalamic recipient neurons and interareal efferent neuron groups within area VI We used small iontophoretic injections of biocytin placed in individual cortical laminae of area VI to trace orthograde and retrograde inter- and intralaminar projections In either the same or adjacent sections the tissue was reacted for cytochrome oxidase CO which provides important landmarks for different efferent neuron populations located in CO rich blobs and CO poor interblobs in laminae  as well as defining clear boundaries for the populations of efferent neurons in laminae A and B This study shows that the interblobs but not the blobs receive direct input from thalamic recipient C neurons the interblobs receive relays from mid C neurons believed to receive convergent M and P inputs while blobs receive indirect inputs from either M or P or both pathways through layers B which receives M relays from layer Cα and A which receives P relays directly from the thalamus as well as from layer Cβ The property of orientation selectivity most prominent in the interblob regions and in layer B may have a common origin from oriented lateral projections made by mid C spiny stellate neurons While layer B efferents may emphasize M characteristics and layer A efferents emphasize P characteristics the dendrites of their constituent pyramidal neurons may provide anatomical access to the other channel since both blob and interblob regions in layers  have anatomical access to M and P driven relays despite functional differences in the way these properties may be expressed in the two compartments Parallel pathways; Area VI; Vision; Biocytin; Cytochrome oxidase;\n",

      "Laminar Termination Patterns of Thalamic; Callosal; and Association Afferents in the Primary Auditory Area of the Rhesus Monkey Thalamic callosal and association afferents to the primary auditory koniocortex area KA were investigated in rhesus monkeys with the aid of anterograde tract tracing techniques radioactively labeled amino acids wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase WGA-HRP and the Fink-Heimer silver impregnation method Different patterns of anterograde label in KA were produced by radioactively labeled amino acid injections in the contralateral primary auditory area the ipsilateral medial geniculate body MGB or auditory association cortex of the superior temporal gyrus STG Thalamic afferents from the MGB were found throughout KA in layers IV and III where the density waxed and waned forming regular patches of higher density label separated by areas of less dense label Callosal afferents from the contralateral auditory cortices were found in layers IV III and II in larger more spatially separated and irregular patches In contrast association afferents from the auditory association cortex of the STG were found in a continuous band in layer I To determine the extent to which the patches of callosal afferents overlap with or interdigitate between the high-density thalamic clusters two types of double anterograde labeling experiments were undertaken In one set of experiments isotope injections of the MGB were made in conjunction with transection of the corpus callosum in the same animal In another set of experiments isotope injections of the MGB were made in one hemisphere and an injection of WGA-HRP was made in the opposite supratemporal plane including KA in the same animal Both approaches demonstrate that the patches of callosal afferents in KA mainly occur between the high-density patches of thalamic afferents although there is a variable degree of overlap at their periphery Thus it seems that thalamic and callosal inputs to KA are organized in a largely complementary fashion while input from the lateral association cortex is continuous and overlaps both When considered in light of pertinent anatomical and physiological studies in a variety of species it appears that the areas mainly occupied by callosal or thalamic inputs may be differentially involved in frequency analysis and sound localization respectively nan\n",

      "The organization of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits: Open interconnected rather than closed segregated Anatomical findings in primates and rodents have led to a description of several parallel segregated basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits leading from a distinct frontocortical area via separate regions in the basal ganglia and the thalamus back to the frontocortical area from which the circuit originates One of the questions raised by the concept of parallelism is whether and how the different circuits interact The present Commentary proposes that interaction is inherent in the neural architecture of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits This proposal is based on the re-examination of the data on the topographical organization of the frontocortical-basal ganglia connections which indicates that each circuit-engaged striatal region sends divergent projections to parts of both substantia nigra pars reticulata and the internal segment of the globus pallidus each ventral striatal region sends divergent projections to parts of ventral pallidum substantia nigra pars reticulata and globus pallidus and this segregation is maintained at subsequent thalamic and frontocortical levels This results in an asymmetry in the frontal cortex-basal ganglia relationships so that while each frontocortical subfield innervates one striatal region each striatal region influences the basal ganglia output to two frontocortical subfields Because of this asymmetry at least one of the frontocortical targets of a given circuit-engaged striatal region is not the source of its frontocortical input Since this organization is inconsistent with an arrangement in closed segregated circuits we introduce the concept of a split circuit A split circuit emanates from one frontocortical area but terminates in two frontocortical areas Thus a split circuit contains at least one open striato-fronto-cortical pathway that leads from a circuit-engaged striatal region to a frontocortical area which is a source of a different circuit In this manner split circuits are interconnected via their open pathways The second striato-fronto-cortical pathway of a split circuit can be another open pathway or it can re-enter the frontocortical area of origin forming a closed circuit On the basis of the available anatomical data we tentatively identified a motor an associative and a limbic split circuit each containing a closed circuit and an open pathway The motor split circuit contains a closed motor circuit that re-enters the motor and premotor cortical areas and an open motor pathway that terminates in the associative prefrontal cortex The associative split circuit contains a closed associative circuit that re-enters the associative prefrontal cortex and an open associative pathway that terminates in the premotor cortex The limbic split circuit contains a closed limbic circuit that re-enters the limbic prefrontal cortex an open limbic pathway that terminates in the associative prefrontal cortex and possibly an additional open limbic pathway terminating in the motorpremotor cortices Possible functional implications of this open interconnected organization of the basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits are discussed AGI; lateral agranular cortex; AGm; medial agranular cortex; ACA; anterior cingulate area; AIA; agranular insular area; C-P; caudate-putamen; DA; dopamine; ENK; enkephalin; FEF; frontal eye field; GP; globus pallidus; GPe; globus pallidus; external segment; GPi; globus pallidus; internal segment; IC-P; lateral part of the caudate-putamen; IVM; lateral part of the ventromedial thalamic nucleus; M; primary motor cortex; MD; mediodorsal thalamic nucleus; MDmc; mediodorsal thalamic nucleus; magnocellular subdivision; MDm; mediodorsal thalamic nucleus; medial segment; MD; mediodorsal thalamic nucleus; lateral segment; MDce; mediodorsal thalamic nucleus; central segment; NAcc; nucleus accumbens; PFC; prefrontal cortex; PL; prelimbic cortex; PMC; premotor cortex; rmGPi; rostromedial globus pallidus; internal segment; SMA; supplementary motor area; SNC; substantia nigra pars compacta; SNR; substantia nigra pars reticulata; SP; substance P; VA; ventroanterior thalamic nucleus; VAdc; ventral anterior thalamic nucleus; dencicellular subdivision; VAmc; ventral anterior thalamic nucleus; magnocellular subdivision; VApc; ventral anterior thalamic nucleus; parvicellular subdivision; VM; ventromedial thalamic nucleus; VL; ventrolateral thalamic nucleus; VAVL; ventroanterior-ventrolateral thalamic complex; VP; ventral pallidum;\n",

      "Cerebellar thalamic activity in the macaque monkey encodes the duration but not the force or velocity of wrist movement The way in which the cerebellum influences the output of the motor cortex is not known The aim of this study was to establish whether information about force velocity or duration of movement is encoded in cerebellar thalamic discharge and could therefore be involved in the modulation of motor cortical activity Extracellular single cell recordings were made from the cerebellar thalamus  neurones and VPLc  neurones of four conscious macaques performing simple wrist movements with various load and gain conditions imposed A significant correlation Spearmans P   was found between movement duration and the duration of neuronal discharge of most cerebellar thalamic neurones  the velocity of movement and rate of neuronal discharge of some cerebellar thalamic neurones  but not between force of movement and rate of neuronal discharge of any cerebellar thalamic neurones Similar relationships were found between the activity of VPLc neurones and these movement parameters The strength of the correlations increased when many cells were grouped and analysed as an ensemble suggesting that populations of cerebellar thalamic and VPLc neurones can encode a signal with higher fidelity than single neurones alone The ensemble data confirmed that the most robust association was between the duration of neuronal discharge and movement duration We propose that the cerebellum does not provide the motor cortex with specific information about movement force or velocity but rather that its major role is in activating many motor cortical regions for a specific duration thus influencing the timing of complex movements involving many muscles and joints nan\n",

      "Prefrontal cortex projections to the basilar pons in rhesus monkey: implications for the cerebellar contribution to higher function The feedforward limb of the cerebrocerebellar system is directed largely through the corticopontine pathway We determined the extent to which higher order corticopontine projections are derived from prefrontal associative cortices by injecting anterograde tracers into multiple prefrontal regions in rhesus monkeys Most prefrontopontine projections were derived from the dorsolateral and dorsomedial convexities including areas A  dorsal  and  and lighter projections arose from medial and ventrolateral cortices These findings strengthen the observation that the cerebrocerebellar system incorporates associative cerebral regions and they enhance the notion that the cerebellum participates in the organization of cognitive function Frontal lobe; Pons; Cerebellum; Connections; Anatomy; Behavior; Cognition;\n",

      "Prenatal removal of frontal association cortex in the fetal rhesus monkey: Anatomical and functional consequences in postnatal life Anatomical and behavioral consequences were examined following bilateral or unilateral resections of the presumptive dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in  rhesus monkey fetuses at E nd embryonic day E E and E with subsequent replacement in utero and delivery at later stages of development Unoperated monkeys of appropriate pre- and postnatal ages served as controls for certain features of morphogenesis and tectogenesis Monkeys given comparable unilateral or bilateral lesions at selected postnatal ages were used as controls for the behavioral effects of prenatal resection as well as for neuropathological examination The behavioral evaluation provided evidence for extraordinary preservation of function after frontal cortical resection in the prenatal period During the entire course of its postnatal development a monkey that sustained bilateral resection as a fetus at E performed surprisingly well and clearly with the competence of unoperated monkeys of identical or older ages on tasks selective for dorsolateral prefrontal cortical function it did not exhibit deficits characteristics of animals that have comparable or even smaller resections as juveniles or adults Following either unilateral or bilateral resection prior to E ectopic sulci and gyri appeared in intact regions of the frontal lobe of each hemisphere as well as in locations at a considerable distance from the lesions such as the temporal and occipital lobes The cytoarchitectonic characteristics of the cortex in these anomalous gyri were typical of adjacent cortex in the regions in which they appeared Examination of the parvocellular subdivision of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus yielded the novel finding that this principal source of essential projections to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex contained a virtually normal number of neurons in postnatal monkeys following unilateral or bilateral lesions performed at or before E and exhibited only a partial loss of neurons after surgery at E The same cells regularly degenerate following comparable resections in the postnatal period The survival of these neurons in prenatally operated monkeys is unprecedented and can be explained by several hypotheses including the possibility that their axons become rerouted to other structures in the absence of their normal targets The present results thus demonstrate that ablation of a circumscript area of the frontal cortex in a non-human primate a full two months before birth may leave the functions later to be subserved by that area unaffected Such early surgical intervention results in significant alteration in the gross mdorphological characteristics of the cortex and apparently induces a functionally compensatory reorganization of thalamocortical connections Similar principles may account for sparing of function following early damage to the human brain nan\n",

      "Chapter 29 Anatomical origins of the classical receptive field and modulatory surround field of single neurons in macaque visual cortical area V1 From the analyses of our own and others anatomical and physiological data for the macaque visual system we arrive at a conclusion that three pathways can provide the V neuron with access to information from the visual field and affect its response First direct thalamic input can determine the size of the initial activating RF at high contrast Second lateral connections can enlarge the RF at low contrast by pooling information from larger regions at cortex that are otherwise ineffective when high contrast thalamic input is driving the cortical neuron Thirdly feedback from extrastriate cortex possibly together with overlap or interdigitation of coactive lateral connectional fields within V can provide a large and stimulus specific surround modulatory field The stimulus specificity of the interactions between the center and surround fields may be due to the orderly matching structure and different scales of intra-areal and feedback projection excitatory pathways The observed activity changes of single recorded excitatory neurons could be a result of the relative weight of excitation on the excitatory neurons themselves and on local inhibitory interneurons that synapse on them Inhibitory basket neurons driven by the local excitatory neurons could govern local interactions between cortical patches of different tuning properties resulting in more distant changes in excitatory input in the laterally connected intra-areal neuronal pools nan\n",

      "Cortical Projections of Motor Thalamus A general organization principle of the thalamocortical connectivity of the sensory systems is the principle of parallel pathways According to this principle each cortical area involved in the processing of a single-sensory modality is the target of two or more subcortical pathways relaying into separate thalamic nuclei This chapter explores whether the cortical projections of motor thalamus are organized according to a similar parallel pathways principle It explains the study based on  injections of WGA-HRP and injections of fluorescent dyes in the agranular frontal cortex of macaque monkeys Most of the injections are made in electrophysiologically identified cortical sites This allows one to correlate the thalamocortical projections to the cytoarchitectonic cortical subdivision The chapter also presents the pattern of thalamic connections of each agranular frontal sector and the somatotopic organization of the motor thalamus nan\n",

The present study evaluated the occurrence distribution and number of GABAergic neurons in the thalamus of different mammalian species bat mouse rat guinea pig rabbit cat monkey humans by means of light microscopical immunoenzymatic localization of GABA or of its biosynthetic enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase and by ultrastructural immunogold detection of GABA Our data demonstrated that  GABAergic local circuit neurons were detected in the thalamic visual domain in all the species analyzed whereas in other thalamic nuclei their presence and number varied among species  the number of GABAergic local circuit neurons progressively increased in the dorsal thalamus of species with more complex behavior  the presence of local circuit neurons conferred a similar intrinsic organization to the dorsal thalamic nuclei characterized by complex synaptic arrangements  in the reticular thalamic nucleus whose neurons were GABA-immunoreactive in all the examined species the cellular density decreased from the bat to humans These findings strongly suggest that thalamic GABAergic local circuit neurons are not directly related to the ability to perform specific sensorimotor tasks but they are likely to reflect an increasing complexity of the local information processing that occurs at thalamic level Copyright   Elsevier Science Inc Immunocytochemistry; Electron microscopy; Interneurons; Reticular thalamic nucleus; Ventrobasal nucleus; Inhibitory circuits;\n",

      "Organization of the afferent connections of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus in the rat; related to the mediodorsal-prefrontal topography The aim of the present study was to determine the organization of the afferents of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus in relation to the reciprocal connections of this nucleus with different areas of the prefrontal cortex For this purpose injections of horseradish peroxidase or horseradish peroxidase conjugated to wheatgerm agglutinin were placed in different parts of the mediodorsal nucleus These experiments revealed the organization of the reciprocal mediodorsal-prefrontal connections since wheatgerm agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase is transported effectively in anterograde and retrograde directions Injections of wheatgerm agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase or fluorescent tracers were placed in different portions of the prefrontal cortex and the lectin Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin was injected in the mediodorsal nucleus in order to verify in more detail the point-to-point relationship in the mediodorsal-prefrontal connections The organization of a number of the subcortical afferents to the mediodorsal nucleus was determined in detail using injections of Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin wheatgerm agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase or tritiated amino acids in areas identified as a source of mediodorsal afferents in the retrograde tracing experiments These anterograde tracers were injected in different parts of the pallidal complex the amygdala the lateral hypothalamus the lateral entorhinal cortex the ventral mesencephalon the superior colliculus and the dorsal tegmental region The results of the present experiments indicate that the mediodorsal nucleus on the basis of its cyto-myelo- and chemoarchitecture as well as the organization of its reciprocal connections with the prefrontal cortex can be subdivided into a medial a central a lateral and a paralamellar segment Apart from this subdivision along a mediolateral axis rostrocaudal and dorsoventral differences are also evident in the structural organization and connectivity of the mediodorsal nucleus A number of subcortical structures send fibres to all parts of the mediodorsal nucleus The reticular thalamic nucleus projects to the mediodorsal nucleus in a topographical way such that its rostral part is connected with the rostral part of the nucleus whereas more caudal and ventral areas in the reticular thalamic nucleus are connected with more caudal parts of the mediodorsal nucleus Regions in the brainstem that project to all parts of the mediodorsal nucleus include the mesencephalic raphénuclei the locus coeruleus the rostral part of the central gray substance and the reticular formation The median raphénucleus projects most heavily to lateral parts of the mediodorsal nucleus whereas the dorsal raphénucleus is most strongly connected with its medial parts Besides these general inputs the different mediodorsal nuclear segments receive a specific input and have different relations with particular areas of the prefrontal cortex The rostral part of the medial segment of the nucleus is reciprocally connected mainly with the prelimbic and the ventral anterior cingulate areas and to a lesser degree with the medial orbital and the ventral agranular insular areas The posterior ventral part of the medial segment of the mediodorsal nucleus has reciprocal fibre relations with the dorsal agranular insular area The most medial part of the nucleus immediately adjacent to the paraventricular nucleus receives fibres from the infralimbic area but appears not to reciprocate them The medial segment receives input from a large number of structures in the realm of the limbic system ie the amygdala the lateral entorhinal cortex the nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca the lateral preoptic area the supramammillary nuclei and from structures that are closely related to the basal ganglia system ie the ventral pallidum the ventral tegmental area and the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra With an antibody against dopamine it was determined that both the paraventricular nucleus and the adjacent parts of the mediodorsal nucleus contain a plexus of dopaminergic fibres The most medial zone of the dorsal-medial thalamus which includes the paraventricular nucleus receives additional fibres from the nucleus accumbens the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis the dorsomedial hypothalamus the subiculum the parabrachial nuclei and the nucleus of the solitary tract The central segment of the mediodorsal nucleus differs from the medial segment in that it receives its most strong and specific input from olfactory related structures such as the deep layers of the prepiriform cortex and the ventral pallidal cells in the olfactory tubercle The central segment also receives afferents from the nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca the lateral preoptic area and the lateral hypothalamus This segment of the nucleus is reciprocally connected with the ventral agranular insular and the lateral orbital areas The lateral segment of the mediodorsal nucleus receives a small number of fibres from the medial portion of the globus pallidus and the lateral hypothalamus but its main inputs come from brainstem structures such as the substantia nigra pars reticulata the interpeduncular nucleus and the dorsolateral tegmental nucleus This segment of the nucleus is reciprocally connected mainly with the dorsal anterior cingulate area The paralamellar segment of the mediodorsal nucleus receives afferents from the deep layers of the superior colliculus the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra and the dorsolateral tegmental nucleus Additional inputs most probably come from pretectal nuclei the region of the cuneiform nucleus and the contralateral fastigial nucleus of the cerebellum This segment of the nucleus is reciprocally connected with the medial precentral area of the frontal cortex an area that in the rat constitutes the frontal eye field These results indicate that in the rat via distinct segments of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus different parts of the prefrontal cortex can be influenced by a wide spectrum of structures that are mainly involved in the limbic circuitry or are part of the limbic-afferented basal ganglia An important observation is that the mediodorsal nucleus receives strong inputs from pallidal nigral and tectal areas which are the main waystations in the outflow of the basal ganglia This may imply a

      "Functional plasticity in primate somatosensory thalamus following chronic lesion of the ventral lateral spinal cord The long-term consequences of thoracic spinothalamic tract lesion on the physiological properties of neurons in the ventral posterior lateral nucleus of the thalamus in monkeys were assessed Neurons responding to both compressive and phasic brush stimuli multireceptive neurons but not brush-specific low-threshold neurons in the partially deafferented thalamus showed increased spontaneous activity increased responses evoked by cutaneous stimuli and larger mean receptive field size than the same types of cells in the thalamus with intact innervation The spike train properties of both the spontaneous and evoked discharges of cells were also altered so that there was an increased incidence of spike-bursts in cells of deafferented thalamus These changes were widespread in the thalamus and included cells in both the fully innervated forelimb representation and the partially denervated hindlimb representation ipsilateral to the lesion The spontaneous and evoked spike trains in the ipsilateral thalamus also show increased frequency of both spike-burst and non-burst events compared to the intact thalamus These results indicate that chronic spinothalamic tract lesion produces widespread changes in the physiological properties of a discrete cell population of the thalamus The findings in this study indicate that the thalamic processing of somatosensory information conveyed by the lemniscal system is altered by transection of the spinothalamic tract This change in sensory processing in the thalamus would result in altered cortical processing of innocuous somatosensory inputs following deafferentation and so possibly contribute to the generation of the central pain syndrome central pain; monkey; spike train; deafferentation; neuropathy; CPS; central pain syndrome; IS; inter-spike interval; LT; low-threshold neurons; MR; multireceptive neurons; RF; receptive field; VPL; ventral posterior lateral nucleus; WDR; wide dynamic range neurons;\n",

      "Interspecies Comparison of Expression of GABA/Benzodiazepine Receptors and their Subunits in the Motor and Limbic Nuclei of the Thalamus This chapter presents an overview on the current knowledge on the organization of γ-aminobutyric acid GABAergic mechanisms in the thalamus based on the literature data and findings on the motor and limbic thalamic nuclei in the cat and monkey In the monkey thalamus there is a greater variety of GABAergic synapses and the internuclear differences are more pronounced compared to the thalami of rat and cat Additionally in the monkey ventro-lateral nucleus GABAergic dendro-dendritic contacts between local circuit neurons are found commonly but in the ventral anterior nucleus they are absent The chapter also explores whether there are functional differences among the various types of GABAergic synapses found in thalamic nuclei The data described in the chapter suggests that different mechanisms of modulation of GABAergic transmission can exist in the thalami of different species and if this is the case the physiological properties of otherwise similar afferent inputs can differ as well nan\n",

      "Distribution of cerebellar terminations and their relation to other afferent terminations in the ventral lateral thalamic region of the monkey The efferent projections of the deep cerebellar nuclei were studied and their fiber trajectories and thalamic termination zones described The thalamic termination zones for the dentate interposed and fastigial nuclei are identical and coincide with the cytoarchitectonically unique cell-sparse region of the ventral lateral complex This region includes nuclei VPLo VLc VLps X and extensions of these between the cell clusters of nucleus VLo The inputs from dentate and interpositus are contralateral dense and their termination patterns extend continuously throughout all nuclear components of the cell-sparse zone Interdigitation of these two inputs within the cell-sparse region is directly demonstrated The fastigial input is more restricted but bilateral Each of the deep cerebellar nuclei also projects to the central lateral nucleus of the intralaminar complex The strong interconnection of the cell-sparse zone with cortical area  is confirmed The patterns of retrogradely labeled thalamocortical cells and of anterogradely labeled corticothalamic terminations following cortical injections of horseradish peroxidase and of tritiated amino acids extend continuously through the VPLo-VLc region and its extensions but do not invade the posteriorly situated VPLc nucleus Thalamic inputs from the dorsal column nuclei terminate independently within the morphologically distinct VPLc nucleus adjacent to the cell-sparse cerebellar terminal zone The dorsal column-lemniscal terminations do not overlap the cerebellar terminations The clear segregation of the two sets of terminations is demonstrated directly using an anterograde double labeling method Spinothalamic terminations end in VPLc but extend into the cerebellar terminal zone Another ascending input from the vestibular nuclei is also shown to terminate within the cell-sparse zone Comparison with other studies implies that cerebellar pallidal and substantia nigral inputs do not converge in the monkey thalamus and that the nuclei in which they terminate project to different cortical areas The relation of these and of sensory influences ascending to motor cortex from the periphery are discussed monkey thalamus; cerebellum; motor cortex; ventral lateral region; afferent connection; AM; anteromedial nucleus; Am; ambiguus nucleus; AV; anteroventral nucleus; CL; central lateral nucleus; CM; centre médian nucleus; Co; cochlear nucleus; D; dentate nucleus; EC; external cuneate nucleus; F; fastigial nucleus; g; cell group g Brodal and Pompeiano; GL; lateral geniculate nucleus; GM; medial geniculate nucleus; ICP; inferior cerebellar peduncle; IO; inferior olivary complex; IP; interposed nucleus; LD; lateral dorsal nucleus; Li; limitans nucleus; LP; lateral posterior nucleus; mc; magnocellular medial geniculate nucleus; MD; mediodorsal nucleus; MLF; medial lonpitudinal fasciculus; NS; solitary nucleus; Pc; paracentral nucleus; PF; parafascicular nucleus; Pl; pulvinar; Pli; inferior pulvinar nucleus; Po; posterior nucleus; PpH; prepositus hypoglossi nucleus; R; reticular nucleus; Re; reuniens nucleus; RNmc; magnocellular red nucleus; RNpc; parvocellular red nucleus; SG; Sg; suprageniculate nucleus; SM; stria medullaris; THI; habenulointerpeduncular tract; VA; ventral anterior nucleus; VLc; ventral lateral nucleus; caudal division VLm ventral lateral nucleus; medial division VLo ventral lateral nucleus; oral division; VLps; ventral lateral nucleus; pars postrema Vl lateral vestibular nucleus VesD descending vestibular nucleus VMb basal ventromedial nucleus Vm; VesM medial vestibular nucleus VPI ventral posterior nucleus; inferior division VPLc ventral posterolateral nucleus; caudal division VPLo ventral posterolateral nucleus; oral division VPM ventral posteromedial nucleus X nucleus X Olszewski ZI zona incerta Vsp trigeminal complex; spinal nucleus VII facial nucleus X dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve XII hypoglossal nucleus;\n",

      "Corticostriatal and corticosubthalamic input zones from the presupplementary motor area in the macaque monkey: comparison with the input zones from the supplementary motor area The presupplementary motor area pre-SMA is a cortical motor-related area which lies in the medial wall of the frontal lobe immediately anterior to the supplementary motor area SMA This area has been considered to participate in the control of complex forelimb movements in a way different from the SMA In an attempt to analyze the patterns of projections from the pre-SMA to the basal ganglia we examined the distributions of pre-SMA inputs in the striatum and the subthalamic nucleus and compared them with the SMA input distributions To detect morphologically the terminal fields from the pre-SMA and the forelimb region of the SMA anterograde tracers were injected into such areas that had been identified electrophysiologically in the macaque monkey Corticostriatal inputs from the pre-SMA were distributed mainly in the striatal cell bridges connecting the rostral aspects of the caudate nucleus and the putamen as well as in their neighboring striatal portions These input zones were located with no substantial overlap rostral to corticostriatal input zones from the SMA forelimb region Corticosubthalamic input zones from the pre-SMA were almost localized in the medial aspect of the nucleus where corticosubthalamic inputs from the SMA forelimb region were also distributed predominantly However the major terminal fields from the pre-SMA were centered ventrally to those from the SMA The present results indicate that the corticostriatal and corticosubthalamic input zones from the pre-SMA appear to be segregated from the SMA-derived input zones This implies the possibility of parallel processing of motor information from the pre-SMA and SMA in the cortico-basal ganglia circuit Basal ganglia; Striatum; Subthalamic nucleus; Presupplementary motor area; Supplementary motor area; Motor control;\n",

      "The human cerebro-cerebellar system: its computing; cognitive; and language skills In this review of the human cerebro-cerebellar system the focus is on the possible contributions of the cerebellum to cognitive and languagefunctions The role of the cerebellum in these human functions has tended to be obscured by the traditional preoccupation with the motor functions of the cerebellum which have been widely observed in other vertebrates as well In the human brain some phylogenetically new parts evolved and enlarged in the cerebellum concomitantly with the enlargement of association areas in the cerebral cortex Anatomical evidence and behavioral evidence combine to suggest that this enlarged cerebellum contributes not only to motor function but also to some sensory cognitive linguistic and emotional aspects of behavior The anatomical evidence derives from the modularity of the cerebellum whose cortical nerve cells are organized into longitudinal micro-modules which are arrayed perpendicular to the cortical surface and parallel to each other The number of these micro-modules increased when the cerebellum enlarged which enlarged the computing capabilities of the network From principles underlying the processing of information it is known that when modules with modest processing capabilities are assembled in large numbers in parallel the resulting network can achieve remarkably powerful computing capabilities Such cerebellar computing capabilities can be utilized in the different areas of the cerebral cortex to which the cerebellum sends signals The cerebellar output connections convey signals through the thalamus to the cerebral cortex in segregated channels of communication which preserve the modularity of the cerebellum Through these channels modules in the lateral cerebellum can send signals to new cognitive and language areas of the cerebral cortex such as Brocas area in the prefrontal cortex The anatomy of the human cerebro-cerebellar system therefore suggests that the cerebellum can contribute to the learning not only of motor skills but also of some cognitive and language skills Supporting this anatomical evidence is the mounting behavioral evidence obtained both in normal brains and in clinical studies which indicates that the lateral cerebellum is indeed involved in some cognitive and language functions Cerebellum; Prefrontal cortex; Cognition; Language; Adaptive learning; Cerebro-cerebellar module;\n",

      "MRI-Based Topographic Parcellation of Human Cerebral White Matter and Nuclei We describe a system for parcellation of the human cerebral white matter and nuclei based upon magnetic resonance images An algorithm for subdivision of the cerebral central white matter according to topographic criteria is developed in the companion manuscript In the present paper we provide a rationale for this system of parcellation of the central white matter and we extend the system of cerebral parcellation to include principal subcortical gray structures such as the thalamus and the basal ganglia The volumetric measures of the subcortical gray and white matter parcellation units in  young adult brains are computed and reported here as well In addition with the comprehensive system for cerebral gray and white matter structure parcellation as reference we formulate a systematics of forebrain connectivity The degree to which functionally specific brain areas correspond to topographically specific areas is an open empirical issue The resolution of this issue requires the development of topographically specific anatomic analyses such as presented in the current system and the application of such systems to a comprehensive set of functionalanatomic correlation studies in order to establish the degree of structuralfunctional correspondence This system is expected to be applied in both cognitive and clinical neuroscience as an MRI-based topographic systematics of human forebrain anatomy with normative volumetric reference and also as a system of reference for the anatomic organization of specific neural systems as disrupted by focal lesions in lesiondeficit correlations nan\n",

      "The Thalamus The thalamus is the largest structure of the mammalian diencephalon It comprises many nuclear groups each concerned with transmitting characteristic afferent signals to specific areas of the cerebral cortex The thalamus is often described as the gateway to the cerebral cortex The term thalamus is a Greek word meaning inner chamber Its origin dates back to the nd Century AD when Galen traced the optic-nerve fibers to an oval mass closely associated with the ventricles This part of the brain known as the optic thalamus was later defined as a large mass of gray matter involved with visual stimuli and in the processing of all sensory modalities except olfaction The size of the thalamus is relatively small compared to that of the neocortex but the functions of each major neocortical areas largely depend on the interactions with a well-defined thalamic-cell group For this reason an increase in size of any neocortical areas is correlated with a corresponding increase in the related thalamic nuclei The nomenclature of the different nuclear subdivisions of the primate thalamus is more complex than in rodents Although the thalamic cytoarchitecture in monkeys and humans is relatively similar the nomenclature used to define thalamic nuclei in simians and humans has diverged so much over the years that non-specialist readers surely believe that the thalami of humans and monkeys are fundamentally different Table  The main difference between human and nonhuman primate thalami is the relative growth of specific thalamic nuclei relative to other nuclear subdivisions the pulvinar is the most representative example of a thalamic nucleus that has overgrown in the human brain These keywords were added by machine and not by the authors This process is experimental and the keywords may be updated as the learning algorithm improves Thalamic Nucleus; Lateral Geniculate Nucleus; Reticular Nucleus; Relay Neuron; Dorsal Thalamus;\n",

      "Organization of the output of the ventral striatopallidal system in the rat: Ventral pallidal efferents The efferent projections of the ventral pallidum in the rat were studied using anterograde tracing of Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin and retrograde tracing of choleratoxin subunit B The main aim of this study was to determine the degree of topographical organization in the outputs of the ventral pallidum In the telencephalon ventral pallidal fibers reach the prefrontal cortex the ventral striatum the lateral septum the basolateral lateral and central amygdaloid nuclei and the lateral entorhinal area Diencephalic targets of ventral pallidal fibers are the lateral hypothalamus the reticular nucleus of the thalamus the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus the dorsomedial part of the subthalamic nucleus the medial part of the parafascicular nucleus and the lateral habenula In the mesencephalon ventral pallidal fibers terminate in the ventral tegmental area the substantia nigra the retrorubral area the median raphe nucleus the nucleus raphe magnus the peribrachial area the ventromedial part of the central gray substance and the locus coeruleus The results of the experiments in which retrograde tracers were injected in different nuclei in the mesencephalon allow the distinction of two main areas in the ventral pallidum Deposits of retrograde tracers in the substantia nigra pars reticulata result in labeling of cells in the dorsolateral part of the ventral pallidum located immediately ventral to the anterior limb of the anterior commissure Retrograde tracer injections in other targets of the ventral mesencephalon ie the dopaminergic cell groups A A or A or nuclei in the peribrachial area result in labeling of neurons in an extensive ventromedial and ventrolateral zone of the ventral pallidum The medial part of this ventral pallidal zone projects to the ventral tegmental area whereas ventral and lateral parts connect with more lateral and caudal mesencephalic targets The projections from the ventral pallidum to the ventral striatum the subthalamic nucleus and adjacent lateral hypothalamic area and the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus are distinctly topographically organized The ventral pallidostriatal projections preserve a medial-to-lateral a dorsal-to-ventral and to a lesser degree a rostral-to-caudal topography With respect to the subthalamic region the dorsolateral part of the ventral pallidum projects to the dorsomedial part of the subthalamic nucleus whereas the ventromedial and ventrolateral parts of the ventral pallidum are topographically connected with the area of the lateral hypothalamus medially adjacent to the subthalamic nucleus The ventral pallidal projections to the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus are arranged such that dorsal-to-ventral and medial-to-lateral gradients in the ventral pallidum correspond to medial-to-lateral and rostral-to-caudal gradients in the mediodorsal nucleus respectively This topography in the ventral pallidal-mediodorsal thalamic pathways fits in with the parallel arrangement of a number of circuits that involve distinct parts of the prefrontal cortex the ventral striatum the ventral pallidum and the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus Such a parallel arrangement of the connections of the ventral parts of the basal ganglia with the prefrontal cortex and the mediodorsal thalamus is consistent with the more general concept of parallel functionally segregated basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuits CTb; cholera toxin subunit B; DAB; diaminobenzidine; EDTA; ethylenediamine tetra-acetate; PAP; peroxidase-antiperoxidase; PBS; phosphatebuffered saline; PHA-L; Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin; TBS-T; TRIS-buffered saline with Triton; TH; tyrosine hydroxylase; VP; ventral pallidum; VP; lateral part of VP; VPm; medial part of VP; VPvm; ventromedial VP; VPdl; dorsolateral VP;\n",

      "First order connections of the visual sector of the thalamic reticular nucleus in marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) The thalamic reticular nucleus TRN supplies an important inhibitory input to the dorsal thalamus Previous studies in non-primate mammals have suggested that the visual sector of the TRN has a lateral division which has connections with first-order primary sensory thalamic and cortical areas and a medial division which has connections with higher-order association thalamic and cortical areas However the question whether the primate TRN is segregated in the same manner is controversial Here we investigated the connections of the TRN in a New World primate the marmoset Callithrix jacchus The topography of labeled cells and terminals was analyzed following iontophoretic injections of tracers into the primary visual cortex V or the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus LGNd The results show that rostroventral TRN adjacent to the LGNd is primarily connected with primary visual areas while the most caudal parts of the TRN are associated with higher order visual thalamic areas A small region of the TRN near the caudal pole of the LGNd foveal representation contains connections where first lateral TRN and higher order visual areas medial TRN overlap Reciprocal connections between LGNd and TRN are topographically organized so that a series of rostrocaudal injections within the LGNd labeled cells and terminals in the TRN in a pattern shaped like rostrocaudal overlapping fish scales We propose that the dorsal areas of the TRN adjacent to the top of the LGNd represent the lower visual field connected with medial LGNd and the more ventral parts of the TRN contain a map representing the upper visual field connected with lateral LGNd Vision; Primate; Lateral geniculate nucleus; Striate cortex; Tract tracing; Thalamus;\n",

The dopamine innervation of the thalamus follows the same pattern in both species and is most dense in midline limbic nuclei, the mediodorsal and lateral posteriorassociation nuclei, and in the ventral lateral and ventral anteriormotor nuclei. This distribution suggests that thalamic dopamine has a prominent role in emotion, attention, cognition and complex somatosensory and visual processing, as well as in motor control.Most thalamic dopaminergic axons are thin and varicose and targetboth the neuropil and small blood vessels, suggesting that, besides neuronal modulation, thalamic dopamine may have a direct influence on microcirculation.

Keywords: Dopamine; Thalamus; Monkey; Human; Primate; Dopamine transporter; Parkinson; Schizophrenia; AddictionIntroduction The thalamus is made up of multiple nuclei relaying information from subcortical centers or from other cortices to the cerebral cortex (Sherman and Guillery, 2005 ), as well as the striatum, the nucleus accumbens and the amygdala ( Steriade et al., 1997 ). In addition to specific subcortical and cortical afferents, the primate thalamus receives axons containing the neuromodulators acetylcholine (Heckers et al., 1992 ), histamine ( Manning et al., 1996 ), serotonin (Morrison and Foote, 1986; Lavoie and Parent, 1991 ), and the catecholamines adrenaline ( Rico and Cavada, 1998a ), noradrenaline (Morrison and Foote, 1986; Ginsberg et al., 1993 ) and dopamine (Sánchez-González et al., 2005 ). Until recently, the existence of significant dopamine innervation in the primate thalamus has been largely ignored, probably becausedopamine innervation of the rodent thalamus is very scant(Groenewegen, 1988; Papadopoulos and Parnavelas, 1990 ). However, fragmentary data scattered through the literature endorse the presence of dopamine innervation in the primate thalamus.Postmortem biochemical studies showed the presence of dopamine in the thalamus of macaques ( Brown et al., 1979; Goldman-Rakic and Brown, 1981; Pifl et al., 1990, 1991 ) and human subjects ( Oke and Adams, 1987 ). Later, receptor binding and in situ hybridization analyses detected the presence of dopamine D2-like ( Joyce et al., 1991; Kessler et al., 1993; Hall et al., 1996; Langer et al., 1999;Rieck et al., 2004 ) and D3-like receptors ( Gurevich and Joyce, 1999 ) in several human thalamic nuclei. Positron emission tomography (PET) radioligand studies have also demonstratedthe presence of the dopamine transporter (DAT) ( Wang et al., 1995; Halldin et al., 1996; Helfenbein et al., 1999; Brownell et al., 2003 ) and of D2-like receptors ( Farde et al., 1997; Langer et al., 1999; Okubo et al., 1999; Brownell et al., 2003; Rieck et al., 2004 ) in the human and macaque thalamus. In the course of PET studies focusing on schizophrenia, D2- and D3-like radioligand binding was also found in the thalamus of control subjects ( Talvik et al., 2003; Yasuno et al., 2004 ).

The lateral route, named \"lateral grasping network\", is mainly involved in the control of the distal part of prehension, namely grasping and manipulation. The medial route, named \"reach-to-grasp network\", is involved in the control of the full deployment of prehension act, from the direction of arm movement to the shaping of the hand according to the object to be grasped. In macaque monkeys, the reach-to-grasp network (the target of this review) includes areas of the superior parietal lobule (SPL) that hosts visual and somatosensory neurons well suited to control goal-directed limb movements toward stationary as well as moving objects. After a brief summary of the neuronal functional properties of these areas, we will analyze their cortical and thalamic inputs thanks to retrograde neuronal tracers separately injected into the SPL areas V6, V6A, PEc, and PE. These areas receive visual and somatosensory information distributed in a caudorostral, visuosomatic trend, and some of them are directly connected with the dorsal premotor cortex. This review is particularly focused on the origin and type of visual information reaching the SPL, and on the functional role this information can play in guiding limb interaction with objects in structured and dynamic environments.
