In addition to specific subcortical and cortical afferents, the primate thalamus receives axons containing the neuromodulators acetylcholine (Heckers et al., 1992 ), histamine ( Manning et al., 1996 ), serotonin (Morrison and Foote, 1986; Lavoie and Parent, 1991 ), and the catecholamines adrenaline ( Rico and Cavada, 1998a ), noradrenaline (Morrison and Foote, 1986; Ginsberg et al., 1993 ) and dopamine (Sánchez-González et al., 2005 ). Until recently, the existence of significant dopamine innervation in the primate thalamus has been largely ignored, probably becausedopamine innervation of the rodent thalamus is very scant(Groenewegen, 1988; Papadopoulos and Parnavelas, 1990 ). However, fragmentary data scattered through the literature endorse the presence of dopamine innervation in the primate thalamus.Postmortem biochemical studies showed the presence of dopamine in the thalamus of macaques ( Brown et al., 1979; Goldman-Rakic and Brown, 1981; Pifl et al., 1990, 1991 ) and human subjects ( Oke and Adams, 1987 ).

The lateral route, named \"lateral grasping network\", is mainly involved in the control of the distal part of prehension, namely grasping and manipulation.

      "brain (1970) 93, 37-56. connexions of the somatic sensory cortex of the rhesus monkey in. thalamic connexions by e. g. jones and t. p. s. powell (from the department of human anatomy, oxford) introduction relatively few attempts have been made to study thalamocortical connexions with techniques for demonstrating antegrade axonal degeneration (nauta and whitlock, 1954). this omission is largely due to the inherent difficulty involved in placing stereotaxic lesions in single thalamic nuclei without directly damaging the cortex or interrupting fibres leaving other thalamic nuclei within the thalamus itself. recently, however, it has been shown that interruption of such fibres of passage can be minimized by the use of carefully orientated electrodes (glickstein et ah, 1967; wilson and cragg, 1967; jones and powell, 19696). it is necessary to make further investigations of this type for the classical method of studying thalamocortical relationsthat of retrograde cellular degeneration (le gros clark and boggon, 1935; walker, 1938)in being relatively insensitive and difficult to interpret (powell and cowan, 1967) cannot give more than a general indication of the cortical fields to which a thalamic nucleus projects. in the cat the ventroposterior nucleus sends fibres to the first (si) and second (sli) somatic sensory areas of the cortex but to no others (jones and powell, 19696). this study has now been extended to the monkey because it is not known whether the ventroposterior nucleus of the monkey projects to sli and also because there is some evidence that the architectonic (and functional) subdivisions of si, areas 3, 1 and 2, receive differential connexions from the thalamus (le gros clark and powell, 1953; roberts and akert, 1963). differential projections to areas 3, 1 and 2 were not apparent in the cat but it is possible that species differences exist. another aspect of the present study concerns the reciprocal, corticothalamic, pathway. this has been extensively studied in the cat (auer, 1956; niimi et ah, 1963; kusama, otani and kawana, 1966; rinvik, 1968a, b; jones and powell, 1968), and it has been shown that both si and sli send fibres to the ventroposterior nucleus and to the posterior group of thalamic nuclei. the latter region and its connexions are becoming increasingly well known in the cat (rose and by guest on may 11, 2016 http://brain.oxfordjournals.org/ downloaded from 38 e. g. jones and t. p. s. powell woolsey, 1958; poggio and mountcastle, 1960; moore and goldberg, 1963; rinvik, 1968a, b; jones and powell, 1968; diamond, jones and powell, 1969), but the only information pertaining to it in the monkey is a brief report, based on ascending axonal degeneration, by mehler (1966). it was hoped, therefore, that the simian homologue of the posterior group might be defined on the basis of its corticothalamic connexions. material and methods the material upon which this study is based consists of the brains of 25 rhesus monkeys. these may be divided into two groups: (a) in six experiments electrolytic lesions were placed in the ventroposterior nucleus of the thalamus by means of an approximately\n",

      "thalamocortical connections of the parabelt auditory cortex in macaque monkeys t.a. hackett, i. stepniewska, and j.h. kaas* department of psychology, vanderbilt university, nashville, tennessee, 37240 abstract the auditory cortex of macaque monkeys contains a core of primary-like areas surrounded by a narrow belt of associated fields that encompass much of the superior temporal plane in these animals. adjacent to the lateral belt on the superior temporal gyrus is a parabelt region that contains at least two subdivisions (rostral and caudal). in a previous study (hackett et al. [1998] j. comp. neurol. 394:475495), we determined that the parabelt has topographic connections with the belt areas surrounding the core, but minimal connections with the core itself. in this study, we describe the thalamocortical connections of the parabelt auditory cortex based on multiple injections of neuronal tracers into this region in each of five macaque monkeys. injections confined to the parabelt labeled large numbers of neurons in the dorsal (mgd) and magnocellular (mgm) divisions of the medial geniculate complex (mgc), suprageniculate (sg), limitans (lim), and medial pulvinar (pm) nuclei. only when injections encroached on the lateral belt cortex were substantial numbers of labeled neurons found in the ventral (mgv) division of the mgc, consistent with the absence of significant connections between the parabelt and core fields. the rostrocaudal topography of the parabelt region was maintained in the thalamocortical connections, supporting the parcellation of this region of cortex. the results suggest that the parabelt region represents a third level of auditory cortical processing, which is not influenced by direct inputs from primary cortical or subcortical auditory structures. j. comp. neurol. 400:271286, 1998. r 1998 wiley-liss, inc. indexing terms: association cortex; thalamus; medial geniculate; pulvinar our studies of auditory cortex in monkeys, in conjunction with those from other laboratories, have led us to propose three levels of auditory processing in the temporal lobe (hackett et al., 1998; kaas and hackett, 1998). at the first level, three tonotopically organized fields make up an auditory core. these fields include the traditional primary field, ai, a more rostral or rostrolateral field, r, and a rostrotemporal field, rt. each of these fields receives auditory information from several nuclei of the medial geniculate complex and distributes in an extremely local manner to a narrow surrounding belt of approximately seven auditory areas, at least some of which also receive parallel inputs from the medial geniculate complex. all belt areas project in turn to a wide adjoining band of cortex in the superior temporal gyrus that we have termed the parabelt. whereas the parabelt may have functional subdivisions, for the present purposes, it is characterized as a continuous zone of temporal cortex with inputs from the belt, but not from the core. the question we address here is: what are the thalamic inputs to the parabelt? although this question can be answered in part by referring to the results of previous studies of temporal lobe connections (e.g., mesulam and pandya, 1973; trojanowski and jacobson, 1975; burton and jones, 1976; de vito and\n",

      "an autoradiographic study of the projections of the pretectum in the rhesus monkey (macaca mulatta): evidence for sensorimotor links to the thalamus and oculomotor nuclei. l.a. benevento michael rezak r. santos-anderson college of medicine, university of illinois medical center, chicago, ill. 60680 u.s.a. autoradiographic tracing methods were used to determine the differential projections of the pretectal nuclei, in the rhesus monkey, in relation to their inputs. the sublentiform (sl) and olivary (on) nuclei receive projections from the visual cortex, superior colliculus (sc) and an equal bilateral projection from the retina. the nucleus of the posterior commissure (npc) and its subdivisions do not receive any of these inputs. the projections of the pretectum involve a number of structures within the thalamus and brain stem and there are differences in the projection targets of the pretectal region which receives direct visual input (i.e., sl and on) and the region which does not (i.e., nucleus of the posterior commissure, npc). for example, while all pretectal regions project within the pretectum and to the sc, accessory oculomotor nuclei, reticular formation, intralaminar nuclei and hypothalamus, it is only the retino-recipient zone which projects to rostral regions such as the visceral oculomotor nuclei, the lateral pulvinar, the border between the lateral pulvinar and medial pulvinar, the oral pulvinar as well as to the thalamic reticular nucleus, ventral lateral geniculate nucleus, zona incerta and other structures. it is concluded that the retina, sc and cortex which influence the visceral oculomotor nuclei can only do so by virtue of their projections to the pretectum, and that any consideration of accommodative and pupillary reflexes must view the pretectum as an obligatory link through which various structures can influence the intrinsic musculature of the eye. in contrast to the sc, the pretectum does not project to any of the visual relay nuclei of the thalamus, such as the inferior pulvinar, which project to the visual cortices. instead, the pretectum projects directly to visuomotor, visceromotor and arousal systems. references 1 apter j.t. the significance of the unilateral argyll robertson pupil. part i, a report of 13 cases j. ophthal. 38 1954 34 43 2 aronson l.r. papez j.w. the thalamic nuclei of pithecus (macacus) rhesus ii. dorsal thalamus arch. neurol. psychiat.

(1987) report cells that change their activity during a delay depending on which of two movements the monkey is instructed to make.\n",

      "behavioral/systems/cognitive the primate thalamus is a key target for brain dopamine miguel angel sanchez-gonzalez, miguel angel garca-cabezas, beatriz rico, and carmen cavada departamento de anatoma, histologa y neurociencia, facultad de medicina, universidad autonoma de madrid, 28029 madrid, spain the thalamus relays information to the cerebral cortex from subcortical centers or other cortices; in addition, it projects to the striatum and amygdala. the thalamic relay function is subject to modulation, so the flow of information to the target regions may change depending on behavioral demands. modulation of thalamic relay by dopamine is not currently acknowledged, perhaps because dopamine innervation is reportedly scant inthe rodentthalamus. we showthat dopaminergic axons profuselytargetthe human and macaque monkey thalamus using immunolabeling with three markers of the dopaminergic phenotype (tyrosine hydroxylase, dopamine, and the dopamine transporter). the dopamine innervation is especially prominent in specific association, limbic, and motor thalamic nuclei, where the densities of dopaminergic axons are as high as or higher than in the cortical area with the densest dopamine innervation. we also identified the dopaminergic neurons projecting to the macaque thalamus using retrograde tract-tracing combined with immunohistochemistry. the origin of thalamic dopamine is multiple, and thus more complex, than in any other dopaminergic system defined to date: dopaminergic neurons of the hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray matter, ventral mesencephalon, and the lateral parabrachial nucleus project bilaterally to the monkey thalamus. we propose a novel dopaminergic system that targets the primate thalamus and is independent from the previously defined nigrostriatal, mesocortical, and mesolimbic dopaminergic systems. investigating this thalamic dopaminergic system should further our understanding of higher brain functions and conditions such as parkinsons disease, schizophrenia, and drug addiction. key words: dopamine; dopamine transporter; dopaminergic systems; thalamus; human; monkey introduction the thalamus transfers sensory information from the periphery to the cortex through first-order relay nuclei. in addition, it is a nodal point in corticocortical communication through higherorder relay or association nuclei (sherman and guillery, 1996). these functions are subject to extensive modulation, and thus the transfer of information through the thalamus depends on the state of wakefulness of the subject and on attentional or behavioral demands (mccormick, 1992; sherman and guillery, 1996; steriade et al., 1997; guillery and sherman, 2002). in fact, the vast majority of synapses in the thalamus are from modulatory afferents. the other main targets of thalamic efferents are the striatum, the nucleus accumbens, and the amygdala (steriade et al., 1997). dopamine is an important transmitter molecule in the brain. by modulating neuronal excitability and synaptic plasticity (nicola et al., 2000; bissiere et al., 2003), dopamine is essential for motor control (agid, 1991), working memory (brozoski et al., 1979), sensorimotor learning (aosaki et al., 1994), and rewardrelated learning and motivation (schultz, 2002). these functions depend on the dopamine innervation of the striatum, cerebral cortex, nucleus accumbens, and amygdala. this innervation originates in dopaminergic neurons of the ventral mesencephalon and makes up the nigrostriatal, mesocortical, and mesolimbic dopaminergic systems (lewis and sesack, 1997). the presence of dopamine in the thalamus of primates was reported a long time\n",

      "the termination of ascending tracts in the thalamus of the macaque monkey by w. e. le gros clark department of human anatomy, oxford it is well known that a large part of the elaborate cerebral cortex of the mammalian brain is concerned with the reception and interpretation of sensory impulses which are relayed to it by the thalamus. the progressive evolution of this cortical structure has formed the main theme of many classical studies by sir grafton elliot smith, and so far back as the beginning of this century(8) he designated it by the term \"neopallium\", a term which has now passed into the common language of neurologists. in his arris and gale lectures in 1910(9), sir grafton' summarized the implications of his earlier researches, and showed how the original mapping out of the neopallium into different morphological and functional areas was determined primarily by the topographical arrangement of the various thalamic nuclei which gave rise to cortical projection fibres. the present problem forms part of a general enquiry into the relation of the thalamus to the cortex in the primates. in some recent papers(4, 5, 18) the precise arrangement of various thalamo-cortical projection systems has been studied in the macaque monkey by defining the cell atrophy in the thalamic nuclei which follows local cortical ablations. it has now become necessary to determine the source of the afferent fibres which reach these nuclear elements from lower functional levels, with the object of analysing the nature of the impulses which are relayed by them to the neopallial cortex. in the present study, attention has been directed to the precise locus of termination of various ascending tracts from the spinal cord and the brain stem in regard to different nuclei of the thalamus. this question has been partially discussed in the case of lower mammals by probst(13), wallenberg (19, 20), cajal(2), ranson & ingram(14), etc., and to a limited extent in the monkey by vogt (15). in making use of the marchi method for the study of this problem it may be mentioned that the limitations of this technique are fully realized. nevertheless it is desirable to ascertain what information it can provide even if some of the conclusions to which it leads may require to be corroborated by other experimental methods. 1 the stimulus provided by this eminent anatomist in his work as an original investigator, as a teacher, and as an exponent of the problems of primate evolution, has been justly recognized as a potent factor in the development of neurological anatomy in this country. it would be difficult for the present writer to express how much he owes to this stimulus-it is sufficient to say that he derived the original inspiration for his enquiries into anatomical problems from the lectures and writings of sir grafton elliot smith, and that he feels it to be a signal honour to contribute to this dedication volume of the journal of anatomy. w. e. le cros clark material and methods the ordinary macaque\n",

(71) have further demonstrated that such monkeys can discriminate between objects on the basis of brightness. under appropriate conditions, they are also able to distinguish between a circle and a triangle, and between red and green (schilder et al., 72). cortically blind human subjects are also capable of residual visual functions as originally indicated by riddoch in 1917, when he described how patients with cortical lesions could detect moving objects in their hemianopic fields. that this residual movement detection may depend in part on the parastriate cortex is suggested by 1 the research was supported by a grant of the medical research council of canada. 2 present address:\n",

      "retrograde analyses of spinothalamic projections in the macaque monkey: input to posterolateral thalamus a.d. (bud) craig* and en-tan zhang atkinson research laboratory, barrow neurological institute, phoenix, arizona 85013 abstract the distribution of retrogradely labeled spinothalamic tract (stt) neurons was analyzed in macaque monkeys following variously sized, physiologically guided pressure or iontophoretic injections of cholera toxin subunit b (ctb) in order to determine whether different stt termination sites receive input selectively from different sets of stt cells. this report focuses on posterolateral thalamus, where prior anterograde tracing observations identified the posterior part of the ventromedial nucleus (vmpo) as the major projection target of lamina i stt neurons. large injections in posterolateral thalamus labeled predominantly stt cells in lamina i throughout the spinal cord. in cases with medium-sized or small injections centered in vmpo, almost all labeled stt cells (\u000190%) were lamina i neurons. small injections revealed a posteroanterior (foot to hand) somatotopographic organization consistent with that observed in prior anterograde tracing work; injections in posterior vmpo labeled primarily lumbosacral lamina i cells, whereas injections placed more anteriorly in vmpo labeled primarily cervical lamina i cells. these findings support the concept that vmpo is a primate lamina i spinothalamocortical relay nucleus important for pain, temperature, itch, muscle ache, sensual touch, and other interoceptive feelings from the body, and they provide strong evidence for the general hypothesis that the stt consists of several functionally and anatomically differentiable components. j. comp. neurol. 499:953964, 2006. 2006 wiley-liss, inc. indexing terms: pain; nociception; thermoreception; spinothalamic; interoception the spinothalamic tract (stt) is a major ascending pathway in primates and humans that is classically associated with pain and temperature sensations. our knowledge of the functional anatomy of the primate stt is very incomplete. prior studies in rat, cat, monkey, and human using bulk tracing methods indicated that the stt distributes projections to several thalamic nuclei that each have different anatomical and functional associations and, conversely, that the stt originates in several different cell groups that each have different anatomical and functional characteristics (le gros clark, 1936; mehler et al., 1960; boivie, 1979; willis et al., 1979; burton and craig, 1983; mantyh, 1983; albe-fessard et al., 1985; apkarian and hodge, 1989; craig et al., 1989). these observations clearly suggest the hypothesis that the stt comprises several distinct components that each convey ascending activity selectively associated with different spinal functions (craig et al., 1989; stepniewska et al., 2003; truitt et al., 2003; klop et al., 2005a). however, direct evidence addressing the hypothesis that the stt consists of distinct components has been lacking, and thus some investigators assert that all stt neurons have a direct role in pain processing (e.g., willis and westlund 1997; but cf. menetrey et al., 1984), and others assert that stt projections do not have a direct role in motor function (e.g., jones, 1985; greenan and strick, 1986; but cf. stepniewska et al., 2003). in particular, anterograde labeling studies are needed that distinguish the projections from each of the different stt cell groups of origin, and retrograde\n",

[note that in the rodent, the temporal (ventral) hippocampus is homologous with the primate anterior hippocampus, while the septal (dorsal) hippocampus is homologous with the primate posterior hippocampus (strange et al., 2014)]. a further distinction also exists between the proximal and distal portion of each hippocampal subarea. the presence of specific intrinsic and extrinsic connection patterns that reflect their proximaldistal locations (naber et al., 2000; witter, 2006; van strien et al., 2009) provides new perspectives on how hippocampal\n",

(1978) 178: 386-410. technique of labelling by retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase (hrp). our approach differs from that used in prior studies of somatosensory thalamocortical connections in the macaque monkey in that the cortical injection sites were selected on the basis of the functional characteristics exhibited by their constituent neurons (determined with the techniques of single unit analysis), rather than solely on the basis of anatomical (cytoarchitectural) criteria. the data, when considered along with those obtained in a recent neurophysiological study of vp (loe et al., '771, suggest (i1 that each functionally distinguishable zone within the cortical strip representing a given body region in s-i receives its thalamic input from a dif: ferent sector of the three-dimensional lamella\n",

(1) zones of cells in vp projecting to a given location in either area 3b or 1 also receive reciprocal projections from the cortical target. (2) a given cortical location typically relates to a disc-shaped or lamellar region in vp with the disc extending rostrocaudally and dorsoventrally, being most narrow in the mediolateral dimension. (3) the representations of the same body surface in area 1 and area 3b relate to the same region of vp. however, since fewer cells were generally labeled after area 1 injections, less dense terminations are suggested from vp to area 1 than to area 3b. (4) vp is the major or exclusive relay of somatosensory information to the two cutaneous representations from the thalamus. labeled neurons or zones of terminations were found outside vp in other parts of the somatosensory thalamus only when injection sites extended into cortex outside areas 3b and 1. (5) the face, hand, limbs, and foot are represented in a mediolateral sequence of subnuclei within vp. a dorsal capping subnucleus is apparently largely devoted to the axial trunk and perhaps other hairy skin surfaces such as some parts of the proximal surfaces of the limbs. (6) while anterior and posterior surfaces of the hind limb are widely separated by the glabrous foot in the cortical representations, they appear to be represented in adjacent zones in the thalamus. important aspects of the projection pattern of the ventroposterior nucleus of the thalamus to somatosensory cortex in monkeys were revealed by early retrograde degeneration studies. the studies of le gros clark (37) and walker (38), for example, defined the general topological organization of the projections. these investigators found that medial to lateral sectors of the postcentral gyrus receive input from lateral to medial laminar groups of cells in the ventroposterior nucleus. the laminar zone of degeneration in the thalamus resulting from a lesion restricted to a\n",

(canada) (received 23 october 1992; revised version received 3 february 1993; accepted 4 february 1993) key words: reticular thalamic nucleus; dorsal thalamus; contralateral projection this study demonstrates, using the retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase conjugated to the lectin wheat germ-agglutinin (wga-hrp), that the reticular thalamic nucleus (re) projects to the contralateral dorsal thalamus in macaque monkeys. retrogradely labeled neurons were found in the re nucleus following wga-hrp injections confined to the contralateral dorsal thalamus. in light of the currently hypothesized role of the re nucleus in the genesis of spindling rhythmicity during eeg-synchronized sleep, this finding suggests that the re nucleus contributes to the bilateral synchrony of spindle waves through its contralateral dorsal thalamic projection. until recently, little attention has been devoted to in- vestigate the connections between the thalami of both hemisphere. in fact, the conventional view is that al- though the reticular thalamic nucleus (re) and ipsi- lateral dorsal thalamic nuclei are linked reciprocally, in- terthalamic connections are rare or non-existent. how- ever, contralateral projections of the re nucleus to some dorsal thalamic nuclei have been reported in several spe- cies [1, 3, 4]. in the present study, we demonstrate that re projections to the contralateral dorsal thalamus also exist in macaque monkeys using the retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase conjugated to the lectin wheat germ-agglutinin (wga-hrp). six 0.005/11wga-hrp injections (sigma; 10% in 0.01 m phosphate buffer, ph 7.4) were performed with a 0.5 pl microsyringe in two ketamine-anesthetized macaca sylvana (ketaset, 40 mg/kg, im). because no stereotaxic atlas exists for this species, coordinates were extrapo- lated from an atlas of the rhesus monkey [5]. at the end of the injections, we allowed a period of 15-25 min be- fore retracting the needle from the thalamus in order to avoid wga-hrp diffusion along needle trajectories. after a 48 h survival time, the animals were perfused under barbiturate anesthesia (somnotol, 40 mg/kg, ip) with 500 ml of a 0.9% saline solution followed by a liter of fixative (1.25% glutaraldehyde and 1% paraformalde- correspondence: d. par& laboratoire de neurophysiologie, d6parte- ment de physiologie, facuit6 de m6decine, universit6 laval, qu6bec, que., canada g1k 7p4. fax: (1)(418) 656-7898. hyde in 0.1 m phosphate buffer, ph 7.4) and finally by a liter of phosphate buffer containing 10% sucrose at 4c. the brains were sectioned on a freezing microtome at 40 pm in the frontal plane. the selected sections were proc- essed according to the tetramethylbenzidine (tmb) pro- cedure (2] and counterstained with neutral red. in the first monkey, the injection site involved most of the lateral posterior (lp) thalamic nuclei, the rostral part of the pulvinar (pul) as well as the caudal part of the ventral posterior(vp), ventral lateral (vl), centre m6dian, central lateral (cl), and mediodorsal (md) tha- lamic nuclei (fig. 1). in the second monkey, the injection site was centered on the lateral\n",

      "localization of taste in the thalamus of macaca mulatta* marvin blum, a. earl walker, and theodore c. ruch traditionally the cortical representation of taste is described as overlapping or adjacent to the cortical olfactory area. bornstein2 points out that present teaching with regard to the gustatory system is based not so much on an extensive and reliable body of experiment as upon the inference of an intimate anatomical as well as functional relation between taste and smell. the plausibility of this inference, together with the phenomenon of uncinate fits, has led the majority of writers to neglect scattered clinical and experimental observations to the contrary, and to locate the cortical taste area in the region of the uncus and hippocampal formation. on the basis of theoretical considerations as well as observations on man and monkeys, bornstein2 has proposed a parietal opercular localization of taste: namely, that the taste representation occupies the foot of the postcentral gyrus, a region corresponding to brodmann's area 43 in the human brain. the purpose of the present experiments is to demarcate the thalamic nuclei which relay taste impulses to the cerebral cortex. the locus of this relay and even the fact of the relay is an open question. enough is known of the topographic organization of thalamocortical projection systems so that a demarcation of the thalamic nuclei for taste should bear upon the problem of cortical localization of taste. conversely, bornstein's hypothesis provides a definite point of attack, and makes unnecessary a random exploration of the thalamus which would 'be dictated by a purely empirical approach. it was predicted that discrete lesions placed in the thalamus of the monkey in the region of the nuclei which relay somatic sensation from the tongue would produce impairment of the sense of taste. according to the work of walker\"2 and of le gros clark6 the arcuate nucleus projects * from the laboratory of physiology, yale university school of medicine, and the division of neurology and neurosurgery of the university of chicago. aided by a grant from the knight fund, yale university school of medicine. this paper is a part of a dissertation presented to the faculty of the yale university school of medicine in candidacy for the degree of doctor of medicine, may 1941 by dr. bluin, who was awarded the keese thesis prize. the histological work was done by dr. a. e. walker. yale journal of biology and medicine to the face area at the lower end of the somatosensory cortex, and it has been this nucleus that we have sought to destroy. methods lesions calculated to destroy the arcuate nucleus of the thalamus (n. ventralis posteromedialis) were made with the horsley-clarke stereotaxic instrument according to coordinates given by atlas and ingram.' the lesions were always bilateral, since the two halves of the tongue could not be separately tested. the threshold for taste was quantitatively determined before operation in all cases. of the available methods for testing sensation in animals the \"preference method\" was considered best suited\n",

      "the orbitofrontal cortex (ofc) is a heterogeneous prefrontal sector selectively connected with a wide constellation of other prefrontal, limbic, sensory and premotor areas. among the limbic cortical connections, the ones with the hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex are particularly salient. sensory cortices connected with the ofc include areas involved in olfactory, gustatory, somatosensory, auditory and visual processing. subcortical structures with prominent ofc connections include the amygdala, numerous thalamic nuclei, the striatum, hypothalamus, periaqueductal gray matter, and biochemically specific cell groups in the basal forebrain and brainstem. architectonic and connectional evidence supports parcellation of the ofc. the rostrally placed isocortical sector is mainly connected with isocortical areas, including sensory areas of the auditory, somatic and visual modalities, whereas the caudal non-isocortical sector is principally connected with non-isocortical areas, and, in the sensory domain, with olfactory and gustatory areas. the connections of the isocortical and non-isocortical orbital sectors with the amygdala, thalamus, striatum, hypothalamus and periaqueductal gray matter are also specific. the medial sector of the ofc is selectively connected with the hippocampus, posterior parahippocampal cortex, posterior cingulate and retrosplenial areas, and area prostriata, while the lateral orbitofrontal sector is the most heavily connected with sensory areas of the gustatory, somatic and visual modalities, with premotor regions, and with the amygdala. the orbital sector of the primate frontal lobe, or orbitofrontal cortex (ofc), forms the base of the lobe that leans on the upper wall of the orbit. perhaps in part because of this relatively unapproachable location it has been notably less explored than other prefrontal sectors, notably the lateral prefrontal cortex. recent work in humans and in non-human primates has highlighted the functional importance of the ofc in affective and motivational behavior, prompting an unprecedented interest in this prefrontal sector (dias et al., 1996; nakamura et al., 1998; tremblay and schultz, 1999). lesions of the ofc in humans are accompanied by disorders in personality, mood and social behavior (eslinger and damasio, 1985; stuss and benson, 1986; fuster, 1989; malloy et al., 1993). recently, abnormal neuronal and glial cytoarchitecture in orbitofrontal areas, as well as in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, has been detected in the brains of patients suffering from major depression (rajkowska et al., 1999). as knowledge of the connectional links of the ofc is necessary to advance our understanding of its participation in brain function and dysfunction, we review its major afferent and efferent connections with the cortex and with subcortical structures. this review is based on our own work (cavada and reinoso-surez, 1989, 1990; cavada et al., 1991, 1992; compay et al., 1993; cruz-rizzolo et al., 1993; cavada, 1995, 1998) and on data from literature concerning the brains of adult macaque monkeys. the authoritative contributions by h. barbas, r.j. morecraft and j.l. price, and their colleagues, over the last decade deserve special mention (barbas, 1988; barbas and pandya, 1989; barbas and de olmos, 1990; barbas et al., 1991; morecraft et al., 1992; barbas, 1993; morecraft and van hoesen, 1993, 1998; ray and price, 1993; carmichael et al., 1994; carmichael and\n",

(j. comp. neurol. 1990;298:000-000). the main observations were (1) all thalamocortical projections to the sensorimotor cortex of the mature macaque are well established by embryonic days 146-150, as was shown by labeling these pathways in infants delivered by cesarian section, (2) a significant number of thalamocortical neurons in the newborn were double-labeled following dye injections into different pre- or postcentral areas, and where the margins of the dye uptake zones were separated by 3-8 mm, and (3) extensive projections from the anterior pulvinar nucleus to the motor and premotor cortex, and to the supplementary motor cortex were labeled in the newborn macaque. both the exuberant terminal arborizations, and the precentral pulvinar projections were diminished by the 6th postnatal month, and absent in the mature macaque. the role of epigenetic determinants of these postnatal events is briefly considered. key words: postnatal development, fluorescent dye axon tracers, thalamocortical projections, primate the infant monkey's increasing sensorimotor coordination in the postnatal months, evident in the use of the hands, is a complex process. not only is the animal's interaction with the surrounding world progressively more purposeful, but movements become more precise, and there is an increasing economy with the exploration and handling of nearby objects to gain knowledge of their location, size, shape, and surface texture. while there is no doubt that this improving sensorimotor behavior is an expression of postnatal changes occurring in the structural and functional organization of some or all of the many pathways and neuron populations that mediate it, identifying these relevant changes is not simple. substantial postnatal morphological changes within the sensorimotor cortex and its connections have long been recognized (jones, '81, for review). within the primate sensorimotor cortex, dendritic differentiation (conel, '39; jones, '81), the transient overproduction of synapses (huttenlocher et al., '82; rakic et al., '86), and the selective redistribution of callosal axonal terminals (killackey and chalupa, '86) are some of the changes that have been observed in the postnatal period. in this same period corticospinal neurons develop appropriate synaptic connections with spinal motoneurons, many of which have no such input at birth (kuypers, '62, '81). killackey and chalupa's ('86) analysis of the ontogeny of callosal connections of the macaque's sensorimotor cortex illustrate some of the developmental features which it shares with the more extensively studied visual cortex\n",

(bud) craig atkinson research laboratory, barrow neurological institute, phoenix, arizona 85013 abstract the organization of cerebellothalamic projections was investigated in macaque monkeys using injections of retrograde tracers (cholera toxin b and fluorescent dextrans) in the posteroventral part of the ventrolateral thalamic nucleus (vlpv), the main source of thalamic inputs to the primary motor cortex. injections that filled all of vlpv labeled abundant neurons that were inhomogeneously distributed among many unlabeled cells in the deep cerebellar nuclei (dcbn). single large pressure injections made in face-, forelimb-, or hindlimb-related portions of vlpv using physiological guidance labeled numerous neurons that were broadly dispersed within a coarse somatotopographic anteroposterior (foot to face) gradient in the dentate and interposed nuclei. small iontophoretic injections labeled fewer neurons with the same somatotopographic gradient, but strikingly, the labeled neurons in these cases were as broadly dispersed as in cases with large injections. simultaneous injections of multiple tracers in vlpv (one tracer per somatic region with no overlap between injections) confirmed the general somatotopography but also demonstrated clearly the overlapping distributions and the close intermingling of neurons labeled with different tracers. significantly, very few neurons (\u00012%) were double-labeled. this organizational pattern contrasts with the concept of a segregated point-to-point somatotopy and instead resembles the complex patterns that have been observed throughout the motor pathway. these data support the idea that muscle synergies are represented anatomically in the dcbn by a general somatotopography in which intermingled neurons and dispersed but selective connections provide the basis for plastic, adaptable movement coordination of different parts of the body. j. comp. neurol. 508:286314, 2008. 2008 wiley-liss, inc. indexing terms: indexing terms: motor thalamus; cerebellum; motor synergies; motor learning; asynergia the cerebellothalamic tract (ctt) connects the deep cerebellar nuclei (dcbn) to several thalamic nuclei, particularly the posterior ventral part of the ventral lateral nucleus (vlpv; as defined by morel et al., 2005), which is the main source of thalamic input to the primary motor cortex (m1). the ctt projections play a crucial role in fine spatial and temporal tuning of coordinated movements. they also play a key role in the learning and retention of new motor skills. despite their importance in motor control and learning in primates, the organization of cerebellothalamic projections to vlpv remains largely unexplored. early anterograde tracing studies using autoradiographic or degeneration methods indicated that ctt projections have a basic topographic organization (chanpalay, 1977; thach and jones, 1979; stanton, 1980; kalil, 1981; asanuma et al., 1983a; jones, 1983). in those studies, injections of tritiated amino acids or lesions placed in the anterior portion of the dcbn produced labeling in the lateral portion of vlpv, whereas injections further posterior labeled more medial portions of vlpv. this pattern seemed to match the topography of thalamocortical projections from vlpv to m1 (strick, 1976a,b) and the early model of body representation in m1 (woolsey et al., 1952). grant sponsor: barrow\n",

(steriade et al., 1987, 1993; steriade and llinas, 1988). an aberration of this thalamocortical pathway has been implicated in the generation of absence epilepsy. calcium-dependent oscillatory properties of the nrt are critical for the expression of spike and wave discharges (avanzini et al., 1992, 1993) and a selective increase in ca++ t-channel currents has been reported in the nrt of\n",

      "abstract the motor thalamic areas receiving input from the globus pallidus (va) and the cerebellar nuclei (vl) appear to have different roles in the generation and guidance of movements. in order to further test these differences, we used electrical stimulation to map the ventro-anterior and ventro-lateral nuclei of the thalamus in three ketamine anaesthetised monkeys. movements were readily evoked from vl at currents of down to 10 a. the movements were typically multijoint, and stimulation could evoke arm and trunk or arm and facial movement at the same current threshold. evoked arm movements often involved multiple joints, with or without finger movements. facial movements included the lips, tongue, jaw, eyebrows and, occasionally, the eyes. the thalamic map was topographic, but complex with at least two separate regions related to arm movement. very few sites within the va could stimulate movement, even at high currents. we therefore suggest that the cerebellar projections to motor regions of the cortex, which pass through the vl thalamic nuclei, have a different relationship and are closer to movement execution than the projections from basal ganglia via the ventro-anterior nucleus. key words thalamus basal ganglia cerebellum electrical stimulation movement introduction the basal ganglia and cerebellum appear to have different roles in the generation and guidance of movements (a recent collection of papers are provided by mano et al. 1993). these two structures project to separate zones within the motor territories of the thalamus, which in turn project to overlapping regions within the motor cortical areas. one strand of evidence supporting this separation of function is the differential effects of electrical stimulation within the motor thalamus. in general, microstimulation within pallidal-receiving areas has been shown less likely to evoke motor responses, whereas in the cerebellar-receiving areas, movements can be evoked at low current thresholds. however, there are still some aspects of this microstimulation work that require clarification. unfortunately, the nomenclature of the motor thalamus is confusing, with at least three different schemes (olszewski 1952; jones 1985; ilinsky and kultas-ilinksy 1987). in this paper we will use ilinsky and kultasilinksys (1987) scheme. they defined pallidal-receiving nuclei as lying within va, (vapc, vadc and vamc), while the cerebellar-receiving nuclei were grouped together as vl. their definition of vamc and vapc were synonymous with olszewskis (1952), but what they defined as vadc, olszewski had labelled as vlo. olszewski defined the cerebellar-receiving nuclei as vplo, vlps, vlc and area x. thus, we can abbreviate the pallidalreceiving nuclei to va and the cerebellar nuclei to vl, and we will refer to vlo only as vadc; we will occasionally refer to subdivisions within vl (vplo, vlps, vlc or area x). strick (1976) first recorded and stimulated within the arm area of the motor thalamus and reported that localised contractions of shoulder, arm and hand musculature could be seen at currents of 25 a at about 30% of the sites tested, mainly within vl (vlc and vplo), although some sites fell within vadc (olszewskis vlo). strick did not report on the somatotopic details, but\n",
