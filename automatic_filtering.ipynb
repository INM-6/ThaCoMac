    "# text = 'Vision for action: thalamic and cortical inputs to the macaque superior tract neural tracing, parietal lobule The dorsal visual stream, the cortical circuit that in the primate brain is mainly dedicated to the visual control of actions, is split into two routes, a lateral and a medial one, both involved in coding different aspects of sensorimotor control of actions. The lateral route, named \"lateral grasping network\", is mainly involved in the control of the distal part of prehension, namely grasping and manipulation. The medial route, named \"reach-to-grasp network\", is involved in the control of the full deployment of prehension act, from the direction of arm movement to the shaping of the hand according to the object to be grasped. In macaque monkeys, the reach-to-grasp network (the target of this review) includes areas of the superior parietal lobule (SPL) that hosts visual and somatosensory neurons well suited to control goal-directed limb movements toward stationary as well as moving objects. After a brief summary of the neuronal functional properties of these areas, we will analyze their cortical and thalamic inputs thanks to retrograde neuronal tracers separately injected into the SPL areas V6, V6A, PEc, and PE. These areas receive visual and somatosensory information distributed in a caudorostral, visuosomatic trend, and some of them are directly connected with the dorsal premotor cortex. This review is particularly focused on the origin and type of visual information reaching the SPL, and on the functional role this information can play in guiding limb interaction with objects in structured and dynamic environments. Area PEc; Area V6; Area V6A; Dorsal visual stream; Goal-directed arm movement; Sensorimotor integration.'\n",

When using a stereotaxic instrument for visual field stimulation we found that electrode placements in the thalamus and mesencephalon of prone rhesus monkeys with the aid of avaiable atlases showed considerable errors As these animals are valuable for primate visual system reseach an atlas was constructed with methods that have not been used before for rhesus In addition the specific connections from the visual cortices superior colliculus and retina to the thalamus and mesencephalon are also shown Anesthetized monkeys of specific body dimensions had a matrix of pins inserted into the brain before fixation A matrix was used so that the penetrations seen in the sectioned brain could be cross related as a control for accurate measurements of the stereotaxic planes throughout the brain The surface of the whole brain frozen blocks were photographed on the microtome just before a cut section was taken These calibrated pictures formed the floor plan of the atlas as they represent more accurately the brain geometry than individual sections which are distorted by cutting staining and mounting Cytoarchitectural Nissl stain and axonal connectional Fink-Heimer stain information was transferred and adjusted onto the block pictures from their corresponding stained sections Follow up experiments showed that the present coordinates are accurate for these monkeys of restricted body dimensions In addition referencing visual axonal projections onto the same cytoarchitectural map in stereotaxic coordinates provides an atlas for localizing areas of the thalamus on a basis other than cytoarchitecture which receive combinations of visual inputs for further anatomical and physiological studies of the rhesus monkey visual system The atlas further demonstrates that projections do not necessarily follow the cytoarchitectural definition of an area but rather redefine the thalamus on the basis of specific axonal connections nan\n",

New morphologic data. New physiopathologic interpretations] Considerable progress has been made over the last few years in our knowledge of the thalamus and basal ganglia and their relationships to the cerebral cortex More detailed topographic studies in the macaque have demonstrated the separation in the lateral region of the thalamus between afferent cerebellar and basal ganglia territories These territories fail to correlate with the subdivision between ventral and dorsal elements or the limits of a single cytoarchitectonic nucleus The cerebellar territory corresponds to VIL or VPLo which projects towards the primary cortex and to VIM or area X and DI or VLc which project towards premotor cortex The nigral and tectal territory corresponds to VOM or VAmc and to some parts of the medial nucleus and projects mainly towards the oculomotor area supplementary motor area and prefrontal cortex In return the oculomotor area and substantia nigra project towards the colliculus superior Several thalamic nuclei constitute the pallidal territory VOL or VLo projects mainly towards supplementary motor area LPo or VApc and Do towards the prefrontal cortex The median center which receives afferents from pallidum and motor cortex projects towards the striatum but also the motor cortex The parafascicular nucleus projects towards the striatum and premotor cortex It is still not possible to transpose data acquired in the macaque to man but functional reinterpretations are possible A system which involves the median pallidum VOL and supplementary motor area could control motor initiative and flow of movement A second system involving the substantia nigra colliculus superior thalamic relay and oculomotor area could control posture The pallidum and substantia nigra anterior part of lateral mass medial nucleus and prefrontal cortex could elaborate motor programmes nan\n",

A series of experiments examined the effects of selective diencephalic lesions upon object recognition in the cynomolgus monkey Macaca fascicularis In the first experiment it was found that extensive lesions of the medial thalamus MT produced a severe deficit in both relearning the recognition task and subsequently performing with retention intervals longer than  sec Additional experiments showed that more selective lesions in either the anterior medial thalamus AMT the posterior medial thalamus PMT or the medial mamillary nucleus MB only produced mild recognition memory impairments It is argued that a combination of damage is required to produce the severe memory impairments observed in cases of global diencephalic amnesia nan\n",

Although vertical gaze palsy VGP is commonly associated with lesions of the rostral mesencephalon there is some evidence that VGP may also be caused by a unilateral thalamic lesion The case of a -year-old man with persistent upward gaze palsy after a unilateral thalamic infarction demonstrated on computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging scans is presented Subsequent high-resolution magnetic resonance scanning however showed involvement of the rostral mesencephalon as well The authors suggest that in previous patients with VGP ascribed to a unilateral thalamic infarction a coexisting mesencephalic involvement may have been missed because of inappropriate imaging techniques Strong evidence of unilateral thalamic infarction as a cause of VGP is still lacking nan\n",
