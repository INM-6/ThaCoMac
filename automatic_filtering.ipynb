In addition to specific subcortical and cortical afferents, the primate thalamus receives axons containing the neuromodulators acetylcholine (Heckers et al., 1992 ), histamine ( Manning et al., 1996 ), serotonin (Morrison and Foote, 1986; Lavoie and Parent, 1991 ), and the catecholamines adrenaline ( Rico and Cavada, 1998a ), noradrenaline (Morrison and Foote, 1986; Ginsberg et al., 1993 ) and dopamine (Sánchez-González et al., 2005 ). Until recently, the existence of significant dopamine innervation in the primate thalamus has been largely ignored, probably becausedopamine innervation of the rodent thalamus is very scant(Groenewegen, 1988; Papadopoulos and Parnavelas, 1990 ). However, fragmentary data scattered through the literature endorse the presence of dopamine innervation in the primate thalamus.Postmortem biochemical studies showed the presence of dopamine in the thalamus of macaques ( Brown et al., 1979; Goldman-Rakic and Brown, 1981; Pifl et al., 1990, 1991 ) and human subjects ( Oke and Adams, 1987 ).

YOUAKIM Department of Physiology and Biophysics, School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, University at Buffalo, State University of New York, Buffalo, New York 14214 Received 29 December 1999; accepted in final form 21 September 2000 Bender, D. B. and M. Youakim. Effect of attentive fixation in macaque thalamus and cortex. J Neurophysiol 85: 219234, 2001. Attentional modulation of neuronal responsiveness is common in many areas of visual cortex. We examined whether attentional modulation in the visual thalamus was quantitatively similar to that in cortex. Identical procedures and apparatus were used to compare attentional modulation of single neurons in seven different areas of the visual system: the lateral geniculate, three visual subdivisions of the pulvinar [inferior, lateral, dorsomedial part of lateral pulvinar (Pdm)], and three areas of extrastriate cortex representing early, intermediate, and late stages of cortical processing (V2, V4/PM, area 7a). A simple fixation task controlled transitions among three attentive states. The animal waited for a fixation point to appear (ready state), fixated the point until it dimmed (fixation state), and then waited idly to begin the next trial (idle state). Attentional modulation was estimated by flashing an identical, irrelevant stimulus in a neurons receptive field during each of the three states; the three responses defined a response vector whose deviation from the line of equal response in all three states (the main diagonal) indicated the character and magnitude of attentional modulation. Attentional modulation was present in all visual areas except the lateral geniculate, indicating that modulation was of central origin. Prevalence of modulation was modest (26%) in pulvinar, and increased from 21% in V2 to 43% in 7a. Modulation had a push-pull character (as many cells facilitated as suppressed) with respect to the fixation state in all areas except Pdm where all cells were suppressed during fixation. The absolute magnitude of attentional modulation, measured by the angle between response vector and main diagonal expressed as a percent of the maximum possible angle, differed among brain areas. Magnitude of modulation was modest in the pulvinar (1926%), and increased from 22% in V2 to 41% in 7a. However, average trial-to-trial variability of response, measured by the coefficient of variation, also increased across brain areas so that its difference among areas accounted for more than 90% of the difference in modulation magnitude among areas. We also measured attentional modulation by the ratio of cell discharge due to attention divided by discharge variability. The resulting signal-tonoise ratio of attention was small and constant, 1.3 6 10%, across all areas of pulvinar and cortex. We conclude that the pulvinar, but not the lateral geniculate, is as strongly affected by attentional state as any area of visual cortex we studied and that attentional modulation amplitude is closely tied to intrinsic variability of response. INTRODUCTION It is now clear that attention can affect the responsiveness of neurons throughout visual cortex. Visually responsive cortex includes a number of distinct areas beyond striate cortex, or V1. Beginning with V2, these extrastriate areas are organized into two partially segregated, roughly hierarchical systems (reviews in Felleman and Van Essen 1991; Maunsell and Newsome 1987; Ungerleider and Mishkin 1982; Van Essen 1985). One includes dorsally located areas such as V3A, MT, and MST and leads into area 7a in the inferior parietal lobule. The other includes more ventrally located areas such as V4 and TEO and leads into area TE in the temporal lobe. Recordings from single neurons in many of these areas show that neuronal excitability depends on the animals attentive state (reviews in Colby 1991; Desimone and Duncan 1995; Lock and Bender 1999; Maunsell 1995; Motter 1998). Typically the effect of attention is modest: a small increase or decrease in magnitude of response to a visual stimulus relative to a control condition. Such modulation can be found at virtually every level of the cortical hierarchy, including V1. A variety of behavioral paradigms have been used to manipulate attention, and these show that the prevalence and magnitude of attentional modulation can depend substantially on both the behavioral paradigm and the cortical area in which its effects are measured. Furthermore factors such as task difficulty, the extent to which a task engages the functions of an area, and whether multiple stimuli compete for attention all can affect the modulation (Luck et al. 1997; Motter 1993; Richmond and Sato 1987). To what extent does the thalamus contribute to, or participate in, the attentional modulation that is so widespread throughout visual cortex? Three thalamic nuclei are closely interrelated with visual cortex: the lateral geniculate nucleus, the pulvinar, and the reticular nucleus of the thalamus. All have been thought to be involved in one form of attention or another (e.g., Guillery et al. 1998; Koch and Ullman 1985; Olshausen et al. 1993). The lateral geniculate projects almost exclusively to V1 with little or no output to extrastriate cortex. Layer 6 of both extrastriate and striate cortex project back to the geniculate, potentially modulating transmission through it. The pulvinar has at least three distinct visual subdivisions. The inferior (PI) and lateral pulvinar (PL) contain two separate visuotopic maps (Bender 1981). PI is driven by input from V1 (Bender 1983) but also receives input from extrastriate cortex and the superior colliculus. It projects mainly to V2, V3, V3A, and MT. PL likewise receives input from V1 and extrastriate cortex, but may have a particular affinity\"\n",

The lateral route, named \"lateral grasping network\", is mainly involved in the control of the distal part of prehension, namely grasping and manipulation. The medial route, named \"reach-to-grasp network\", is involved in the control of the full deployment of prehension act, from the direction of arm movement to the shaping of the hand according to the object to be grasped. In macaque monkeys, the reach-to-grasp network (the target of this review) includes areas of the superior parietal lobule (SPL) that hosts visual and somatosensory neurons well suited to control goal-directed limb movements toward stationary as well as moving objects. After a brief summary of the neuronal functional properties of these areas, we will analyze their cortical and thalamic inputs thanks to retrograde neuronal tracers separately injected into the SPL areas V6, V6A, PEc, and PE. These areas receive visual and somatosensory information distributed in a caudorostral, visuosomatic trend, and some of them are directly connected with the dorsal premotor cortex. This review is particularly focused on the origin and type of visual information reaching the SPL, and on the functional role this information can play in guiding limb interaction with objects in structured and dynamic environments.

YOUAKIM Department of Physiology and Biophysics, School of Medicine and Biomedical Sciences, University at Buffalo, State University of New York, Buffalo, New York 14214 Received 29 December 1999; accepted in final form 21 September 2000 Bender, D. B. and M. Youakim. Effect of attentive fixation in macaque thalamus and cortex. J Neurophysiol 85: 219234, 2001. Attentional modulation of neuronal responsiveness is common in many areas of visual cortex. We examined whether attentional modulation in the visual thalamus was quantitatively similar to that in cortex. Identical procedures and apparatus were used to compare attentional modulation of single neurons in seven different areas of the visual system: the lateral geniculate, three visual subdivisions of the pulvinar [inferior, lateral, dorsomedial part of lateral pulvinar (Pdm)], and three areas of extrastriate cortex representing early, intermediate, and late stages of cortical processing (V2, V4/PM, area 7a). A simple fixation task controlled transitions among three attentive states. The animal waited for a fixation point to appear (ready state), fixated the point until it dimmed (fixation state), and then waited idly to begin the next trial (idle state). Attentional modulation was estimated by flashing an identical, irrelevant stimulus in a neurons receptive field during each of the three states; the three responses defined a response vector whose deviation from the line of equal response in all three states (the main diagonal) indicated the character and magnitude of attentional modulation. Attentional modulation was present in all visual areas except the lateral geniculate, indicating that modulation was of central origin. Prevalence of modulation was modest (26%) in pulvinar, and increased from 21% in V2 to 43% in 7a. Modulation had a push-pull character (as many cells facilitated as suppressed) with respect to the fixation state in all areas except Pdm where all cells were suppressed during fixation. The absolute magnitude of attentional modulation, measured by the angle between response vector and main diagonal expressed as a percent of the maximum possible angle, differed among brain areas. Magnitude of modulation was modest in the pulvinar (1926%), and increased from 22% in V2 to 41% in 7a. However, average trial-to-trial variability of response, measured by the coefficient of variation, also increased across brain areas so that its difference among areas accounted for more than 90% of the difference in modulation magnitude among areas. We also measured attentional modulation by the ratio of cell discharge due to attention divided by discharge variability. The resulting signal-tonoise ratio of attention was small and constant, 1.3 6 10%, across all areas of pulvinar and cortex. We conclude that the pulvinar, but not the lateral geniculate, is as strongly affected by attentional state as any area of visual cortex we studied and that attentional modulation amplitude is closely tied to intrinsic variability of response. INTRODUCTION It is now clear that attention can affect the responsiveness of neurons throughout visual cortex. Visually responsive cortex includes a number of distinct areas beyond striate cortex, or V1. Beginning with V2, these extrastriate areas are organized into two partially segregated, roughly hierarchical systems (reviews in Felleman and Van Essen 1991; Maunsell and Newsome 1987; Ungerleider and Mishkin 1982; Van Essen 1985). One includes dorsally located areas such as V3A, MT, and MST and leads into area 7a in the inferior parietal lobule. The other includes more ventrally located areas such as V4 and TEO and leads into area TE in the temporal lobe. Recordings from single neurons in many of these areas show that neuronal excitability depends on the animals attentive state (reviews in Colby 1991; Desimone and Duncan 1995; Lock and Bender 1999; Maunsell 1995; Motter 1998). Typically the effect of attention is modest: a small increase or decrease in magnitude of response to a visual stimulus relative to a control condition. Such modulation can be found at virtually every level of the cortical hierarchy, including V1. A variety of behavioral paradigms have been used to manipulate attention, and these show that the prevalence and magnitude of attentional modulation can depend substantially on both the behavioral paradigm and the cortical area in which its effects are measured. Furthermore factors such as task difficulty, the extent to which a task engages the functions of an area, and whether multiple stimuli compete for attention all can affect the modulation (Luck et al. 1997; Motter 1993; Richmond and Sato 1987). To what extent does the thalamus contribute to, or participate in, the attentional modulation that is so widespread throughout visual cortex? Three thalamic nuclei are closely interrelated with visual cortex: the lateral geniculate nucleus, the pulvinar, and the reticular nucleus of the thalamus. All have been thought to be involved in one form of attention or another (e.g., Guillery et al. 1998; Koch and Ullman 1985; Olshausen et al. 1993). The lateral geniculate projects almost exclusively to V1 with little or no output to extrastriate cortex. Layer 6 of both extrastriate and striate cortex project back to the geniculate, potentially modulating transmission through it. The pulvinar has at least three distinct visual subdivisions. The inferior (PI) and lateral pulvinar (PL) contain two separate visuotopic maps (Bender 1981). PI is driven by input from V1 (Bender 1983) but also receives input from extrastriate cortex and the superior colliculus. It projects mainly to V2, V3, V3A, and MT. PL likewise receives input from V1 and extrastriate cortex, but may have a particular affinity\"\n",
