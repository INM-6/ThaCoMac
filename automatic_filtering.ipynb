    "# text = 'Vision for action: thalamic and cortical inputs to the macaque superior tract neural tracing, parietal lobule The dorsal visual stream, the cortical circuit that in the primate brain is mainly dedicated to the visual control of actions, is split into two routes, a lateral and a medial one, both involved in coding different aspects of sensorimotor control of actions. The lateral route, named \"lateral grasping network\", is mainly involved in the control of the distal part of prehension, namely grasping and manipulation. The medial route, named \"reach-to-grasp network\", is involved in the control of the full deployment of prehension act, from the direction of arm movement to the shaping of the hand according to the object to be grasped. In macaque monkeys, the reach-to-grasp network (the target of this review) includes areas of the superior parietal lobule (SPL) that hosts visual and somatosensory neurons well suited to control goal-directed limb movements toward stationary as well as moving objects. After a brief summary of the neuronal functional properties of these areas, we will analyze their cortical and thalamic inputs thanks to retrograde neuronal tracers separately injected into the SPL areas V6, V6A, PEc, and PE. These areas receive visual and somatosensory information distributed in a caudorostral, visuosomatic trend, and some of them are directly connected with the dorsal premotor cortex. This review is particularly focused on the origin and type of visual information reaching the SPL, and on the functional role this information can play in guiding limb interaction with objects in structured and dynamic environments. Area PEc; Area V6; Area V6A; Dorsal visual stream; Goal-directed arm movement; Sensorimotor integration.'\n",

In this chapter we review the brain's strategies for keeping track of fast, saccadic eye movements. One way it does this is by monitoring copies of saccadic motor commands, or corollary discharges. It has been difficult to identify corollary discharge signals in the primate brain, although in some studies the influence of corollary discharge, for example on visual processing, has been found. We propose four criteria for identifying corollary discharge signals in primate brain based on our experiences studying a pathway from superior colliculus, in the brainstem, through mediodorsal thalamus to frontal eye field, in the prefrontal cortex. First, the signals must originate from a brain structure involved in generating movements. Second, they must begin just prior to movements and represent spatial attributes of the movements. Third, eliminating the signals should not impair movements in simple tasks not requiring corollary discharge. Fourth, eliminating the signals should, however, disrupt movements in tasks that require corollary discharge, such as a double-step task in which the monkey must keep track of one saccade in order to correctly generate another. Applying these criteria to the pathway from superior colliculus to frontal eye field, we concluded that it does indeed convey corollary discharge signals. The extent to which cerebral cortex actually uses these signals, particularly in the realm of sensory perception, remains unknown pending further studies. Moreover, many other ascending pathways from brainstem to cortex remain to be explored in behaving monkeys, and some of these, too, may carry corollary discharge signals. nan; FRONTAL EYE FIELD; MONKEY SUPERIOR COLLICULUS; ORIENTING GAZE SHIFTS; HEAD-FREE CAT; RHESUS-MONKEY; TECTORETICULOSPINAL SYSTEM; VISUAL-CORTEX; REVERSIBLE INACTIVATION; VISUOMOTOR FUNCTIONS; CENTRAL THALAMUS\n",

This chapter attempts to define the anatomical organization of the prefrontal cortex OMPFC in macaque monkeys including its architectonic structure and intrinsic and extrinsic connections in hopes that this will enable more complete analysis of its function Lesions of the OMPFC such as reported in the classical case of Phineas Gage and in similar contemporary cases have been reported to produce disturbances in emotional reactions to sensory stimuli and disruption of social conduct so severe that they constitute a radical change in personality Although the basis for this deficit remains unclear it has been suggested that it is related to disconnection of pathways between the cortex and autonomic systems that govern visceral responses normally associated with affective stimuli The results indicate that the OMPFC like other cortical regions is composed of a number of relatively discrete cortical areas Each of these areas has distinct structure and connections and presumably plays a distinct functional role within the overall function of the region nan; CAUDOLATERAL ORBITOFRONTAL CORTEX; MEDIODORSAL THALAMIC NUCLEUS; MACAQUE MONKEY; MACACA-FASCICULARIS; FRONTAL-CORTEX; SINGLE NEURONS; RHESUS-MONKEY; PROJECTIONS; CONNECTIONS; AREAS\n",

      "A Pharmaco–Magnetic Resonance Imaging Study Context  Ketamine evokes psychosislike symptoms and its primary action is to impair N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor neurotransmission but it also induces secondary increases in glutamate release Objectives  To identify the sites of action of ketamine in inducing symptoms and to determine the role of increased glutamate release using the glutamate release inhibitor lamotrigine Design  Two experiments with different participants were performed using a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized crossover counterbalanced-order design In the first experiment the effect of intravenous ketamine hydrochloride on regional blood oxygenation leveldependent BOLD signal and correlated symptoms was compared with intravenous saline placebo In the second experiment pretreatment with lamotrigine was compared with placebo to identify which effects of ketamine are mediated by increased glutamate release Setting  Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility Manchester England Participants  Thirty-three healthy right-handed men were recruited by advertisements Interventions  In experiment  participants were given intravenous ketamine -minute bolus of  mgkg followed by a maintenance infusion of  mgkgh for the remainder of the session or placebo  saline solution In experiment  participants were pretreated with  mg of lamotrigine or placebo and then were given the same doses of ketamine as in experiment  Main Outcome Measures  Regional BOLD signal changes during ketamine or placebo infusion and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale scores Results  Ketamine induced a rapid focal and unexpected decrease in ventromedial frontal cortex including orbitofrontal cortex and subgenual cingulate which strongly predicted its dissociative effects and increased activity in mid-posterior cingulate thalamus and temporal cortical regions r   Activations correlated with Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale psychosis scores Lamotrigine pretreatment prevented many of the BOLD signal changes and the symptoms Conclusions  These  changes may underpin  fundamental processes of psychosis abnormal perceptual experiences and impaired cognitive-emotional evaluation of their significance The results are compatible with the theory that the neural and subjective effects of ketamine involve increased glutamate release  nan; HEALTHY-VOLUNTEERS; POSTERIOR CINGULATE; M-CHLOROPHENYLPIPERAZINE; PHARMACOKINETIC MODEL; FUNCTIONAL MRI; BRAIN ACTIVITY; RHESUS-MONKEY; BLOOD-FLOW; SCHIZOPHRENIA; PSYCHOSIS\n",
